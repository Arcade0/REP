TITLE:Clindamycin vs penicillin for anaerobic lung infections. High rate of penicillin failures associated with penicillin-resistant Bacteroides melaninogenicus.
ABSTRACT:Thirty-seven adult patients with anaerobic lung infections (27 lung abscesses and 10 necrotizing pneumonias) were submitted to transthoracic needle-aspiration and/or bronchoscopic specimen brush cultures before therapy and thereafter in all cases considered to be failures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either clindamycin, 600 mg intravenously every 6 hours, or penicillin G, 2 million U every 4 hours for no less than 8 days, until clinical and radiological improvement became apparent. Treatment was continued orally with clindamycin, 300 mg every 6 hours, or penicillin V, 750 mg every 6 hours, until completing a minimum of 4 weeks. Ten of the 47 anaerobes initially isolated from the lung (nine Bacteroides melaninogenicus and one Bacteroides capillosus) were resistant to penicillin, but none were resistant to clindamycin. Five of the nine patients harboring these penicillin-resistant Bacteroides received penicillin, and all failed to respond to therapy. Overall, eight of the 18 patients in the penicillin group and one of 19 in the clindamycin group failed to respond to therapy. These drugs were equally well tolerated in both groups. The presence of penicillin-resistant Bacteroides is a frequent cause of penicillin failure in patients with anaerobic lung infections. In this setting, clindamycin appears to be the current therapy of choice for initial treatment.

题目:克林霉素vs青霉素治疗厌氧肺部感染。青霉素的高失败率与耐青霉素类黑素原杆菌有关。
摘要:37例肺部厌氧感染的成人患者(27例肺脓肿和10例坏死性肺炎)在治疗前接受了经胸穿刺和/或支气管镜标本刷培养，之后所有的病例都被认为是失败的。患者被随机分配给克林霉素，每6小时静脉注射600毫克，或青霉素G，每4小时200万U，持续不少于8天，直到临床和放射学的改善变得明显。继续口服克林霉素，每6小时300毫克，或青霉素V，每6小时750毫克，直到至少完成4周。最初从肺中分离的47种厌氧菌中有10种(9种黑素原拟杆菌和1种毛细拟杆菌)对青霉素耐药，但没有一种对克林霉素耐药。9名携带这些耐青霉素类拟杆菌的患者中，有5名接受了青霉素治疗，但均未对治疗产生反应。总的来说，青霉素组的18名患者中有8名，克林霉素组的19名患者中有1名对治疗无效。两组患者对这些药物的耐受性相同。青霉素耐药类杆菌的存在是青霉素失效的一个常见原因在厌氧肺感染患者。在这种情况下，克林霉素似乎是目前初始治疗的首选疗法。"

TITLE:Empyema caused by Clostridium sordellii, a rare form of pleuropulmonary disease.
ABSTRACT:Clostridia species are rarely isolated from pleuropulmonary infections in the absence of antecedent trauma. We record the second case reported in the English literature of pneumonia and empyema associated with Clostridium sordelli. This infection is probably acquired through aspiration of oropharyngeal flora and may be associated pulmonary embolism and valvular heart disease. Therapy of empyema associated with C. sordelli should consist of tube thoracostomy as well as penicillin with or without metronidazole or the combination of vancomycin and metronidazole in penicillin-allergic patients.

ABSTRACT:We report two different cases of bacteremia caused by two recently described Selenomonas species, Selenomonas artemidis and Selenomonas infelix. Both species are normally found in human buccal flora. S. artemidis bacteremia appeared in a patient (number 1) who presented with an air-fluid pulmonary cavity and clinical conditions consistent with an anaerobic lung abscess. While the patient improved with antibiotic therapy, cultures of respiratory secretions yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This case demonstrated a strong possibility of a coexisting lung abscess due to S. artemidis. S. infelix bacteremia appeared in a cancer patient (number 2) with heart disease during preterminal acute respiratory distress. It was more difficult in this case to assess the clinical impact of the Selenomonas organisms on the patient.

TITLE:Necrotizing pneumonia and empyema caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium bifermentans.
ABSTRACT:A patient with no known immune compromise presented with necrotizing pneumonia and a pleural effusion. Thoracentesis yielded a sanguinopurulent, foul smelling exudate that showed sheets of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and many gram-positive bacilli. A tube thoracostomy was performed and treatment with intravenous penicillin G was begun. Twenty-four hours later a Bacillus species later identified as Bacillus cereus was identified from aerobic cultures. Because the organism was resistant to penicillin, the patient was switched to intravenous chloramphenicol. A second organism was noted to grow slowly under anaerobic conditions and was later identified as Clostridium bifermentans. Despite initial clinical improvement, fever and empyema persisted resulting in a thoracotomy with resection of the infected lung and extensive decortication. Specimens from the lung tissue obtained at surgery also grew both Bacillus cereus and Clostridium bifermentans. Subsequent review of the original pleural fluid smears revealed a degree of pleomorphism that was not initially appreciated. Prompt surgical intervention combined with appropriate antibiotics resulted in a cure of this unusual aerobic/anaerobic infection.

TITLE:Serious infection with Leptotrichia buccalis. Report of a case and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:Leptotrichia buccalis is an obligately anaerobic, gram-negative rod classified as a member of the family Bacteroidaceae. Organisms found in this family (Bacteroides and Fusobacteria) are frequent causes of severe infection in human beings. L. buccalis is a constituent of normal oral flora. Leptotrichia has rarely been recovered from mixed infections primarily of the head and neck. It has not previously been reported as a cause of serious infection in man. We report a case of cavitary pneumonia and septicemia caused by L. buccalis. The colonial morphology and gram stain of L. buccalis are characteristic. Definitive identification is made by gas-liquid chromatography. Leptotrichia have been shown to contain potent endotoxin. L. buccalis has the potential to be a virulent, pathogenic microorganism, especially in the compromised host.

Most Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). Predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). The micro-organisms most commonly isolated with Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (108), Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (95), Escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). Most Bacteroides spp. and E. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most Fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. beta-Lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. All patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. Four patients died from their infection.

TITLE:[Anaerobic Propionibacterium in opportunistic infections].
ABSTRACT:In three cases, two of which regarded exudative pericardium inflammation and one of lung abscess, biopsy revealed negative bacteriological results. Blood cultures resulted in culture of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria from Propionibacterium genus. Precise chemo- geno-taxonomic studies were performed which confirmed generic identification of isolated strains. These were following: in cell wall--L-DAP, alanine, glycine, galactose, glucose, mannose; lack if mycolic acids; %GC 58-59. Basing on additional bacteriological studies it was established that two strains belong to the genus Propionibacterium acnes (type I), while third strain appeared to be Propionibacterium propionicum (before Arachnia propionica). These results confirm growing participation of relative pathogenic bacteria in opportunistic infections. It suggests necessity of blood cultures in cases subjected to prolonged therapy, especially when immunosuppression is involved.

ABSTRACT:A case of Lemierre's syndrome is reported in which metastatic abscesses resulted from septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein secondary to bacterial pharyngitis. A 32-year-old male suffering from a painful left-sided neck mass, sore throat, and fever was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography revealed thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein, septic pulmonary emboli, and a liver abscess. Blood culture showed Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Although empyema occurred transiently during the treatment, the patient recovered following prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Although Fusobacterium species are a well-known cause of Lemierre's syndrome, cases in whom Porphyromonas species was isolated have scarcely been reported. Moreover, case reports from Japan have been few.

TITLE:Adult botulism type F in the United States, 1981-2002.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, and E cause most cases of the paralytic disease botulism. Little is known about the epidemiology, clinical features, or microbiology of botulism type F. 
METHODS: Cases of adult type F botulism were identified by review of data collected by CDC's National Botulism Surveillance System between 1981 and 2002. A case was either an individual whose serum or stool demonstrated type F toxin or whose stool culture yielded an organism producing toxin type F. A detailed review of cases' medical charts and laboratory data from CDC and local health departments was performed. 
RESULTS: Between 1981 and 2002, 1,269 cases of botulism among adults and infants were reported to CDC; 13 (1%) were adult type F. The median age of type F cases was 54 years; 7 (54%) were female. None were part of outbreaks. A toxigenic Clostridium baratii was identified in 9 (69%) of 13 cases. Among 11 cases for which clinical data were available, all required mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 17 days (range, 10 to 84); 8 (73%) were intubated within 24 hours of symptom onset. All patients had nearly complete or complete quadriplegia at the nadir of neurologic dysfunction, which occurred on average on day 5. On average by day 8, improvement in neuromuscular function was noted. The median duration of acute hospitalization was 31 days (range, 20 to 60). No deaths were reported. In only one case was a possible foodborne etiology identified. 
CONCLUSIONS: Toxigenic C baratii are the sole documented causes of type F botulism in the United States since 1981. These cases are characterized by a fulminant course with rapid progression to respiratory failure and paralysis, making early recognition and intervention critical to appropriate management.

题目:1981-2002年美国成人F型肉毒杆菌中毒。
文摘:
背景:A、B、E型肉毒梭菌神经毒素是麻痹性疾病肉毒中毒的主要病因。对于F型肉毒杆菌中毒的流行病学、临床特征或微生物学了解甚少。
方法:通过对1981年至2002年CDC全国肉毒中毒监测系统收集的数据进行分析，确定成人F型肉毒中毒病例。1例患者的血清或粪便显示为F型毒素，或其粪便培养产生F型毒素的有机体。对病例的医学图表和来自疾病预防控制中心和当地卫生部门的实验室数据进行了详细审查。
结果:1981 - 2002年，美国疾病控制与预防中心共报告成人和婴儿肉毒杆菌中毒病例1269例;成年F型患者13例(1%)，F型患者中位年龄54岁;7(54%)为女性。这些都不是疫情的一部分。13例中有9例(69%)发现了产毒的巴尔氏梭菌。在有临床资料的11例患者中，所有患者均需要机械通气，中位时间为17天(范围为10至84天);8例(73%)在症状出现24小时内插管。所有患者均在神经功能障碍最严重时出现几乎完全或完全的四肢瘫，平均发生在第5天。平均到第8天，神经肌肉功能得到改善。急性住院时间中位数为31天(范围为20至60天)。没有死亡报告。只有一个病例被确定为可能的食源性病因。
结论:产毒C baratii是1981年以来美国唯一有记录的F型肉毒中毒原因。这些病例的特点是暴发性发展为呼吸衰竭和瘫痪，早期发现和干预对适当的治疗至关重要。"

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Primary foci of necrobacillosis infection outside the head and neck are uncommon but have been reported in the urogenital or gastrointestinal tracts. Reports of infection with Solobacterium moorei are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old male intravenous drug user was admitted with pain in his right groin, fever, rigors and vomiting following a recent injection into the right femoral vein. Admission blood cultures grew Fusobacterium nucleatum, Solobacterium moorei and Bacteroides ureolyticus. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous penicillin and metronidazole. 
CONCLUSION: This case report describes an unusual case of femoral thrombophlebitis with septic pulmonary embolism associated with anaerobic organisms in a groin abscess. Solobacterium moorei, though rarely described, may also have clinically significant pathogenic potential.

TITLE:Pulmonary actinomycosis complicating infliximab therapy for Crohn disease.
ABSTRACT:The use of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents has expanded significantly over the past few years, particularly for rheumatological diseases and Crohn disease. A number of associated opportunistic infections have been observed as a result of suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity, the most frequent being tuberculosis. This report describes a case of pulmonary actinomycosis in a 52-year-old patient receiving regular infusions of infliximab, an anti-TNF agent, for Crohn disease. He presented with a 12-day history of fever, night sweats and a non-productive cough on a background of a 9-year history of Crohn terminal ileitis. There was radiological evidence of a left upper lobe non-cavitatory pneumonia and bronchoscopic lavage fluid eventually grew Actinomyces graevenitzii. The patient was hospitalised and improved with antibiotic therapy. Within 4 weeks there was almost complete radiological resolution and infliximab was restarted after 4 months without further complication.

ABSTRACT:Actinomyces cardiffensis is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming rod that was first identified by Hall et al. (Hall V. et al. (2002) J Clin Microbiol 40:3427-31). Here we report a case of bacteremia with liver and lung abscesses associated with A. cardiffensis. A 67-year-old man was hospitalized with fever and headache for 20 days. Blood culture revealed an Actinomyces species, which was ultimately identified as A. cardiffensis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A computed tomography scan of his chest showed small abscesses in his lung and liver. After a 3-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient showed rapid improvement. The patient was transitioned to oral amoxicillin for the remainder of his antibiotic treatment.

TITLE:Pulmonary Actinomyces graevenitzii infection presenting as organizing pneumonia diagnosed by PCR analysis.
ABSTRACT:We report what is believed to be the first case of pulmonary Actinomyces graevenitzii infection presenting as organizing pneumonia. Fever and night sweats developed in a 69-year-old male. The only abnormal laboratory data were an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. On chest images, multiple consolidations with air bronchograms were seen in the bilateral lungs. Histological examination from lung biopsy revealed a pattern of organizing pneumonia with microabscesses, but definitive diagnosis was not obtained because culture from lung specimen was negative. A. graevenitzii was eventually identified in the lung biopsy specimen by detection of an Actinomyces-specific PCR product followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The patient was treated with high-dose ampicillin intravenously for 1 month, followed by oral amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 6 months, and recovered. We suggest that actinomycosis can present as organizing pneumonia, and identification of infection by PCR analysis and rRNA gene sequencing is a useful strategy in cases that are difficult to diagnose.

One week prior to presentation the patient reported a history of sore throat which he presumed to be a viral infection and sought no medical attention. Upon hospital presentation, the patient was admitted and rapidly progressed to sepsis and respiratory failure. Goal directed therapy was initiated and the patient was intubated. Further clinical work up included blood cultures revealing Fusobacterium varium bacteraemia, and CT and ultrasound imaging demonstrated thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and septic pulmonary emboli. A diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome was made, and antibiotics as well as anticoagulation therapy were initiated. The patient's clinical condition improved with treatment, and he was discharged home on hospital day 12 with completion of an uneventful 4-week course of outpatient antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy.

ABSTRACT:We herein present the first case of pulmonary actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces cardiffensis (A. cardiffensis). A computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a nodule with cavitation in the left upper lobe of the lung. One month later, the lesion had almost disappeared, but a new nodule with peripheral consolidation had appeared in the right middle lobe. Because organizing pneumonia was suspected, prednisolone was begun and improvement was seen. However, two months after the initiation of corticosteroid administration, a chest CT scan showed a lung abscess. The patient underwent surgical resection of the abscess. A. cardiffensis was identified by an amplified 16S ribosomal DNA restriction analysis of a pus sample.

ABSTRACT:Lemierre's syndrome is only very rarely caused by Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Here, we report the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a left peritonsillar abscess, thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein, and septic embolization of both lungs. Anaerobic P. asaccharolytica was isolated in the blood cultures, and we subsequently confirmed the diagnosis as Lemierre's syndrome. Our case indicates that although P. asaccharolytica is not commonly found in oral cavities, this organism may still cause Lemierre's syndrome. Consequently, when it is detected in blood cultures, the treating physician should perform the medical examination while keeping in mind the possibility that the patient could have Lemierre's syndrome.

ABSTRACT:Eikenella corrodens is a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Pleuropulmonary infections by this microorganism are uncommon. Pulmonary aspiration is a chief predisposing condition. Although the outcome is usually favorable, its distinctive antibiotic sensitivity pattern makes bacterial identification an important feature in dealing with this infection. The authors report a case of pleural empyema caused by co-infection with Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, in an immunocompetent diabetic patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, followed by a discussion on the role of noninvasive ventilation in the development of this infection.

ABSTRACT:In this study we analyzed the characteristics of patients with pleural effusion secondary to Streptococcus milleri studied retrospectively between January and March 2013 and found seven patients with a mean age of 60 years, 43% of which were smokers and 57% with a drinking habit. The most common associated factors were alcoholism, previous pneumonia and diabetes. Other bacteria were identified as Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides and Prevotella intermedia capillosus in two patients. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy was 28 days; six patients underwent pleural drainage by chest tube and one patient needed surgery due to poor clinical progress. The mean duration of hospitalization was 30 days with satisfactory outcome in all cases, despite some changes in residual function.

ABSTRACT:Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis or lung cancer. Actinomyces graevenitzii is a relatively new recognized Actinomyces species isolated from various clinical samples. The authors report a case of pulmonary actinomycosis caused by A graevenitzii. A computed tomography examination revealed an excavated consolidation in the middle right lobe of a previously healthy young man who presented with a long history of moderate cough. Cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary abscess caused by A gravenitzii. At the three-month follow-up consultation and, after six weeks of high-dose amoxicillin, the pulmonary lesion had completely disappeared.

ABSTRACT:A case of pneumonia with associated empyema caused by Clostridium bifermentans is described. C bifermentans is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacillus. This organism is infrequently reported as a cause of infection in humans, and older publications tended to regard it as nonpathogenic. However, in more recent reports, C bifermentans has been documented as a cause of septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, soft tissue infection, abdominal infections, brain abscess, bacteremia and endocarditis. The present case is the third reported case of empyema caused by C bifermentans, and it serves to further define the spectrum of illness due to this uncommon organism.

ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Clostridium baratii is rarely associated with human diseases. Infection is usuallcaused by ingestion of contaminated food, and infant botulism is the most common clinical presentation. CASE REPORT: Here we report a case of pneumonia by a non-toxigenic strain of C. baratii in an Alzheimer 70-year-old male with sepsis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The micro-organism was identified by phenotypical tests, mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), DNA amplification (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Testing for the presence of botulinum F toxin was made using multiplex PCR. Bioassay for a large number of colonies was performed in mice to evaluate the production of any lethal toxin, but the results were negative. 
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, there are no cases of C. baratii infection reported in Brazil and we highlight the importance of anaerobic lab tests in the standard routine of diagnosis.

ABSTRACT:We report a rare case of lung abscess due to Eubacterium brachy. In this case, an analysis of the aspirate from frank pus revealed Gram-positive coccobacilli. We initially strongly suspected lung abscess associated with actinomycosis because of the chronic/recurrent clinical course and radio-pathological findings such as a granuloma lesion. Although a biochemical analysis revealed Actinomyces sp., 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a phylogenetic tree analysis of the isolated strain confirmed the presence of E. brachy. Some cases previously diagnosed as actinomycosis might be correctly diagnosed as E. brachy infection. Clinicians should be aware that additional studies using 16S rRNA gene sequencing are needed to clarify whether pulmonary infection associated with E. brachy is a similar entity to that of chronic granulomatous infection disease in pulmonary actinomycosis.

ABSTRACT:Actinomyces naeslundii is a commensal flora of the oral cavity and is generally considered as an avirulent saprophytic bacterium in immunocompetent patients. It can become an opportunistic anaerobic pathogen in oral cavity in patients with poor oral hygiene or tooth extraction and can cause periodontal disease. Pulmonary Actinomycosis is a rare manifestation and may be suspected in middle-aged male patients with cough and hemoptysis showing radiological findings of a peripheral mass or chronic consolidation in whom repeated aerobic cultures have yielded negative results. Here, we report isolation of A. naeslundii from the bronchoalveolar lavage sample from an immunocompetent patient who presented with chronic nonresolving pneumonia of 6 months duration.

TITLE:Cognitive Biases in the Era of COVID-19 : A Case of Clostridium sporogenes Bacteremia in a Patient with Small Bowel Obstruction.
ABSTRACT:Clostridium sporogenes bacteremia in immunocompetent patients is rare with very few reported cases in the literature. We present a case of Clostridium sporogenes bacteremia in an 81-year-old immunocompetent man with small bowel obstruction and hypoxemia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Routine monitoring of prognostic inflammatory markers for COVID-19 created a unique challenge in the management of our patient who developed sepsis with respiratory symptoms. Upon review, bacteremia from Clostridium sporogenes was associated with high mortality rates and could produce similar elevations in the inflammatory markers observed in COVID-19 pneumonia. Further, we reviewed the cognitive biases encountered when monitoring these inflammatory markers during the management of our patient with Clostridium sporogenes bacteremia, who was initially thought to have COVID-19 disease. While our patient ultimately tested negative for COVID-19, early administration of empiric antimicrobial therapy without source control failed to prevent clinical decompensation.

标题:COVID-19时代的认知偏差:一例小肠阻塞患者的芽孢梭菌血症。
摘要:在具有免疫能力的患者中发生芽孢梭菌血症是罕见的，文献报道的病例很少。我们提出一个81岁有免疫能力的男子在COVID-19大流行期间发生芽孢梭菌菌血症的病例，并发小肠阻塞和低氧血症。常规监测COVID-19的预后炎症标志物对处理出现脓毒症并伴有呼吸道症状的患者构成了独特的挑战。经审查，产孢梭菌菌血症与高死亡率相关，并可导致COVID-19肺炎中观察到的炎症标志物类似升高。此外，我们回顾了在治疗原认为患有COVID-19疾病的芽孢梭菌菌血症患者期间监测这些炎症标志物时遇到的认知偏差。虽然我们的患者最终检测为COVID-19阴性，但没有源头控制的早期经验性抗菌素治疗未能防止临床失代偿。"
