Infections of the urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections including decubitus ulcers, antibiotics associated diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infections are particularly important in the elderly because of their frequency. While most initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, its important before treatment to try to document the etiology for better use of antibiotics. Infections of the urinary tract are frequently and potentially serious in the elderly, they must be separated from asymptomatic bacteriuria that requires no therapy. Upper and lower urinary tract infections are frequently caused by aerobic gram negative bacilli and or enterococci. Most authors prefer the use of fluoroquinolones to manage such infections. The elderly with decubitus ulcer presents a problem in management, since these are frequent polymicrobic infections in which anaerobes play an important role. The initial therapy usually involves the combination of a fluoroquinolone plus an antianaerobic agent like clindamycin. C. difficile diarrhea as frequent in nursing home residents as well as the older person with prior antibiotics. The treatment should be with metronidazole and avoid the use of vancomycin. Pneumonias in the elderly can be acquired in the community, the nursing home or during a hospitalization. The etiologic agents that predominate change from S. pneumoniae and atypicals in those from the community to an increase in gram negative pneumonia. The initial treatment as started by most authors as well as guidelines include the use of a new fluoroquinolone like gatifloxacin alone or in combination with a beta-lactamic agent like ceftriaxone. For those infections acquired in the hospital therapy with third or fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, beta-lactams with betalactamase inhibitors alone or in combination with an aminoglucoside and or vancomycin if MRSA is suspected is accepted therapy."

","SPECIES:AnaerobesID:15571647TITLE:Appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy of nosocomial pneumonia: the role of the carbapenems.ABSTRACT:Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of death in patients with hospital-acquired infections. The development of nosocomial pneumonia prolongs hospitalization, which may cause additional days in the intensive care unit, thereby increasing overall health care costs. Empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia with therapies that are subsequently shown to be inappropriate therapy (defined as antimicrobial therapy that does not cover the infecting pathogens) has a detrimental effect on patient survival and can increase morbidity, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Delayed therapy can also have similar consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to begin treatment with the most appropriate regimen as soon as possible. This review considers the early use of appropriate, broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with nosocomial pneumonia and describes where and when the carbapenems are particularly useful. The carbapenems are active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes; resistance to carbapenems remains rare."

The source of the anaerobic bacteria is the oropharyngeal bacterial flora, where these organisms outnumber aerobic and facultative organisms in a 10:1 ratio. The most common lower respiratory tract infections where anaerobic bacteria are recovered mixed with aerobic organisms are aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema. The predominant isolated anaerobic bacteria are Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group. Management of these infections includes the administration of antimicrobials effective against the anaerobic as well as the aerobic pathogens."

Several risk factors for acquiring pneumonia in older age have been reported, such as alcoholism, lung and heart diseases, nursing home residence and swallowing disorders. The clinical characteristics of pneumonia in the elderly differ substantially compared with younger patients, and the severity of the disease is strongly associated with increased age and age-related comorbidities. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading pathogen responsible for pneumonia in elderly; enteric Gram-negative rods should be considered in nursing-home-acquired pneumonia, as well anaerobes in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Antimicrobial therapy should take into account the most recent guidelines, which are briefly presented in this review. A special consideration should be given to the preventive measures, including vaccination, oral care and nutrition."

","SPECIES:AnaerobesID:16600551TITLE:[Using antibiotics in case of influenza].ABSTRACT:Acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). Influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. The bacteria involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus. However, Gram-negative rods, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and methicillin resistant S. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. Various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. No data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics."

A 44-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a progressive pulmonary disease of 7-month duration characterized by hemoptysis and fever. For these complaints, based on the radiological picture, he had already received antituberculous therapy without any relief. He was also subjected to bronchial artery embolization prior to referral. Evaluation of the patient led to a diagnosis of chronic anaerobic pneumonitis. Anaerobic culture of the computed tomography-guided transthoracic aspirate grew Fusobacterium and Veillonella species. Within 2 weeks of therapy with oral clindamycin, there was a dramatic relief in hemoptysis. This was accompanied by remarkable radiological clearance. This report underscores the importance of Veillonella species as a potential respiratory pathogen. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose chronic anaerobic pneumonitis, which can mimic pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in tuberculosis endemic regions."

METHODS: From December 2001 to December 2006, 459 adult patients with a diagnosis of thoracic empyema in a tertiary hospital were screened for HATE. HATE was defined as a new pleural empyema which developed after 48 hours of hospitalization. RESULTS: In total, 56 adult (&gt;or=18 years) patients who were diagnosed with HATE were enrolled in our series, including 35 men (62.5%) and 21 women (37.5%), with ages ranging from 22 to 87 years old (mean = 59). Causes of HATE were classified into two categories: hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) related (n = 25) and non-HAP related (n = 31). Causes of non-HAP related empyema were comprised of catheter-related infections (n = 20), hepatobiliary tract infections (n = 6), septic emboli (n = 4), and postpneumonectomy (n = 1). Comparing the bacteriology between the two categories, HAP-related empyema had a significantly higher incidence of aerobic Gram-negative organisms (76% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.005), polymicrobial pathogens (40% vs. 9.7%, P = 0.008), and anaerobic pathogens (20% vs. 0%, P = 0.009) than non-HAP related empyema. However, there was no significant difference in mortality rate (60% vs. 52%, P = 0.52) between the two categories. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of antibiotic treatment for HATE should be based on the etiology of the pleural infection. In treating HAP-related empyema, antibiotics should cover aerobic Gram-negative, polymicrobial, and anaerobic pathogens."

","SPECIES:AnaerobesID:19857224TITLE:Aspiration pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Aspiration pneumonia is diagnosed upon confirmation of inflammatory findings in the lungs and overt aspiration (apparent aspiration) or a condition in which aspiration is strongly suspected (abnormal swallowing function and dysphagia). In hospital-acquired pneumonia, this occurs as one consequence of frequent silent aspiration. In the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, evaluation of the risk of silent aspiration during the night and evaluation of swallowing function are important. The causative microorganisms in aspiration pneumonia, similar to community-acquired pneumonia, are basically thought to be bacteria residing in the oral cavity, such as pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobes. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia often occurs with no distinction between apparent and silent aspiration, and in many cases, aspiration of foreign substances is serious when dysphagia itself is severe. In the treatment of aspiration pneumonia, use of antimicrobials for the pneumonia itself and early measures to prevent aspiration are important."

The aims of this study were to determine the positivity rate of BCs performed in patients with CAP, empirically started antibiotic regimens and conformity of the empirically started antibiotics with the results of BCs. METHODS: Patients with the diagnosis of CAP with started empiric antibiotic treatment and performed BC test were included in the study. The BC set consisting of aerobic/anaerobic bottles was obtained from a single draw. Co-morbidities of patients, empirically started antibiotics and BC results were noted. Empiric antibiotics were checked as to whether they conform to BC results. RESULTS: The study included 262 patients with CAP. Majority of BC sets (195) revealed no bacterial growth. Of the total 262 sets of BCs, 67 (25.6%) sets displayed growth of organism and only 30 sets (11.5%) represented significant isolates. Commonly isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus species. Ampicillin/Sulbactam and Fluoroquinolone combination was the leading antibiotic regimen chosen for the treatment (54.2%). The majority of patients had at least one co-morbidity. Ninety-six patients (37%) had a pulmonary disease, 74 (29%) had a malignancy, 74 (29%) had heart failure and 67 (26%) suffered from diabetes. CONCLUSION: Significantly positive results are rare (11.5%) and majority of blood cultures revealed negative results. BC tests may not be performed in all patients with CAP (Tab. 3, Ref. 11).

We retrospectively observed patients with HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who were hospitalized between December 2004 and March 2005, and compared their disease characteristics. A total of 34 patients (14 with HCAP and 20 with CAP) were evaluated. Of the patients with HCAP, seven (50%) were hospitalized for at least 2 days in the preceding 90 days and five (35.7%) resided in a nursing home or extended care facility. Compared with patients with CAP, patients with HCAP were older, had more complications, including central nerve diseases, had greater disease severity, but lower serum albumin level. More methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas spp., and anaerobes were isolated from patients with HCAP than from those with CAP. Conversely, more Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected and more penicillin was used in patients with CAP. This study provides additional evidence that HCAP should be distinguished from CAP and suggests the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategy for HCAP may be similar to those for hospital-acquired pneumonia."

The present study was carried out to know the prevalence of DAI in a tertiary care teaching hospital of rural Gujarat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, site-specific surveillance of three common DAIs that is catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), IV-catheter-related bloodstream infection (IV-CRBSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was carried out between July 2007 and April 2008, in different wards/ICUs. A surveillance plan, with guidelines and responsibilities of nurses, clinicians and microbiologist was prepared. Infection surveillance form for each patient suspected to have DAI was filled. The most representative clinical sample, depending on the type of suspected DAI, was collected using standard aseptic techniques and processed for aerobes and facultative anaerobes. All the isolates were identified and antimicrobial sensitivity testing performed as per CLSI guidelines. An accurate record of total device days for each of the indwelling devices under surveillance was also maintained. Data, collected in the prescribed formats, were analysed on monthly basis; and then, compiled at the end of the study. Descriptive analysis of the data was done and DAI rate was expressed as number of DAI per 1000 device days. RESULTS: The overall infection rate for CA-UTI, IV-CRBSI, and VAP were found to be 0.6, 0.48, and 21.92 per 1000 device days, respectively. The organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, CONS, Enterococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of indwelling devices was found to be the major risk-factor for acquiring DAIs. Low DAI rate might have been due to use of antibiotics, often prophylactic. Active surveillance is quite a tedious and time-consuming process; however the outcome is useful in prevention and control of DAIs."

We analysed 4,715 consecutive patients with community-acquired pneumonia from two acute care hospitals. Patients were classified into three groups: no pleural effusion, uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema/complicated parapneumonic effusion. A total of 882 (19%) patients had radiological evidence of pleural fluid, of whom 261 (30%) met criteria for empyema/complicated parapneumonic effusion. The most important event related to the presence of uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion was a longer hospital stay. Relevant clinical and microbiological consequences were associated with empyema/complicated parapneumonic effusion. Five independent baseline characteristics could predict the development of empyema/complicated parapneumonic effusion: age &lt; 60 yrs (p = 0.012), alcoholism (p = 0.002), pleuritic pain (p = 0.002), tachycardia &gt;100 beats min-1 (p = 0.006) and leukocytosis &gt;15,000 mm-3 (p &lt; 0.001). A higher incidence of anaerobes and Gram-positive cocci was found in this subgroup of patients. We conclude that only the development of empyema/complicated parapneumonic effusion carried relevant consequences; this condition should be suspected in the presence of some baseline characteristics and managed by using antimicrobials active against Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes."

There is limited evidence regarding the involvement of anaerobes in most cases of aspiration pneumonia. Most patients respond to treatment for aspiration pneumonia without specific anti-anaerobic therapy such as metronidazole. Metronidazole has adverse side effects, and widespread use where not indicated can promote carriage of multiresistant intestinal flora such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

We retrospectively investigated the clinical effects of the early treatment of aspiration pneumonia and background factors in 24 patients from whom Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. Sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was selected for early treatment in 12 of the 24 patients diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, and tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) was selected for the other patients. The effective rates and success rates of early treatment were significantly higher in the TAZ/PIPC group than in the SBT/ABPC group (p = 0.003 and 0.027, respectively). Although no significant difference was noted because of the limited number of cases, the survival rates after 30 days were 91.7 and 58.3 % in the TAZ/PIPC and SBT/ABPC groups, respectively. Several bacteria isolated with Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no anaerobe or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. Thirteen and 11 of the 24 cases were classified as healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), respectively, with no case classified as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). As population aging progresses, the frequency of aspiration pneumonia classified as HCAP will increase. To cover anaerobes, it is necessary to select antibacterial drugs, such as TAZ/PIPC, for early treatment in consideration of resistant gram-negative bacteria to improve the outcome, and not drugs with weak activity against these bacteria."

The pathogenesis of AP presumes the contribution of risk factors that alter swallowing function and predispose to the oropharyngeal bacterial colonization. The microbial etiology of AP involves Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae for community-acquired AP and Gram-negative aerobic bacilli in nosocomial pneumonia. It is worth bearing in mind the relative unimportance of anaerobic bacteria in AP.

The objective of this work was to determine the incidence of anaerobes in surgical ICU patients with suspected pneumonia. METHODS: This was a prospective observational, single-center study. Analysis was based on data collected over 30 months from the surgical ICU of a tertiary care hospital (Rouen University Hospital), including data on risk factors for anaerobes in the lungs. Patients with suspected pneumonia (community-acquired or nosocomial) were included. Bacteriological sampling was performed by protected distal bronchial sampling (PDBS) with minilavage under bronchoscopy. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed for each sample. Clinicians were only aware of aerobic results. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis compared groups with and without anaerobes. RESULTS: A total of 134 samples were obtained from 117 patients. Surgery was performed on 74 patients (63.2%), within 24 hours of admission. Fifty-four patients (46.2%) had a chest trauma and 20 patients (17.1%) were admitted for a digestive pathology. Average age was 53.6+-20.9 years and sex ratio was 5.9 (100 men/17 women). Average SAPS II was 41.6+-15.1, median length of ICU stay was 23 days (25th percentile=13, 75th percentile=33), and median duration of mechanical ventilation was 21 days (25th percentile=11, 75th percentile=28). Mortality rate in ICU was 14.5%. After sampling, diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed in 70 cases (52.2%). Anaerobe cultures were positive in 11 samples taken from 11 different patients (overall incidence 8.2%). Aerobic bacteria were also involved in 9 patients (81.8%). In univariate analysis, enteral feeding (P=0.02) and absence of catecholamines at time of sampling (P=0.003) were significantly associated with the presence of anaerobes in PDBS. Enteral nutrition was also found to be a risk factor in multivariate analysis (OR=11.8, 95% CI [1.36 to 102.4] P=0.025). Prior antianaerobic antibiotic treatment was not a protective factor. No difference was observed regarding the notion of aspiration, survival, total length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, or evolution of pneumonia between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the presence of anaerobic bacteria in the lung samples of patients from surgical ICU with an incidence comparable to that found in populations from medical ICU departments. Anaerobic morbidity in our study is in line with recent literature."

We characterized the presentation, management and outcomes of pneumonia in children with and without CCC and described how antibiotic management and outcomes vary among subgroups of children with CCC. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of children &lt;18 years with pneumonia across a large sample of US hospitals. Children were grouped according to CCC subgroups. Differences in disease management and outcomes were assessed using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of the 31,684 children in our cohort, 11.9% had CCC. Children with CCC were more likely to receive intensive investigations and therapies, were less likely to receive aminopenicillins or third generation cephalosporins and were more likely to receive antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes. Compared with children without these conditions, children with CCC had significantly increased length of stay [relative risk 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.48] and hospital costs (relative risk 1.38, 95% CI 1.33-1.43), with increased odds of antibiotic escalation (odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI 1.35-1.70), pneumonia complications (odds ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.24-1.75) and readmission (odds ratio 4.0, 95% CI 3.2-5.0). DISCUSSION: Children with CCC comprise a significant proportion of children hospitalized for pneumonia and are at substantially increased risk of adverse outcomes. They have high rates of treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, both at the time of hospitalization and subsequently. Research is needed to inform decision-making and guideline development, with goals of reducing adverse outcomes and unnecessary variation in management among children with CCC."

In recent years, this has been changing. Klebsiella pneumoniae is now an increasing cause of community- acquired lung abscess, but Streptococcus species continue to be major pathogens. Necrotizing pneumonia has generally been regarded as a rare complication of pneumococcal infection in adults. Type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most common type implicated in necrosis; however, many other serotypes were implicated. This entity predominately infects children, but is present also in adults. Lung abscess in adults due to Streptococcus pneumoniae is not common.

Finally, we aim to summarize current evidence surrounding the diagnosis, microbiology, treatment, risks, and prevention of aspiration pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline was searched from inception to November 2013. All descriptive or experimental studies that added to the understanding of aspiration pneumonia were reviewed. All studies that provided insight into the clinical aspiration syndromes, historical context, diagnosis, microbiology, risk factors, prevention, and treatment were summarized within the text. RESULTS: Despite the original teaching, aspiration pneumonia is difficult to distinguish from other pneumonia syndromes. The microbiology of pneumonia after a macroaspiration has changed over the last 60 years from an anaerobic infection to one of aerobic and nosocomial bacteria. Successful antibiotic therapy has been achieved with several antibiotics. Various risks for aspiration have been described leading to several proposed preventative measures. CONCLUSIONS: Aspiration pneumonia is a disease with a distinct pathophysiology. In the modern era, aspiration pneumonia is rarely solely an anaerobic infection. Antibiotic treatment is largely dependent on the clinical scenario. Several measures may help prevent aspiration pneumonia."

Our objective was to research the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in acute coma patients who were not pre-treated with antibiotics or hospitalized within 30 days prior to the event. We prospectively analyzed 127 patient records from adult patients admitted, intubated and ventilated to a tertiary medical intensive care unit with acute coma. Bacteriology and antibiotic resistance testing from tracheal aspirate sampled within 24 h after admission, blood cultures, ICU scores (APACHE II, SOFA), hematology, and clinical chemistry were assessed. Patients were followed up until death or hospital discharge. The majority of patients with acute coma suffered from acute cardiovascular disorders, predominantly myocardial infarction, followed by poisonings, and coma of unknown cause. In a majority of our patients, microaspiration resulted in overt infection. Most frequently S. aureus, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae were isolated. Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides spec., Fusobacteria, Prevotella spec.) were isolated from tracheal aspirate in a minority of patients, and predominantly as part of a mixed infection. Antibiotic monotherapy with a 2nd generation cephalosporin, or a 3rd generation gyrase inhibitor, was most effective in our patients regardless of the presence of anaerobic bacteria. "

Their incidence is constantly increasing. Although by definition they are considered to be a ""parapneumonic"" phenomenon, the microbial epidemiology of these effusions differs from pneumonia with a higher prevalence of anaerobic bacteria. The first thoracentesis is the most important diagnostic stage because it allows for a distinction between complicated and non-complicated parapneumonic effusions. Only complicated parapneumonic effusions need to be drained. Therapeutic evacuation modalities include repeated therapeutic thoracentesis, chest tube drainage or thoracic surgery. The choice of the first-line evacuation treatment is still controversial and there are few prospective controlled studies. The effectiveness of fibrinolytic agents is not established except when they are combined with DNase. Antibiotics are mandatory; they should be initiated as quickly as possible and should be active against anaerobic bacteria except for in the context of pneumococcal infections. There are few data on the use of chest physiotherapy, which remains widely used. Mortality is still high and is influenced by underlying comorbidities. "

Since the introduction of antibiotics, the morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome have been dramatically reduced. This syndrome is characterized by a pharyngeal infection, which leads to the development of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with septic emboli, which usually spread into the lung. Sometimes the syndrome can be revealed by other unusual clinical symptoms. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a young patient with an atypical pleural infection associated with pharyngeal infection and thrombosis from the internal jugular vein. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome is mainly clinical, based on a range of suggesting symptoms. Confirmation and monitoring of the condition can be done by ultra-sound and/or contrast enhanced computed tomography. Treatment is based on long-term, high-dose antibiotic therapy and eventually surgical drainage of the infected collection with surgical excision of the internal jugular vein where there is extensive thrombosis. The important message is that in the context of a young patient without comorbidity, who presents with a significant infectious pleurisy, it is important to consider this clinical complication."

","SPECIES:AnaerobesID:26344607TITLE:Update on the pathogenesis and management of pneumonia in the elderly-roles of aspiration pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Pneumonia in the elderly results in the highest mortality among cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The pathophysiology of pneumonia in the elderly is primarily due to aspiration pneumonia (ASP). ASP comprises two pathological conditions: airspace infiltration with bacterial pathogens and dysphagia-associated miss-swallowing. The first-line therapy for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia in the elderly is a narrow spectrum of antibiotics, including sulbactam/ampicillin, which are effective against major lower respiratory infection pathogens and anaerobes. The bacterial pathogens of ASP cases of pneumonia in the elderly are similar to those associated with adult CAP. In addition to an appropriate course of antibiotics, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches for dysphagia and upper airway management are necessary for the treatment and prevention of pneumonia. Swallowing rehabilitation, oral health care, pneumococcal vaccination, gastroesophageal reflux management, and a head-up position during the night are necessary for the treatment and prevention of repeated episodes of pneumonia in elderly patients. In addition, tuberculosis should always be considered for the differential diagnosis of pneumonia in this patient population. "

OBJECTIVES: This prospective observational study is an etiological survey of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) over a 12-month period in the Iranian city of Mashhad. To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective hospital-based studies to comprehensively evaluate the epidemiological, demographical, clinical, and prognostic factors of patients with CAP in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied all adult patients (aged &gt;= 16 years) with CAP admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, between February 2013 and January 2014. The etiological diagnosis of CAP was made through conventional culturing and staining of respiratory secretions (i.e. sputum and pleural fluid), standard BACTEC  Plus Aerobic/F bottles for blood cultures, and the immunochromatographic assays BinaxNOW( ) Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen and BinaxNOW( ) Legionella pneumophila antigen for the detection of S. pneumoniae antigen and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen, respectively. RESULTS: Among 120 patients with CAP, the most common etiology was S. pneumoniae (24.4%), followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (17.5%), S. aureus (6.7%), polymicrobial agents including anaerobes (4.2%), complicated hydatid cyst (2.5%), Influenza A virus (4.2%; including 2 cases of mixed Influenza A-bacterial infection), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Brucella melitensis, Mucor, and varicella, each in 0.8% of the patients. The diagnosis of pneumonia remained unknown in 49 (40%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis was an important cause of CAP in our region.

Anaerobes are important pathogens, however, the etiology of aspiration pneumonia is not fully understood. In addition, the relationship between the patient clinical characteristics and the causative pathogens in pneumonia patients with aspiration risk factors are unclear. To evaluate the relationship between the patient clinical characteristics with risk factors for aspiration and bacterial flora in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in pneumonia patients, the bacterial floral analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene was applied in addition to cultivation methods in BALF samples. METHODS: From April 2010 to February 2014, BALF samples were obtained from the affected lesions of pneumonia via bronchoscopy, and were evaluated by the bacterial floral analysis of 16S rRNA gene in addition to cultivation methods in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Factors associated with aspiration risks in these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 177 (CAP 83, HCAP 94) patients were enrolled. According to the results of the bacterial floral analysis, detection rate of oral streptococci as the most detected bacterial phylotypes in BALF was significantly higher in patients with aspiration risks (31.0 %) than in patients without aspiration risks (14.7 %) (P = 0.009). In addition, the percentages of oral streptococci in each BALF sample were significantly higher in patients with aspiration risks (26.6 +- 32.0 %) than in patients without aspiration risks (13.8 +- 25.3 %) (P = 0.002). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of &gt;=3, the presence of comorbidities, and a history of pneumonia within a previous year were significantly associated with a detection of oral streptococci in BALF. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial floral analysis of 16S rRNA gene revealed that oral streptococci were mostly detected as the most detected bacterial phylotypes in BALF samples in CAP and HCAP patients with aspiration risks, especially in those with a poor ECOG-PS or a history of pneumonia."

However, risk factors associated with hospital mortality in bacteremic pneumonia are inadequately described.The study was a retrospective cohort study, conducted in Barnes-Jewish Hospital (2008-2015). For purposes of this investigation, antibiotic susceptibility was determined according to ceftriaxone susceptibility, as ceftriaxone represents the antimicrobial agent most frequently recommended for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia as opposed to nosocomial pneumonia. Two multivariable analyses were planned: the first model included resistance to ceftriaxone as a variable, whereas the second model included the various antibiotic-resistant species (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae).In all, 1031 consecutive patients with bacteremic pneumonia (mortality 37.1%) were included. The most common pathogens associated with infection were S aureus (34.1%; methicillin resistance 54.0%), Enterobacteriaceae (28.0%), P aeruginosa (10.6%), anaerobic bacteria (7.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.6%). Compared with ceftriaxone-susceptible pathogens (46.8%), ceftriaxone-resistant pathogens (53.2%) were significantly more likely to receive inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment (IIAT) (27.9% vs 7.1%; P &lt; 0.001) and to die during hospitalization (41.5% vs 32.0%; P = 0.001). The first logistic regression analysis identified IIAT with the greatest odds ratio (OR) for mortality (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.2, P &lt; 0.001). Other independent predictors of mortality included age, mechanical ventilation, immune suppression, prior hospitalization, prior antibiotic administration, septic shock, comorbid conditions, and severity of illness. In the second multivariable analysis that included the antibiotic-resistant species, IIAT was still associated with excess mortality, and P aeruginosa infection was identified as an independent predictor of mortality (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2, P = 0.047), whereas infection with ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0, P = 0.050) was associated with lower mortality.More than one-third of our patients hospitalized with bacteremic pneumonia died. IIAT was identified as the most important risk factor for hospital mortality and the only risk factor amenable to potential intervention. Specific antibiotic-resistant pathogen species were also associated with mortality. "

Differentiation of tuberculous from non-tuberculous community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important challenge in endemic areas. The purpose of this study was the comparison between characteristics of tuberculous and non-tuberculous CAP patients. METHODS: In this prospective and observational study, all adult patients (aged &gt;=16 years) who were admitted to Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad (Iran) with the diagnosis of CAP, between February 2013 and January 2014, were enrolled. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data of the patients were collected and reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 14 software and R programming language. RESULTS: We studied 120 patients with diagnosis of acute CAP including 21 (17.5%) tuberculous and 99 (82.5%) non-tuberculous CAP. The etiologies of CAP in the latter group were as follow: S. pneumoniae 29 (29.3%), followed by S. aureus, polymicrobial including anaerobes, and other agents. The diagnosis of pneumonia remained unknown in 49 (40%) patients. We found approximately equal gender distribution among two study groups (14/21 vs. 61/99, 63.6% vs. 62.9%, p=0.948). Fifty percent of patients with tuberculous CAP had opioid addiction that was more frequent compared with non-tuberculous group (p=0.240). 52.4%, 63.2%, 30%, and 90% of patients with tuberculous CAP had severe presentation based on PSI, IDSA/ATS, CURB-65, and SMART-COP, respectively.

When aspiration is suspected, antibiotics to cover anaerobes are frequently used, but in the absence of clear risk factors, current guidelines have questioned their role. It is unknown how frequently these guidelines are followed. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre observational study on practice patterns of anaerobic antibiotic use in consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia (Asp), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were studied (Asp: 20, HCAP: 107, CAP: 65). Overall, 59 patients received anaerobic antibiotics (Asp: 90%, HCAP: 28%, CAP 17%) but a significant proportion of these patients did not meet criteria to receive them. Inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use was 12/20 for Asp, 27/107 for HCAP and 9/65 for CAP. Mortality probability model III at zero hours (MPM0) score and a diagnosis of Asp were predictors of receiving inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics. Receiving inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics was associated with a longer ICU length of stay (LOS; 7 days (interquartile range (IQR): 7-21) vs 4 days (IQR:2-9), P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: For patients in the ICU admitted with pneumonia, there is a high occurrence of inappropriately prescribed anaerobic antibiotics, the use of which was associated with a longer ICU LOS."

","SPECIES:AnaerobesID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

All patients diagnosed with empyema preoperatively and had either a video-assisted thoracoscopic or open decortication surgery from January 2010 to September 2015 were reviewed. Forty-seven patients were identified with a mean age of 54.7 +- 16.8 years (X +- SD). Sixty per cent of patients had CAP. Anaerobes were the most common isolate at 21 per cent, followed by Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus (50% Methicillin Resistant). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were the next most frequent at 13 per cent. Hospital-acquired pneumonia patients had a higher incidence of S. aureus infections (P = 0.047). Cancer history had higher rates of both fungal (P = 0.004) and gram-negative infections (P = 0.03). Older patients had increased incidence of gram-negative infections (P = 0.05).

Materials and methods: EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for studies that examined the clinical efficacy of antibiotic treatment in elderly patients with aspiration pneumonia. Information on study design, antibiotic treatment, study population, participants, microbiology, clinical outcomes, adverse events, and mortality was recorded. Results: There were no definitive clinical trials, placebo-controlled trials, or meta-analyses. Of the eight studies selected for inclusion in the review, the majority utilized and/or compared broad-spectrum antibiotics. No specific antibacterial agent had evidence of superior efficacy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics resulted in the emergence of multiresistant organisms. Anaerobic bacteria were infrequently isolated, suggesting a less important role in the pathogenesis of aspiration pneumonia. Conclusion: There is limited evidence with regard to the use of antibiotics in older patients with aspiration pneumonia.

We summarize diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and strategies for prevention of aspiration. RECENT FINDINGS: Aspiration is present in normal individuals, and disease manifestation depends on the chemical characteristics, frequency, and volume of inoculum. Anaerobes, though present, are no longer the predominant microbes isolated in aspiration pneumonia. Targets for preventing aspiration including improved oral hygiene and positional feeding have had mixed results. Patients diagnosed by clinicians with aspiration pneumonia experience greater morbidity and mortality than patients with community-acquired pneumonia. SUMMARY: Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis are part of the pneumonia continuum and share similarities in pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment. Modern microbiology demonstrates that the lung is not sterile, and isolates in aspiration pneumonia frequently include aerobes or mixed cultures. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia should include antibiotic coverage for oral anaerobes, aerobes associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and resistant organisms depending on appropriate clinical context. Additional studies targeting prevention of aspiration and investigating the increased morbidity and mortality associated with aspiration pneumonia are warranted."

While there are not universally agreed upon criteria, the diagnosis can be made in patients with the appropriate risk factors and clinical scenario, in addition to a radiographic or an ultrasonographic image of pneumonia in the typical dependent lung segment. Treatment options for aspiration pneumonia vary based on the site of acquisition (community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [CAAP] versus healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia [HCAAP]), the risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and severity of illness. Hospitalized CAAP patients without severe illness and with no risk for MDR organisms or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) can be treated with standard inpatient community-acquired pneumonia therapy covering anaerobes. Patients with CAAP and either of the following-risk factors for MDR pathogens, septic shock, need for an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation-can be considered for broader coverage against anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and PA. Severe aspiration pneumonia that originates in a long-term care facility or HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms should be considered for similar treatment. HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms or PA, plus septic shock, need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation should receive double coverage for PA in addition to coverage for MRSA and anaerobes. Multiple gaps in current understanding and management of aspiration pneumonia require future research, with a particular focus on antibiotic stewardship."

","SPECIES:AnaerobesID:31292363TITLE:[Microbiology of Aspiration Pneumonia].ABSTRACT:The number of patients with pneumonia has been increasing as the population ages, and most fatal pneumonia cases are the elderly with aspiration pneumonia. Although aspiration pneumonia leads to poor short- and long-term prognosis, there have been no practical ways to diagnose it precisely. Persistent subclinical aspiration without any subjective symptoms is problematic in clinical practice in patients with aspiration pneumonia, and physicians can only use aspiration risks such as brain infarction to diagnose aspiration pneumonia. Anaerobes have been believed to be major causative pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, based on data from the 1970's. In relation to these data, Marik insisted that there is a possible overestimation of anaerobes because 1) the sampling of microbiologic specimens was in the late phase in the course of the illness, especially frequently after developing complications such as abscesses, necrotizing pneumonia, or empyema thoracis; 2) the organisms recovered by percutaneous transtracheal aspiration (PTA) sampling could have been contaminated by the aspiration of oropharyngeal flora during the PTA procedure or colonized in the trachea; and 3) many of the patients had chronic alcoholism or were under general anesthesia. In addition, 4) oral care was not common in the 1970s, and 5) the patients in these reports were relatively young. Molecular biological approaches using the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene have recently been used, and have enabled us to detect more exact pathogens compared to conventional bacterial culture. Using the method with the detection of the 16S rRNA gene, we evaluated the bacterial phylotypes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with aspiration pneumonia and found that oral streptococci were the most detected phylotypes (31.0%), while anaerobes were only 6.0%. Our results suggest that oral streptococci are important, and anaerobes may have been overestimated as causative pathogens in patients with aspiration pneumonia."

While studies have revealed significant progress in identifying risk factors for aspiration pneumonia, the clinical presentation and diagnosis remains challenging to healthcare providers. Areas Covered: We conducted a broad literature review using the MeSH heading in PubMed/MEDLINE of ""aspiration pneumonia"" from January 1970 to July 2019. The understanding of the microbiology of aspiration pneumonia has evolved from a possible shift in the causative organisms away from anaerobes to traditional community-acquired pneumonia organisms. The importance of this shift is not yet known, but it has questioned the pathogenic role of anaerobes, appropriate anaerobic testing and the role of these pathogens in the pulmonary microbiome in patients with pneumonia. The identification of risk factors led to strategies to prevent or minimize the risk of aspiration pneumonia with moderate success. Expert Opinion: Our expert opinion is that further research is needed to determine the role of the microbiome with aspiration pneumonia and patient risk factors. There is also a great need to develop clinical tools to help providers diagnose, treat, and prevent aspiration pneumonia."

Pneumonia or pleural empyema is the most common metastatic infection in Lemierre's syndrome. Antimicrobial therapy should be prescribed for 3-6 weeks. The treatment regimens include metronidazole and beta-lactam antibiotics. In recent years, the antibiotic stewardship program has resulted in decreased antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory tract infections. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome has increased over the past decade. F. necrophorum is an underestimated cause of acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

We describe an uncommon case of necrotising fasciitis caused by Finegoldia magna, an anaerobic coccus, in a 40-year-old patient with diabetes. F. magna is a Gram-positive anaerobic coccus, which was previously known as Peptostreptococcus magnus The bacteria is found in the normal flora of the urogenital tract. The bacteria is associated with severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, paravalvular abscess around a bioprosthetic valve, purulent pericarditis complicated by mediastanitis, meningitis after pneumonia and necrotising pneumonia complicated by pyopneumothorax. There have been no cases in the literature describing necrotising fasciitis of the abdominal wall caused by F. magna."

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the aspiration risk factors, microbiology patterns, and empiric anti-anaerobic use in patients hospitalized with CAP? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of GLIMP, an international, multicenter, point-prevalence study of adults hospitalized with CAP. Patients were stratified into three groups: 1) ACAP, 2) CAP/AspRF+ (CAP with AspRF) and 3) CAP/AspRF- (CAP without AspRF). Data on demographics, comorbidities, microbiological results, and anti-anaerobic antibiotics were analyzed in all groups. Patients were further stratified in severe and non-severe CAP groups. RESULTS: We enrolled 2,606 patients with CAP, of which 193 (7.4%) had ACAP. Risk factors independently associated with ACAP were male, bedridden, underweight, a nursing home resident, and having a history of stroke, dementia, mental illness, and enteral tube feeding. Among non-ACAP patients, 1,709 (70.8%) had CAP/AspRF+ and 704 (29.2%) had CAP/AspRF-. Microbiology patterns including anaerobes were similar between CAP/AspRF-, CAP/AspRF+ and ACAP (0.0% vs. 1.03% vs. 1.64%). Patients with severe ACAP had higher rates of total Gram-negative bacteria (64.3% vs. 44.3% vs. 33.3%, p=0.021) and lower rates of total Gram-positive bacteria (7.1% vs. 38.1% vs. 50.0%, p<0.001) when compared to patients with severe CAP/AspRF+ and severe CAP/AspRF-, respectively. The majority of the patients (>50% in all groups) independent of AspRFs or ACAP received specific or broad-spectrum anti-anaerobic coverage antibiotics. INTERPRETATION: Hospitalized patients with ACAP or CAP/AspRF+ had similar anaerobic flora compared to patients without aspiration risk factors. Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent in patients with severe ACAP. Despite having similar microbiological flora between groups, a large proportion of CAP patients received anti-anaerobic antibiotic coverage."

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen of the respiratory tract causing pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis or pneumonia. Neurological complications are the most frequent extrapulmonary manifestation. So far, only a few case reports suggested an association between cranial nerve palsy and M. pneumoniae infection. Patients with a BP who were admitted to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology or Neurology of the University of Wuerzburg between 2000 and 2002 were tested serologically for the presence of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, herpes viruses (HSV-1/2, VZV) and M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis of mycoplasmal infection was made when at least one of the following criteria was met: a threefold rise or more in the titer of antibody of M. pneumoniae in paired sample or a microparticle agglutination assay (MAG) of &gt; or =1:40 and the detection of IgA and/or IgM antibodies in the acute phase serum. Ninety-one consecutive patients could be included. Fifteen patients showed a reactivation of a VZV ( n=12) or of a HSV-1 ( n=3) infection. In six cases the immunoblot revealed specific antibody bands for B. burgdorferi. In 24 patients (26.4%) a seroconversion of M. pneumoniae could be detected. Only two patients complained of mild respiratory symptoms. According to our results, M. pneumoniae is frequently associated with Bell's palsy. Thus, a routine screening for this pathogen, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms, is necessary."

The course of the disease is usually mild, but in some cases, especially in extrapulmonary localisation, it can pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic problems. The aim of this study was evaluation of extrapulmonary manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 21 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection hospitalised in the III Pediatric Clinic, ICZMP in Lodz, between 2001 and 2002 three children with extrapulmonary manifestations of the disease were qualified for the study. The diagnosis was based on a test (from Biotest company) detecting specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies. RESULTS: In the analysed cases the manifestations of the disease were as follows: exudative gonitis (I), pain in the hip and knee joints (II) and abducens nerve paresis (III). In I case: IgM 1/250; 1/350, IgG- &gt; 1/1000, 1/350; IgA 1/100, negative; in II case: IgM &gt; 1/1000, IgG &gt; 1/1000, IgA negative. In III case IgM 1/450, 1/130; IgG &gt; 1/1000, &gt; 1/1000, IgA 1/300, 1/130. In all the children there were no symptoms form the respiratory tract. In both articular forms, the disease was preceded by Borrelia burgdorferi infection localised in the same joints. Only in case of exudative gonitis an increase in the inflammatory process indexes was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be considered also in case of extrapulmonary symptoms, with no coexisting infection in the respiratory tract. The forms of extrapulmonary manifestations, in particular concerning the joints and the nervous system, require prolonged and specific antibiotic treatment. Articular manifestation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection preceded by articular form of Borrelia burgdorferi infection is noteworthy, and may be caused by abnormal response form the immunological system."

The properdin-deficient index patient died from a fulminant infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y. Family investigation revealed properdin deficiency in the patient's half-brother and in the maternal grandfather. The half-brother had a history of pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis probably caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Opsonic and bactericidal functions of serum were examined in the half-brother after immunization with tetravalent meningococcal vaccine. Vaccination promoted opsonization of N. meningitidis serogroups C and Y but not of serogroups A and W-135. The serum bactericidal activity increased against serogroup C and to some extent against serogroup W-135. This report emphasizes the importance of investigating the complement system even in families with single cases of fulminant meningococcal disease. Individuals with properdin deficiency might be protected from infection by immunization.

Significantly more patients than controls had IgM antibodies by ELISA to varicella zoster virus (56.5% vs. 20%, P = 0.0001) and herpes simplex virus (41.9% vs. 18%, P = 0.006). Additionally, significantly more patients than controls were positive for CF antibody to varicella zoster virus (14.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.004) but not to herpes simplex or cytomegalovirus. Significantly more controls than patients (54% vs. 25.8%, P = 0.002) had no evidence of antigenic stimulation by any of the herpesvirus group. No significant difference between patients and controls in seropositivity by IgM ELISA to cytomegalovirus. Epstein-Barr virus and IFA for human herpes virus 6 was found. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups as to evidence of recent infection by the following agents: rubella virus and Borrelia burgdorferi by IgM ELISA, influenza A. influenza B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, mumps and measles. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii and chlamydia spp. by complement fixation test. The first reported case of clinically and serologically proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia associated with Bell's palsy is described.

His temperature was 37.4 degrees C and a circular pale erythema was noted over the left lower leg. INVESTIGATIONS: C-reactive protein was raised to 120 mg/l, white blood cell count was 5860/microliter, CD4-lymphocyte count 250/microliter. The chest radiogram showed pneumonitic infiltration in the left lower lobe. There were IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Left lower lobe pneumonia and chronic erythema migrans were diagnosed and he was given oral azithromycin (500 mg on the first day and 250 mg for 4 days). The pneumonia cleared up, but 2 weeks later he developed symptoms of meningitis (496 cells per microliter, 87% lymphocytes, positive Borrelia burgdorferi antibody titer), which quickly and lastingly responded to ceftriaxon (2 g daily by brief infusion for 14 days). CONCLUSION: This immune-compromised HIV-infected patient developed disseminated borreliosis with CNS involvement 2 weeks after the occurrence of chronic erythema migrans. The initial treatment of the latter with azithromycin was unable to prevent the meningitis. It is unlikely that there was a causal connection between the borreliosis and the pneumonia."

Laboratory data revealed marked inflammatory changes and severe liver injury. Blood culture disclosed Campylobacter fetus and two dimensional echocardiography showed a large vegetation on the anterior tricuspid valve. He was diagnosed as isolated tricuspid infective endocarditis accompanied with acute hepatitis due to drug abuse. Moreover pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy showed decreased perfusion in the right lower lung field, which suggested that pneumonia of six months ago was due to septic pulmonary emboli from the infected tricuspid valve.

Development of GBS is in 2/3 of cases preceded by acute infection, typically with gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms. Infectious agents related to GBS include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Molecular mimicry seems to be responsible for GBS development after infection, through the synthesis of autoantibodies against myelin gangliosides. Autoimmune reactions develop only in a small fraction of all exposed individuals, depending on still unresolved factors. Different infections lead to forms of GBS differing in spectrum of autoantibodies and in frequency with which different clinical symptoms appear. This may be of some significance for early prognosis and in future possibly for choosing therapeutic options. An increased risk of GBS may be also related to vaccination, but with presently used vaccines this increase remains below one case of GBS per one million doses."

The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It is generally accepted that corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are not recommended in patients with GBS including AMAN. However, if systemic autoimmune reaction developed, the principle of management might be changed. CASE REPORT: We report a young man who rapidly developed acute motor axonal neuropathy. Although plasma exchange had been given, the violent immunological reaction was unable to be controlled, prolonged leukemoid reaction and high level of autoimmunological titers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (Rf), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) persisted. Consequently, two months later, this patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and type 3 of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with rapid decline of renal function until immunosuppressants were given. CONCLUSION: AMAN combined with the violent systemic autoimmune reaction strongly indicated an uneven disease course and implied that only standard plasmapheresis is not sufficient and corticosteroids with immunosuppressant should be added in early stage."

It first appeared in 1976 and its cause was identified in 1977, the same year that Ebola fever, Hantaan virus and Campylobacter jejuni arrived. The designation of Legionnaires' disease as an EID was retrospective; it was not and could not be otherwise as the category only gained currency in the early 1990s. In this article we reflect on the changing medical understanding and social profile of Legionnaires' disease in the decade or so from its recognition to the creation of EIDs, especially its ambivalent position between public health and clinical medicine. However, we question any simple opposition, between public health experts who approached Legionnaires' disease as a new and worrying environmental threat that could be prevented, and clinicians who saw it as another cause of pneumonia that could be managed by improved diagnosis and treatment. We argue that in the British context of public spending cuts and the reform of public health, the category of 'new' diseases, in which Legionnaires' disease was central, was mobilised ahead of the EID lobby of the early 1990s, by interested groups in medicine to defend infectious diseases services."

There are not many papers elucidating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in such patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence of gastrointestinal disorders and IBD compared to respiratory tract infections in XLA individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of 1563 patients with primary immunodeficiencies diagnosed in the Department of Immunology, the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), 66 boys had a provisional diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia. Forty-four subjects fulfilled definitive ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiencies) diagnostic criteria of XLA. A retrospective analysis of medical history of XLA patients was undertaken. RESULTS: Recurrent respiratory tract infections, particularly bronchitis (73%) and pneumonia (59%), were the most common symptoms of XLA. The GI disorders constituted the next main manifestation (63.6%), followed by upper respiratory tract infections. Twenty-six of 28 XLA patients with GI disorders complained of diarrhea, which was resolved generally after immunoglobulin therapy introduction. Single but prolonged episodes of Campylobacter jejuni diarrhea were reported in two individuals. Inflammatory bowel disease of mild to moderate activity was diagnosed in 1 patient, and local enteritis of mild activity in another one. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal disorders were one of the main manifestations of XLA, reported almost as often as lower respiratory tract infections. The most common GI symptom was diarrhea, which usually resolved after immunoglobulin therapy was started. Infections caused by Giardia lamblia were reported occasionally. Inflammatory bowel disease was diagnosed quite exceptionally, which presumably may be connected with normal T cell immunity."

Among 83 patients who underwent stem cell transplantation, four developed IIP. We elucidated various parameters and clinical features in four patients with IIP and 79 patients without, after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In all four patients, (1) the conditioning regimen induced total body irradiation, (2) serological reactivation of cytomegalovirus and/or human herpesvirus-6 preceded the onset of IIP, (3) their human leucocyte antigen types were among those suspected to increase susceptibility to angiitis syndrome, (4) serum anti-H. pylori antibody was positive before conditioning and remained positive throughout the post-transplantation course, (5) inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, 8 and 12) were increased during the period of leucocyte recovery after transplantation and (6) the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, thrombomodulin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were increased at the onset of IIP.

There was a statistically significant difference for Mycoplasma IgM (p = 0.031) and Chlamidia IgM (p = 0.03) between group1 and other two groups. We have not found significant difference for M. pneumoniae IgG, C. pneumoniae IgG and H. pylori IgM and IgG among groups. CONCLUSION: M. Pneumoniae and C. Pneumoniae may play a role in development of asthma exacerbations in childhood. We could not find a relationship between H. Pylori and asthma."

METHODS: Forty patients with preeclampsia and 40 normotensive pregnant women of similar age and body mass index at the third trimester of gestation were selected for the study. Chlamydia pneumonia IgM and IgGs, Helicobacter pylori IgAs and concentrations of CRP and TNF-alpha were measured. RESULTS: Concentrations of CRP and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia than in control subjects. In the preeclamptic group, positivity rate for Helicobacter pylori IgA was significantly higher as compared to controls (p = 0.034). CRP and TNF-alpha levels were higher in Helicobacter pylori seropositive subjects. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated high levels of serum CRP and TNF-alpha in preeclamptic women who were seropositive to Helicobacter pylori in comparison with those in seronegative subjects."

She was diagnosed with pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (p-MALToma) based on results of a pathologic examination and the gene rearrangements in the Ig heavy chain on Southern blot hybridization. Although p-MALToma did not regress with conventional therapy, it was reduced after long-term treatment with clarithromycin (CAM) (200 mg/d). A 57-year-old woman with a history of Sjogren syndrome and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia had a mass lesion in the left lower lung field. CT image-guided biopsy established a diagnosis of p-MALToma. The p-MALToma regressed with long-term treatment with CAM (200 mg/d), whereas Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication therapy was not effective in concurrent atrophic gastritis with HP. It is suggested that CAM, a macrolide antibiotic, may be effective in some patients with p-MALToma."

A meta-analysis.ABSTRACT:This study was presented at the American College of Chest Physicians meeting in Pittsburgh (PA, USA) in October 2011. The study objective was to evaluate the association of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The design was a meta-analysis of nine case-controlled and cohort studies. 120,863 pneumonia cases from 1987 to 2006 were included in the meta-analysis. PubMed and Ovid Medline were searched from inception through May 2011 by two investigators independently using keywords: PPI, pneumonia, CAP, anti-ulcer, antacid, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole. This meta-analysis only included case-controlled and cohort studies that were published in full in English and evaluated PPI use and CAP incidence. Studies were excluded if they included the following patients: pediatric, Helicobacter pylori treatment and critically ill. Bibliographies of recent review articles and systematic reviews were hand-searched. Quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Two investigators independently extracted data into standardized data collection forms that were confirmed by a third investigator. Data were analyzed based on current use of PPIs, duration of PPI use (&lt;30 days or &gt;180 days) and PPI dose (high vs low). Overall association of PPI and CAP was analyzed using the random effects model (Comprehensive Meta analysis( ) Version 2.0). Nine studies met all criteria for the primary outcome. Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale scores ranged from 4 to 8 out of 9. Current use of PPIs (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.76), PPI use &lt;30 days (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.25-2.19), PPI high dose (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.33-1.68) and PPI low dose (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.11-1.24) were significantly associated with CAP. There was no association between CAP and PPI use &gt;180 days (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.00-1.21). In conclusion, patients currently receiving PPIs, particularly &lt;30 days or high dose, showed an association with CAP. Practitioners need to be vigilant about adverse effects of PPIs and consider alternative therapies."

Although rare, BOOP due to gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been reported in adults but not to date in pediatric patients. This study describes 2 pediatric patients who developed GER and BOOP. One patient had superior mesenteric artery syndrome and Helicobacter pylori infection, and the other had a gastroduodenal ulcer with reflux esophagitis. Respiratory symptoms occurred concurrently or after gastrointestinal symptoms. Monitoring of esophageal pH for 24 hours revealed pathologic acid reflux. Lung biopsy findings confirmed BOOP. No other causes of BOOP were observed in these 2 patients. Both patients were cured with antireflux therapy and corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to implicate GER as a reversible cause of BOOP in children. "

METHODS: We performed a prospective study in Mansoura University Hospitals, Egypt, for detecting H. pylori infection by estimating H. pylori IgG and IgM, in addition to detection of Chlamydiae infections by PCR in 90 pregnant women with PE and 90 normotensive pregnant women of the same age and body mass index who were studied as control. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in preeclamptic pregnant women was 54.4% with a statistically significant association to PE. The prevalence of C. pneumonia was 27.8% whereas that of C. trachomatis was 4.44%. The infected preeclamptic cases showed high levels of leucocytes besides elevated C-reactive protein concentrations. CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori was found to act as a cofactor in the development of PE. Occurrence of C. trachomatis was low in pregnant women in our community; however, it showed that it may act as a cofactor in PE, whereas C. pneumoniae was attributed to have no role in PE pathogenesis until supported by further studies."

Case series and retrospective analysis published in the literature have suggested that extra gastrointestinal (GI) MALT-type lymphoma can occur simultaneously with MALT-type lymphoma involving the GI tract. We report the case of a healthy, 64-year-old Caucasian male who presented with progressive fatigue, non-productive cough, and worsening exertional shortness of breath for 3 months who was subsequently diagnosed with gastric extra-nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma or MALToma with simultaneous metastasis to the lung (bronchi) based on biopsy reports. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency room complaining of progressive fatigue for 3 months which had progressed to the point of hindering his usual activities of daily living (ADL). He had recently visited his primary care provider for evaluation of a non-productive cough and exertional shortness of breath. A chest radiography obtained at the time showed bilateral infiltrates. He was then treated for atypical pneumonia but his symptoms unfortunately did not improve. Initial investigations in the emergency room revealed severe anemia and a positive stool guaiac test. Imaging showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and an irregular gastric mass. Gastric and transbronchial biopsies were suggestive of extra-nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma with simultaneous metastasis to the bronchi. He was treated symptomatically with transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and intravenous iron followed by radiotherapy. Helicobacter pylori infection was ruled out eliminating the possibility of treating him with eradication therapy. CONCLUSION: Although the stomach is the most common and most extensively studied site of involvement of MALT lymphomas, they can also emerge in many other locations. MALT lymphomas have a high tendency to disseminate to other sites; therefore, extensive staging may be necessary to look for suspicious lesions."

Recently, the role of gastric bacterial colonization has been proposed. The role of gastric colonization with Helicobacter pylori in pathogenesis of VAP was determined by comparing the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with VAP and control participants. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighteen mechanically ventilated patients were divided into two groups; 59 participants with VAP and 59 without VAP. Serologic tests for H. pylori were registered. Results: Mean age in seropositive patients was significantly higher. About 71.2% in VAP group and 61.01% in controls were IgG seropositive (P = 0.24). IgM seropositivity was 23.73% versus 8.47% in VAPs and controls, respectively (P = 0.024). By increasing the time of intubation, more patients became seropositive for IgM (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.4, P = 0.002). Conclusion: IgM seropositivity and serum levels were significantly higher in VAP patients. Furthermore, by increasing the duration of intubation, serum levels for IgM increased significantly."

Material and methods: An electronic search was performed using related keywords in the national and international databases up to June 30, 2017. Out of the 1807 articles found on the associations between bacterial infections and CVD, 20 relevant studies were selected for the meta-analysis. Results: The prevalence of bacterial infections was higher in case groups compared with the control groups. Odds ratios for assessing the association between Chlamydia pneumonia infection and CVD based on PCR, IgG and IgA tests were 7.420 (95% CI: 3.088-17.827), 3.710 (95% CI: 1.361-10.115) and 2.492 (95% CI: 1.305-4.756), respectively. Moreover, the calculated odds ratio for Mycoplasma pneumonia infection was 1.815 (95% CI: 0.973-3.386). For Helicobacter pylori infection, odds ratios based on IgG and IgA tests were 3.160 (95% CI: 1.957-5.102) and 0.643 (95% CI: 0.414-0.999), respectively. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis suggested that there was a significant association between H. pylori, C. pneumonia and M. pneumonia infections and CVD in Iran.

We present a patient, a 62-year-old female, who first presented with disease manifestation of acute hepatitis from hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, which was subsequently complicated by recurrent hospitalizations for recurrent pneumonia and concomitant Helicobacter pylori and cytomegalovirus enteritis. She was later found to have thymoma and hypogammaglobulinemia and was diagnosed with GS. Although the well-known importance of T cell is in directing B-cell responses in the immunopathology of thymoma, low levels of natural killer and CD4+ gammadelta T cells may also be the cause of both low immune surveillance of tumor development and weak clearance of viral infection. Hence, the temporal sequence of opportunistic infections following HBV reactivation and thymoma discovery may reflect a loss of immune surveillance as the first manifestation of PID."

ANIMALS: Twenty-seven 8-week-old female Beagles. PROCEDURE: Dogs were randomly assigned to challenge or control groups. Challenge groups were conjunctivally inoculated on 3 successive days with 5 x 10(7) L interrogans serovar pomona (n = 12) or serovar bratislava (11). Clinical signs were recorded throughout the experiment, and clinical pathology assays, bacteriologic culture, and necropsies (6 or 7 dogs necropsied at each time point) were done on postinoculation day (PID) 7, 10, 14, and 20. RESULTS: Infection could not be confirmed in any serovar bratislava-inoculated dog, and control dogs remained healthy throughout the experiment. Positive culture and fluorescent antibody test results were confirmed in 11 of 12 serovar pomona-inoculated dogs. Fever and lethargy starting at PID 7 were the most common clinical signs in serovar pomona-infected dogs. On day 10, gross lesions included multifocal renal and pulmonary hemorrhage and perirenal edema. Serovar pomona-inoculated dogs had histopathologic lesions including hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and pneumonia at PID 7, 10, 14, and 20.

The infection has a broad range of effects, from mild clinical manifestation to multiple organ failure, and ultimately death. A 5-months-old male unvaccinated dog was admitted to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital presenting dullness, dehydration, jaundiced mucous, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and hyporexia. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) detected serological titers of 1:1.600 for serogroup Canicola. After five days of monitoring by the medical team he developed fever and swelling of carpal and tarsal joints, accompanied by functional limitation. Initial antimicrobial treatment was instituted for leptospirosis. Polyarthritis responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy was observed through decreasing signs of inflammation of the affected joints. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was further confirmed by molecular investigation for Leptospira spp. on blood and synovial fluid samples. Amplification and sequencing of the secY partial gene characterized the infective bacterial as Leptospira interrogans.

The data for analysis were obtained via the hospital computer data base and via the medical files of the department of neurology. During the 5-year study period (1986-1990) 2378 adult patients were admitted and 1247 (52.4%) of them were screened. In seven (0.56%) patients both tests were positive. Three of them had been treated for syphilis in the past and showed no symptoms of active syphilis. Four (0.32%) patients suffered from active neurosyphilis. In three of these four patients syphilis was suspected on admission and confirmed by the tests. In one patient the diagnosis of syphilis was not considered. The positive test results became available shortly before she died of pneumonia and were without consequences. None of the 32 (2.6%) patients with a positive TPHA and a negative VDRL was diagnosed as having (neuro-)syphilis. Two (0.16%) patients had a false-positive VDRL. We conclude that routine serological examination for syphilis of every patient admitted to a neurological ward is not useful. We advise a limited screening of patients who belong to a group with high risk for syphilis and patients with symptoms and signs that can be caused by syphilis, such as dementia or ischaemic strokes at a relatively young age."

Laboratory studies reflected both this lifestyle and the probable underlying cause of the Kaposi's sarcoma and P. carinii pneumonia--cellular immune deficiency. Patients were found to have lymphopenia, specifically a deficiency of the T-helper subpopulation, resulting in a reversal of the T-helper to T-suppressor ratio. Levels of IgG and IgA were increased.

Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid was diagnostic of syphilis, not only by the characteristic cytomorphology but also by demonstration of spirochetes by the May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) and Steiner staining methods. This suggests that the pneumonia was also syphilitic. The patient was seropositive for HIV-I, but this probably did not contribute to the thoracic manifestations of syphilis, as there was no evidence of immunodeficiency by the CD4/CD8 T lymphocyte count. This is the second reported demonstration of Treponema pallidum in a pleural fluid, and the first diagnosed by cytopathologic examination."

","SPECIES:Vibrio choleraeID:25602257TITLE:Clinical manifestations of non-O1 Vibrio cholerae infections.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Infections caused by non-O1 Vibrio cholera are uncommon. The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections. METHODS: The clinical charts of all patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections and who were treated in two hospitals in Taiwan were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: From July 2009 to June 2014, a total of 83 patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections were identified based on the databank of the bacteriology laboratories of two hospitals. The overall mean age was 53.3 years, and men comprised 53 (63.9%) of the patients. Liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus were the two most common underlying diseases, followed by malignancy. The most common type of infection was acute gastroenteritis (n = 45, 54.2%), followed by biliary tract infection (n = 12, 14.5%) and primary bacteremia (n = 11, 13.3%). Other types of infection, such as peritonitis (n = 5, 6.0%), skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) (n = 5, 6.0%), urinary tract infection (n = 3, 3.6%) and pneumonia (2, 2.4%), were rare. July and June were the most common months of occurrence of V. cholera infections. The overall in-hospital mortality of 83 patients with V. cholera infections was 7.2%, but it was significantly higher for patients with primary bacteremia, hemorrhage bullae, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, or admission to an ICU. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with acute respiratory failure (odds ratio, 60.47; 95% CI, 4.79-763.90, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Non-O1 V. cholera infections can cause protean disease, especially in patients with risk factors and during warm-weather months. The overall mortality of 83 patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections was only 7.2%; however, this value varied among different types of infection."

Children under 5 years comprised 74% of the patients. Diarrhoeal pathogens were identified as Shigella spp. in 27%, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 17%, Entamoeba histolytica in 16%, Campylobacter jejuni in 12%, Salmonella spp. in 4%, Vibrio cholerae in 4%, and Giardia lambliain 4% of cases. The most frequent underlying causes of death were colitis in 44% and pneumonia in 38%. The most frequent immediate causes of death were septicaemia in 27%, hypoglycaemia in 9%, and hypokalaemia in 9%; multiple causes of death were present in 89% of cases. Kwashiorkor or marasmus was present in 59% and fatty degeneration of the liver was detected in 61% of cases. It is concluded that, in susceptible children, diarrhoeal pathogens produce destructive inflammation in the intestine and cause death or contribute to it by provoking disease in other tissues, especially septicaemia and fatty liver, or by combining these effects with antecedent or concomitant conditions, especially pneumonia and malnutrition."

The index case had severe diarrhea and metabolic acidosis and died from pneumonia on the ninth day of illness; the other five cases had only mild to moderate diarrhea. Fish caught in Agana Bay and home-preserved was found to be the vehicle most likely responsible for the cases. Vibrio cholerae, El Tor Ogawa, was isolated from two patients, the Guam sewerage system, and a river emptying into Agana Bay. V. cholerae, El Tor Inaba, was isolated from the sewerage system, three storm drains imptying into Agana Bay, and Agana Bay. The Ogawa and Inaba isolates differed in their sucrose fermentation and hemolysis reactions, phage type and ability to produce toxin. Although this was the first reported cholera outbreak on Guam, the isolation of differentV. cholerae strains suggested that multiple introductions of V. cholerae had occurred on the island."
