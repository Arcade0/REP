","SPECIES:Bacillus anthracisID:10100352TITLE:[Pulmonary anthrax].ABSTRACT:Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. Skin disease is the most common form in humans. Pulmonary anthrax related to the inhalation of airborne germs develops after a silent incubation period of several days and followed by acute respiratory distress. Diagnosis is a difficult task and generally based on demonstration of Bacillus anthracis on direct examination. Despite the sensitivity of B. anthracis to penicillin, treatment is rarely successful."

","SPECIES:Bacillus anthracisID:10559102TITLE:Inhalational anthrax: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management.ABSTRACT:Anthrax, a disease of great historical interest, is once again making headlines as an agent of biological warfare. Bacillus anthracis, a rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium, primarily infects herbivores. Humans can acquire anthrax by agricultural or industrial exposure to infected animals or animal products. More recently, the potential for intentional release of anthrax spores in the environment has caused much concern. The common clinical manifestations of anthrax are cutaneous disease, pulmonary disease from inhalation of anthrax spores, and GI disease. The course of inhalational anthrax is dramatic, from the insidious onset of nonspecific influenza-like symptoms to severe dyspnea, hypotension, and hemorrhage within days of exposure. A rapid decline, culminating in septic shock, respiratory distress, and death within 24 h is not uncommon. The high mortality seen in inhalational anthrax is in part due to delays in diagnosis. Classic findings on the chest radiograph include widening of the mediastinum as well as pleural effusions. Pneumonia is less common; key pathologic manifestations include severe hemorrhagic mediastinitis, diffuse hemorrhagic lymphadenitis, and edema. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Treatment involves supportive care in an intensive care facility and high doses of penicillin. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins has been noted. Vaccines are currently available and have been shown to be effective against aerosolized exposure in animal studies."

","SPECIES:Bacillus anthracisID:11770263TITLE:[Anthrax due to deliberate infection].ABSTRACT:Anthrax is a zoonosis which is particularly prevalent in cattle, goats and sheep and is caused by Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive spore forming aerobic microorganism. The endospores can survive outside of the body for many decades. The natural form of anthrax has a cutaneous, pulmonary and intestinal form. The pulmonary form can be rapidly fatal but is difficult to recognise due to an initially non-specific, flu-like clinical picture. As a result of spores being inhaled, a mediastinal lymphadenitis arises from which a systemic disease develops with a violent toxaemia, damage to the vascular endothelium, oedema, internal haemorrhages and circulatory collapse. Anthrax is diagnosed by demonstrating the presence of the bacteria in the cutaneous abnormality, in blood or another sterile body component such as cerebrospinal fluid, by means of a direct preparation, immunofluorescence or surface antigens, molecular diagnostics with PCR, or by means of culturing. B. anthracis is sensitive to quinolones, clindamycin and tetracyclines, and often to penicillin. Although naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax can be effectively treated with a short antibiotic cure, it is nevertheless advised in the USA to complete the full 60-day cure and to regard the cutaneous manifestation as a telltale sign of possible respiratory exposure. Anthrax is not transmitted from one person to another."

The patient presented with shortness of breath, malaise, and cough that had developed 3 days prior to admission. Within hours of presentation, she developed respiratory failure and septic shock and required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. Spiral contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest demonstrated large bilateral pleural effusions and hemorrhagic mediastinitis. Blood cultures, as well as DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction of the blood, bronchial washings, and pleural fluid specimens, were positive for Bacillus anthracis. The clinical course was complicated by liver failure, renal failure, severe metabolic acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and cardiac tamponade, and the patient died on the fourth hospital day. The cause of death was inhalational anthrax. Despite epidemiologic investigation, including environmental samples from the patient's residence and workplace, no mechanism for anthrax exposure has been identified."

Mostly, the patients had been infected as a consequence of impaired immunity. In some cases, bioterrorist activities may also induce pneumonia by gram positive rods (B. anthracis). In order to bring these organisms to the attention of the medical community, we present three clinical cases and describe six species of gram positive rods, known to provoke this kind of pneumonias. Case 1 was a 84 years old patient with impaired lung function. He was suspicious of tuberculosis (Tbc). Nocardia spec. was isolated. Case 2 was an alcoholic of 46 years with pneumonia. Reactivation of Tbc was suspected. Actinomadura madurae has been isolated. Case 3 was a patient of 58 years with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and pneumonia. N. asteroides was isolated. All patients shared impaired immunity (age, alcoholism, MDS) with impaired lung functions; Tbc had been suspected (Case 1 + 2). Infection by A. madurae was contained by Clindamycin. Therapy of Nocardia with Moxifloxacin (Case 1) or Bactrim (Case 3) was only partly effective. In the appendix, six species of gram positive rods which are known to cause pneumonia, are summarized (Nocardia, Actinomyceta, Actinomadura, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Bacillus)."

In the first days of the attack, there was confusion and miscommunication. Patients presented to emergency rooms and to their primary care physicians with severe pneumonia. Days passed and a person died before the cause of pneumonia was recognized as Bacillus anthracis. In a biologic attack, the prompt recognition of the biologic agent is key to the outcome for both individual patients and potentially even our society. The three category A bacterial agents, anthrax, tularemia, and plague, can all present as a necrotizing pneumonia. If an attack occurred during flu season when there is already an increase in pneumonia, most physicians will initially have a great deal of difficulty determining that these cases are different. Yet, considering the nature of the world today every physician must be suspicious that the next pneumonia he or she sees could be the index case of anthrax, tularemia, or plague. The challenge for the clinician evaluating a patient presenting with the presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is differentiating between the various possible etiologies that can cause this clinical picture. Each of these three class A agents has it own microbiologic and clinical characteristics. They are discussed here."

Sporadic reports have described rare, fulminant, and sometimes fatal cases of pneumonia in humans and nonhuman primates caused by strains of Bacillus cereus , a species closely related to Bacillus anthracis. OBJECTIVES: To describe and investigate a case of rapidly progressive, fatal, anthrax-like pneumonia and the overwhelming infection caused by a Bacillus species of uncertain provenance in a patient residing in rural Texas. DESIGN: We characterized the genome of the causative strain within days of its recovery from antemortem cultures using next-generation sequencing and performed immunohistochemistry on tissues obtained at autopsy with antibodies directed against virulence proteins of B anthracis and B cereus. RESULTS: We discovered that the infection was caused by a previously unknown strain of B cereus that was closely related to, but genetically distinct from, B anthracis . The strain contains a plasmid similar to pXO1, a genetic element encoding anthrax toxin and other known virulence factors. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that several homologs of B anthracis virulence proteins were made in infected tissues, likely contributing to the patient's death. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid genome sequence analysis permitted us to genetically define this strain, rule out the likelihood of bioterrorism, and contribute effectively to the institutional response to this event. Our experience strongly reinforced the critical value of deploying a well-integrated, anatomic, clinical, and genomic strategy to respond rapidly to a potential emerging, infectious threat to public health."

","SPECIES:Bacillus anthracisID:26939756TITLE:A case report of inhalation anthrax acquired naturally.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Anthrax is a zoonotic occupational disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a rod-shaped immobile aerobic gram-positive bacteria with spore. Anthrax occurs in humans randomly and with low frequency. Most cases of anthrax are acquired through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. This old disease became particularly important since 2001 that the biological spores were exploited in America. Depending on the transmission method of the disease, clinical manifestations occur in three classes: Cutaneous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal anthrax. The respiratory form is considered as the most fatal and a rare form of anthrax intending to show complicated and unusual manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report a rare case of inhalation anthrax acquired naturally in southeast of Iran is presented. A blind 65-year-old man, living in a rural area, was admitted with respiratory infection, fever, dyspnea, loss of appetite, and myalgia. The patient was treated with outpatient antibiotics a week ago. After admission, the patient was again treated for pneumonia, but there was no improvement despite treatment and the patient was suffering from septicemia symptoms. Radiographic images showed wide mediastinum. Bacillus anthracis was isolated from blood and sputum culture and the results were confirmed by colony morphology, biochemical reactions and PCR. The treatment was changed to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, and penicillin. On the second day of anthrax treatment, the patient was complicated with jaundice, elevation of liver enzymes, and a significant drop in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet despite lack of obvious bleeding and was complicated with respiratory distress and sepsis and died a week after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We could discover no specific exposure associated with anthrax infection for this patient. However, due to being located in an endemic and enzootic area, it is proposed that the exposure occurred through contact with infected airborne dust or an unknown contaminated item. Despite many advances in preventing anthrax, still some rare cases of respiratory and complicated anthrax are emerging. With regard to the threat of bioterrorism, medical staff's sensitivity to the clinical syndrome, methods of prophylaxis and treatment of anthrax must be raised. Fast diagnosis and successful treatment the lethal cases of this infection are of utmost important."

It is naturally widely distributed, and thus often contaminates cultures. Although it is rarely considered responsible, it can cause serious infections under certain conditions. However, lethal infections, especially in immunocompetent patients, are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 60-year-old man developed community-acquired B. cereus pneumonia and alveolar hemorrhage unveiled by abrupt chest pain and hemoptysis with no other advance symptoms. B. cereus induced silent alveolar destruction without any local or systemic inflammatory response. Although the lesion resembled lung anthrax, there was no evidence of Bacillus anthracis toxin. CONCLUSIONS: Some isolates of B. cereus can cause anthrax-like fulminant necrotizing pneumonia in immunocompetent patients. If this type of B. cereus were used as a means of bioterrorism, it may be quite difficult to recognize as bioterrorism. We should keep B. cereus in mind as a potential pathogen of fulminant human infectious disease."

The last Swiss outbreak was over 20 years ago. We describe a recent anthrax outbreak involving two cows from the same herd. One cow was designated as a peracute clinical case with sudden death and typical lung lesions, while the other cow presented with protracted fever and abortion. CASE PRESENTATION: On April 29th 2017, a 3.5-year-old Montbeliard dairy cow was found dead while out at pasture with haemorrhage from the nose. The veterinarian suspected pneumonia and performed a necropsy on site. Subsequently, a lung and liver sample were sent to the laboratory. Unexpectedly, Bacillus anthracis was isolated, a pathogen not found in Switzerland for decades. Several days later, a second cow from the same farm showed signs of abortion after protracted fever. Since these symptoms are not typical for anthrax, and the bacteria could not be demonstrated in blood samples from this animal, a necropsy was performed under appropriate biosafety measures. Subsequently, Bacillus anthracis could be isolated from the placenta and the sublumbal lymph nodes but not from the blood, liver, spleen and kidney. The outbreak strain (17OD930) was shown to belong to the lineage B.Br.CNEVA, the same as Swiss strains from previous outbreaks in the region. We speculate that the disease came from a temporarily opened cave system that is connected to an old carcass burial site and was flushed by heavy rainfall preceding the outbreak. CONCLUSION: Even in countries like Switzerland, where anthrax is very rare, new cases can occur after unusual weather conditions or ground disturbance. It is important for public officials to be aware of this risk to avoid possible spread."

Some of the more common acute, overwhelming infections of the central nervous system and lungs are covered elsewhere in this issue. We have selected less common, potentially catastrophic syndromes that might be recognized earlier if certain historical clues, physical findings, or laboratory abnormalities are appreciated. Specific and effective therapy is available for most of the diseases we have chosen. Meningitis due to Naegleria fowleri, a free-living ameba that may invade the central nervous system through the cribriform plate in persons swimming in brackish water, and hemorrhagic mediastinitis due to inhalation of Bacillus anthracis, which is acquired in occupational exposure to goat's hair, wool, or an animal with anthrax, are other examples but are lacking in proven effective therapy. Although most physicians quickly consider exotic and overwhelming infections in the severely compromised patient, fewer recognize this risk in the diabetic, cirrhotic, or healthy person with a unique occupational or travel history. During the present epidemic of AIDS, previous exposure to the HTLV-3 virus must be considered in all severely ill patients. The proper use of new diagnostic tests may permit the physician to intercede effectively if these life-threatening diseases are suspected."

A series of 42 necropsies, representing a majority of the fatalities from this outbreak, consistently revealed pathologic lesions diagnostic of inhalational anthrax, namely hemorrhagic necrosis of the thoracic lymph nodes in the lymphatic drainage of the lungs and hemorrhagic mediastinitis. Bacillus anthracis was recovered in bacterial cultures of 20 cases, and organisms were detected microscopically in the infected tissues of nearly all of the cases. A novel observation was primary focal hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonia at the apparent portal of entry in 11 cases. Mesenteric lymphadenitis occurred in only 9 cases. This remarkably large series demonstrated the full range of effects of anthrax bacteremia and toxemia (edema especially adjacent to sites of extensive infection and pleural effusions) and hematogenously disseminated infection [hemorrhagic meningitis (21 cases) and multiple gastrointestinal submucosal hemorrhagic lesions (39 cases)]."

The presentation was severe, essentially marked by respiratory distress and pleuritic chest pain. Classic empirical treatment initiated for febrile neutropenia did not cover this rare pathogen and appropriate therapy was therefore delayed. B. cereus is most often a culture contaminant, but it can also be responsible for self-limited gastrointestinal intoxication and, more rarely, severe systemic diseases. Virulence in the case of systemic disease is attributed to tissue necrosis mediated by toxin release. B. cereus pneumonia, as described in the English-language literature, mainly affects immunocompromised patients and most often has a fatal outcome. Thus, the identification of B. cereus in clinical specimens of severely ill immunocompromised patients should lead physicians to question its clinical significance."

The patient presented with a nonproductive cough, dyspnea, edema in both lower extremities, orthopnea, fever, and occult blood in the stool. A chest radiograph indicated bilateral pleural effusion and pulmonary congestion. After diuretic therapy and chest drainage, bilateral pleural effusion and pulmonary congestion improved. On day 2, she experienced severe respiratory distress. B. cereus was isolated from two blood sample cultures. On day 4, her condition had progressed to severe respiratory distress (PaO2/FiO2 ratio = 108). A chest radiograph and computed tomography indicated extensive bilateral infiltrates. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and was intubated. B. cereus was also isolated from five blood sample cultures at that time.

Thoracentesis yielded a sanguinopurulent, foul smelling exudate that showed sheets of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and many gram-positive bacilli. A tube thoracostomy was performed and treatment with intravenous penicillin G was begun. Twenty-four hours later a Bacillus species later identified as Bacillus cereus was identified from aerobic cultures. Because the organism was resistant to penicillin, the patient was switched to intravenous chloramphenicol. A second organism was noted to grow slowly under anaerobic conditions and was later identified as Clostridium bifermentans. Despite initial clinical improvement, fever and empyema persisted resulting in a thoracotomy with resection of the infected lung and extensive decortication. Specimens from the lung tissue obtained at surgery also grew both Bacillus cereus and Clostridium bifermentans. Subsequent review of the original pleural fluid smears revealed a degree of pleomorphism that was not initially appreciated. Prompt surgical intervention combined with appropriate antibiotics resulted in a cure of this unusual aerobic/anaerobic infection."

DESIGN: A prospective survey of all intensive care unit patients who were culture-positive for B cereus and obtaining of environmental cultures of the cleaning and assembly area of the respiratory services division between October 1991 and September 1992. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Ventilated patients from a 16-bed medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in a 1,000-bed adult tertiary care hospital. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: From October 1991 to April 1992, B cereus colonized the ventilator circuitry of patients in the ICU. One of two washer/decontaminators in the cleaning and assembly area of the respiratory services division was found to yield the microorganism consistently from the water intake port. The design of the machine precluded easy decontamination of the port with 2% glutaraldehyde and a second outbreak occurred. Following the second outbreak, aqueous chlorhexidine in a final concentration of 0.05% was added to the first of two pasteurization cycles in an attempt to achieve sporicidal activity. This ended the outbreak. Sixty-two patients became colonized with the organism including two with nonfatal Bacillus sepsis and one death due to pneumonia associated with the organism. CONCLUSION: This experience emphasizes the importance of obtaining cultures of machine parts to identify the source of contamination and thereby direct control measures. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate at high temperatures effectively eradicated B cereus from ventilator circuitry in a practical and cost-effective manner."

As a result, epidemics of vaccine-preventable diseases have occurred, especially in urban areas. Six of the infections prevented by immunization--those caused by Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, measles virus, and influenza virus--frequently cause respiratory tract disease. Pneumonia in children may have subtle presentations and require special considerations depending on the age and condition of the child and the current rate of disease in the community. In addition to the epidemics occurring throughout the country, the growing number of immunocompromised children has also influenced diagnostic, treatment, and prevention considerations. These patients include children with cancer, organ transplants, congenital immune disorders, sickle cell disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, as well as other disorders that lead to increased risk of infection. The current recommendations for routine and special childhood immunizations are reviewed in this article."

Respiratory samples were recovered from hospitalised patients who were diagnosed of pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic respiratory infections. The samples were Gram-stained and seeded on conventional bacterial growing media. Bacteria were identified by matrix-assisted linear desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method. All patients presented an acute respiratory onset, most of them in the context of an underlying disease and/or immunosuppression. In all patients, the microscopical examination of Gram-stained respiratory samples showed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and Gram-positive bacilli, suggestive of the Corynebacterium morphotype. A pure culture growth of Corynebacterium was obtained in the majority (72 %) of samples. The conclusions are that non-diphtheriae Corynebacterium species are an emerging cause of respiratory infection among patients with chronic respiratory disease and/or immunosuppression, and cannot always be considered as mere colonisers. The microorganism's predominance in Gram-stained purulent respiratory samples together with abundant growth in the culture is the key for the microbiological diagnosis."

This study evaluated the level of diphtheria (DT) and pertussis (PT)-related antibodies among children with pneumonia in Ji'nan, China. METHODS: A total of 484 sera of children from 1 day to 13 years of age were collected from 2014 to 2015 in Ji'nan. Children with recent history of pertussis were excluded from this study. Anti-DT and PT IgG concentrations were measured by ELISA (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). RESULTS: Of the 484 subjects tested, the overall positivity rate of anti-DT IgG (&gt;=0.1 IU/ml) was 48.97%, and the highest positivity rate of anti-DT IgG (68.55%) and proportion with long term protection (23.27%) were observed in children aged 6 m- &lt; 3 y. For anti-PT IgG, 334 subjects (69.01%) had anti-PT IgG levels below the lower limit of detection (5 IU/ml). Even with detectable anti-PT antibodies, the majority (115/150, 76.67%) of them had antibody levels of 5- &lt; 40 IU/ml. The highest proportion of subjects with detectable anti-PT IgG (&gt;=5 IU/ml) was observed in children aged &lt; 6 m (44.36%), then the proportion continually decreased to 15.0% at 3 y- &lt; 6 y (chi2 = 24.05, p &lt; 0.0001). The highest positivity rate (&gt;=40 IU/ml) was only 8.27% in children aged &lt; 6 m. Subjects with an anti-PT IgG &gt;=100 IU/ml were observed in all the groups and there were no significant differences in the proportions of subjects with a level &gt;= 100 IU/ml among these age groups (chi2 = 2.572, p = 0.4624). A total of 5 subjects had anti-PT IgG &gt;=100 IU/ml (&gt;=1 years post pertussis vaccination) which was considered to be indicative of a recent pertussis infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated low antibody levels and protection against pertussis in our study population. The anti-PT IgG maintained a low level throughout all age groups, and even no immune responses were observed after the basic immunization and booster. Our study supported the need to reevaluate the immune response of DTP vaccine which was used in Shandong province after 2010."

However, the disease has still not been eradicated and continues to occur in all of Europe. In order to prevent sequelae or a fatal outcome, diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) should be administered to suspected diphtheria patients as soon as possible, but economic factors and issues concerning regulations have led to poor availability of DAT in many countries. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and World Health Organization have called for European Union-wide solutions to this DAT-shortage. In order to illustrate the importance of these efforts and underline the need for continued diphtheria surveillance, we present data on all registered cases of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis in Belgium during the past decade, up to and including 2017."

Diphtheria is generally an acute respiratory infection, characterized by the formation of a pseudomembrane in the throat, but cutaneous infections are possible. Systemic effects, such as myocarditis and neuropathy, which are associated with increased fatality risk, are due to diphtheria toxin, an exotoxin produced by the pathogen that inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death. Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation and identification of the causative Corynebacterium spp., usually by bacterial culture followed by enzymatic and toxin detection tests. Diphtheria can be treated with the timely administration of diphtheria antitoxin and antimicrobial therapy. Although effective vaccines are available, this disease has the potential to re-emerge in countries where the recommended vaccination programmes are not sustained, and increasing proportions of adults are becoming susceptible to diphtheria. Thousands of diphtheria cases are still reported annually from several countries in Asia and Africa, along with many outbreaks. Changes in the epidemiology of diphtheria have been reported worldwide. The prevalence of toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. highlights the need for proper clinical and epidemiological investigations to quickly identify and treat affected individuals, along with public health measures to prevent and contain the spread of this disease."

Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological information for toxigenic cases between 2009 and 2017 are described in this population-based prospective surveillance study.ResultsThere were 33 toxigenic cases of diphtheria aged 4 to 82 years. Causative species were C. diphtheriae (n = 18) and C. ulcerans (n = 15). Most C. diphtheriae cases were cutaneous (14/18) while more than half of C. ulcerans cases had respiratory presentations (8/15). Two thirds (23/33) of cases were inadequately immunised. Two cases with C. ulcerans infections died, both inadequately immunised. The major risk factor for C. diphtheriae aquisition was travel to an endemic area and for C. ulcerans, contact with a companion animal. Most confirmed C. diphtheriae or C. ulcerans isolates (441/507; 87%) submitted for toxigenicity testing were non-toxigenic, however, toxin positivity rates were higher (15/23) for C. ulcerans than C. diphtheriae (18/469). Ten non-toxigenic toxin gene-bearing (NTTB) C. diphtheriae were also detected.ConclusionDiphtheria is a rare disease in the UK.

Although resistance to erythromycin has been recognised, beta-lactam resistance in toxigenic diphtheria has not been described. Here, we report a case of fatal respiratory diphtheria caused by toxigenic C. diphtheriae resistant to penicillin and all other beta-lactam antibiotics and describe a novel mechanism of inducible carbapenem resistance associated with the acquisition of a mobile resistance element. METHODS: Long-read whole genome sequencing was performed using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing to determine the genome sequence of C. diphtheriae BQ11 and mechanism of beta-lactam resistance. To investigate phenotypic inducibility of meropenem resistance, short read sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer on the strain with and without exposure to meropenem. RESULTS: BQ11 demonstrated high-level resistance to penicillin (benzylpenicillin MIC >= 256 mug/ml), beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors and cephalosporins (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MIC >= 256 mug/mL; ceftriaxone MIC >= 8 mug/L). Genomic analysis of BQ11 identified acquisition of a novel transposon carrying the penicillin binding protein Pbp2c, responsible for resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins. When strain BQ11 was exposed to meropenem, selective pressure drove amplification of the transposon in a tandem array and led to a corresponding change from a low level to high level meropenem resistant phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel mechanism of inducible antibiotic resistance whereby isolates that appear to be carbapenem susceptible on initial testing can develop in vivo resistance to carbapenems with repeated exposure. This phenomenon could have significant implications for treatment of C. diphtheriae infection and may lead to clinical failure."

BACKGROUND: Respiratory diphtheria is a toxin-mediated disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria-like illness, clinically indistinguishable from diphtheria, is caused by C. ulcerans, a zoonotic bacterium that can also produce diphtheria toxin. In the United States, respiratory diphtheria is nationally notifiable: specimens from suspected cases are submitted to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for species and toxin confirmation, and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is obtained from CDC for treatment. We summarize the epidemiology of respiratory diphtheria and diphtheria-like illness and describe DAT use during 1996-2018 in the United States. METHODS: We described respiratory diphtheria cases reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness identified through specimen submissions to CDC during 1996-2018. We reviewed DAT requests from 1997-2018. RESULTS: From 1996-2018, 14 respiratory diphtheria cases were reported to NNDSS. Among these 14 cases, 1 was toxigenic and 3 were non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae by culture and Elek, 6 were culture-negative but PCR-positive for diphtheria toxin gene, 1 was culture-positive without further testing, and the remaining 3 were either not tested or tested negative. Five cases of respiratory diphtheria-like illness caused by toxigenic C. ulcerans were identified. DAT was requested by healthcare providers for 151 suspected diphtheria cases between 1997-2018, with an average of 11 requests per year from 1997-2007, and 3 per year from 2008-2018. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory diphtheria remains rare in the United States, and requests for DAT have declined. Incidental identification of C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness suggests surveillance of this condition might be warranted."

Recently several global diphtheria outbreaks have resulted from the breakdown of healthcare infrastructures particularly in countries experiencing political conflict. This report summarizes a laboratory and epidemiological investigation of a diphtheria outbreak among Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals in Bangladesh. METHODS: Specimens and clinical information were collected from patients presenting at Diphtheria Treatment Centers. Swabs were tested for toxin-gene (tox) bearing C. diphtheriae by real-time (RT) PCR and culture. The isolation of another Corynebacterium species prompted further laboratory investigation. RESULTS: Among 382 patients; 153 (40%) tested tox-positive for C. diphtheriae by RT-PCR; 31 (20%) PCR-positive swabs were culture-confirmed. RT-PCR revealed 78% (298/382) of patients tested positive for C. pseudodiphtheriticum. Of patients positive for only C. diphtheriae, 63% (17/27) had severe disease compared to 55% (69/126) positive for both Corynebacterium species, and 38% (66/172) for only C. pseudodiphtheriticum.

Especially in developing countries, non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae strains are now emerging as cause of invasive disease like endocarditis. The present case stands out for reinforcing the high virulence of this pathogen, demonstrated by the multiple systemic embolism and severe valve deterioration. It also emphasizes the importance of a coordinated interdisciplinary work to address all these challenges related to infectious endocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old male cocaine drug abuser presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of fever, asthenia and dyspnea. His physical examination revealed a mitral systolic murmur, signs of acute arterial occlusion of the left lower limb, severe arterial hypotension and acute respiratory failure, with need of vasoactive drugs, orotracheal intubation/mechanical ventilation, empiric antimicrobial therapy and emergent endovascular treatment. The clinical suspicion of acute infective endocarditis was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography, demonstrating a large vegetation on the mitral valve associated with severe valvular regurgitation. Abdominal ultrasound was normal with no hepatic, renal, or spleen abscess. Serial blood cultures and thrombus culture, obtained in the vascular procedure, identified non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae, with antibiotic therapy adjustment to monotherapy with ampicillin. Since the patient had a severe septic shock with sustained fever, despite antimicrobial therapy, urgent cardiac surgical intervention was planned. Anatomical findings were compatible with an aggressive endocarditis, requiring mitral valve replacement for a biological prosthesis. During the postoperative period, despite an initial clinical recovery and successfully weaning from mechanical ventilation, the patient presented with a recrudescent daily fever. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a hypoattenuating and extensive splenic lesion suggestive of abscess. After sonographically guided bridging percutaneous catheter drainage, surgical splenectomy was performed. Despite left limb revascularization, a forefoot amputation was required due to gangrene. The patient had a good clinical recovery, fulfilling 4-weeks of antimicrobial treatment. CONCLUSION: Despite the effectiveness of toxoid-based vaccines, recent global outbreaks of invasive C. diphtheriae infectious related to non-toxigenic strains have been described. These infectious could be highly invasive as demonstrated in this case. Interdisciplinary work with an institutional ""endocarditis team"" is essential to achieve favorable clinical outcomes in such defiant scenarios."

WGS analysis showed that 10 isolates, including three toxigenic isolates, harbored a variety of antibiotic resistance genes in addition to the high prevalence of penicillin resistance phenotypically demonstrated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed one cluster of isolates from family members. Risk information was available for toxigenic isolates (9/39); three patients reported recent travels to endemic countries and three had contact with cats/dogs. One unvaccinated child with respiratory diphtheria had a fatal outcome. Including non-toxigenic Corynebacterium infections in the disease surveillance and using WGS could further improve current surveillance."

The morphological changes were characterized by a complex of typical changes at the primary focus, intracanalicular and hematogenous dissemination with high bacteremia. The morphology of pneumonia caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria is described for the first time. At the early stages of the disease infectious-toxic degeneration of the myocardium was documented with predominating alteration of the atrioventricular node or contractile myocardium. The above morphological features may be due to peculiarities of patients and decreased subjects as well as possible changes in the pathogen characteristics."

A heart transplant recipient who had been treated with amphotericin B for pulmonary aspergillosis showed newly developed multiple nodules with a central necrotic area in the right lower lobes. Cultures of several blood samples and an aspirate of the lung nodule yielded a Gram-positive coccobacillary bacterium, which was initially reported as a Corynebacterium species, but was later identified as R. equi by API CORYNE (bioMerieux SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by demonstrating the production of 'equi factor'. The identification was subsequently confirmed by an R. equi-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was successfully treated with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin for 14 weeks. This is the first documented case of R. equi infection in Korea. There is a possibility of underestimation of R. equi infections due to the misidentification of the organism as a contaminating diphtheroid. Because R. equi will not respond to the conventional empirical therapy, the microbiology laboratory should identify R. equi in a timely manner. R. equi-specific PCR will be a useful confirmatory test in human infection."

Chemotaxonomic investigations revealed the presence of cell-wall chemotype IV and short chain mycolic acids consistent with the genus Corynebacterium.

Sequence divergence values of &gt;2.7 % from established corynebacterial species suggested that the new isolate represented a novel species. This was also supported by the results of the biochemical tests.

We prospectively compared semiquantitative (SQ) and quantitative (Qu) culture of BAL for VAP diagnosis. Ventilated patients suspected of VAP underwent bronchoscopic BAL. BAL fluid was examined by both Qu (colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) and SQ culture (none, sparse, moderate, or heavy) and results were compared. VAP was defined as 105 CFU/mL or greater on Qu culture. Over 36 months, 319 BALs were performed. Sixty-three of 319 (20%) showed diagnostic growth by Qu culture identifying a total of 81 organisms causing VAP. All 63 specimens showed growth of some organism(s) on SQ culture with 79 of 81 causative organisms identified and two (Pseudomonas, one; Corynebacterium, one) not identified. The remaining 256 specimens did not meet the threshold for VAP by the Qu method. Among these, 79 did not show any growth on SQ culture. Among the 240 specimens showing some growth on SQ culture, a total of 384 organisms were identified. VAP rates in relation to strength of growth on SQ culture were: sparse, 10 of 140 (7%); moderate, 24 of 147 (16%); and heavy, 45 of 97 (46%). Sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive (PPV), and negative (NPV) predictive values of SQ culture of BAL fluid for the diagnosis of VAP were 97, 21, 21, and 97 per cent, respectively. Nonquantitative culture of BAL fluid is fairly accurate in ruling out VAP (high Sn and NPV).

This slow-growing lipophilic organism is not reliably isolated using routine culture methods. A novel selective culture medium (CKSM) is designed to optimise the isolation of this organism from clinical specimens. METHODS: CKSM contains 10% galactose and Tween 80 (10%) to enhance the growth of C. kroppenstedtii, fosfomycin (100 microg/mL) to suppress the other bacteria, and differentiate C. kroppenstedtii from non-kroppenstedtii lipophilic corynebacteria by esculin hydrolysis. The medium was evaluated for its ability to support the growth of C. kroppenstedtii, selection and differentiation of C. kroppenstedtii from other bacteria in non-sterile clinical specimens. RESULTS: C. kroppenstedtii grew as 1-2 mm colonies with black halo on CKSM within 72 hours of incubation, compared with barely visible pinpoint colonies on routine blood agars. During the four-month period of evaluation with 8896 respiratory specimens, 103 breast specimens, 1903 female genital tract specimens, 617 newborn surface swabs and 10 011 miscellaneous specimens, 186 C. kroppenstedtii were isolated, including 127 (1.4%) respiratory and 59 (0.5%) miscellaneous specimens, 184 of them were found only on CKSM. Besides the three (2.9%) positive breast specimens, 27 (1.4%) high vaginal and endocervical swabs, and 11 (1.8%) surface swabs of newborns were positive for C. kroppenstedtii. CONCLUSIONS: CKSM is a useful addition to routine agar media for the isolation of C. kroppenstedtii, and will be helpful for studying the epidemiology and transmission of this unusual Corynebacterium causing granulomatous mastitis."

Non-diphtheria Corynebacterium spp., a component of this flora, is commonly viewed as a contaminant, but it may be the cause of pneumonia and the frequency with which it causes CAP may be underestimated. Case presentations: This report present 3 cases of CAP in which Corynebacterium spp. was clearly the predominant isolate; identification was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Two cases were caused by C. propinquum and one by C. striatum. Two patients had a tracheostomy and one was on hemodialysis. Patients who received an appropriate antibiotic responded well. Conclusion: When identified as the predominant isolate in sputum from a patient with CAP, Corynebacterium spp. should be considered as a potential cause of the infection. In cases with patients who have compromised airway clearance or who are immunocompromised, microaspiration may be responsible. While some Corynebacterium spp. are suspectible to antibiotics usually prescribed for CAP, others are susceptible only to vancomycin or aminoglycosides. Vancomycin is thus the appropriate empiric antibiotic, pending speciation and susceptibility test results.

In recent years, Corynebacterium striatum has emerged as a multi-drug resistant human pathogen which can cause nosocomial outbreaks. The organism has infrequently been noted to cause respiratory infections. A retrospective study was conducted to identify the clinical and microbiological features of respiratory infection by Corynebacterium striatum. METHODOLOGY: C. striatum isolates from clinical and surveillance samples were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobials and typed by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Clinical data was obtained through a retrospective review of records. RESULTS: 15 isolates from clinical and surveillance samples of 11 hospitalised patients were included. The patients suffered from either an exacerbation of COPD (n = 9) or pneumonia (n = 2). The isolates were all multi-drug resistant. RAPD typing found no evidence of an outbreak/ transmission between patients. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium spp. must be considered potential pathogens. Suspicious isolates should be identified to the species level since Corynebacterium striatum is often multi-drug resistant."

Due to the morphological and biochemical similarities to others pathogens, such as Gordona, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, Nocardia, and Mycobacterium, a molecular-based approach is indispensable to correctly identify them. Herein, we describe a case of Tsukamurella inchonensis bacteremia complicated with septic pulmonary emboli (SPE), which is the first in the literature. A 44-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with tongue cancer had undergone partial tongue resection. While receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she developed high fever. Chest computed tomography suggested multiple emboli at the bilateral, peripheral lungs, indicating SPE. Blood culture detected Gram-positive rods, to which matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry failed to identify. Then, we attempted to characterize it by 16S rRNA sequence, which suggested the organism to be Tsukamurella species but resulted in low resonance of the species-level identification. Additionally, we employed a confidence gene targeting groEL, leading to 100% matching (753/753 bps) with T. inchonensis NCTC 10741 (GenBank accession no. LR131273.1), which has been incorrectly registered as wrong species name Tsukamurella paurometabola in the database. Under the diagnosis of T. inchonensis-associated SPE, we successfully treated the patient with imipenem/cilastatin administration for 4 weeks. Sequencing analysis of groEL was of great use in identifying the organism in this case. More clinical cases based on molecular diagnosis of the fastidious pathogens need to be accumulated to further understand the characteristics and appropriate treatment regimen."

Isolation of MDR C. striatum as the only organism from respiratory samples from hospitalized patients is increasing in China. AIM: To elucidate the genomic epidemiology and evolution of C. striatum in China. METHODS: 260 isolates from 2016 to 2018 were collected from three hospitals in three regions of China. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on all isolates. Whole genome sequencing was applied to all isolates to assess their genomic diversity and relationships and detect the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) and ARG cassettes. FINDINGS: Nearly all isolates (96.2%, 250/260) showed multidrug-resistance. Genome sequencing revealed four major lineages with lineage IV emerging as the epidemic lineage. Most of the diversity was developed in the last six years. Each hospital has its own predominant clones with potential spread between Hebei and Guangdong hospitals. Genomic analysis further revealed multiple ARGs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that four lineages of C. striatum have spread in parallel across China, causing persistent and extensive transmissions within hospitals. MDR C. striatum infection has become a national epidemic. Antibiotic-driven selection pressure may have played significant roles in forming persistent and predominant clones. Our data provide the basis for surveillance and prevention strategies to control the epidemic caused by MDR C. striatum."

Each characteristic has contributed to the delay in perceiving their importance. Mycobacterium chelonei and Myco. fortuitum--which grow slowly, although characterized as ""rapid-growing"" mycobacteria--cause sternal osteomyelitis, pericarditis and endocarditis after cardiac surgery as well as other wound infections after many types of surgery. Myco. chelonei-like organisms have been found to cause ""sterile"" peritonitis in patients receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis. Legionella pneumophila and L. micdadei are fastidious bacteria that were more difficult to detect because they stain poorly with the Gram method. They cause pneumonia and lung abscess, especially in immunocompromised people. Clostridium difficile is an anaerobe that causes toxin-mediated pseudomembranous colitis in persons given antibiotics that inhibit competing gut bacteria. Chylamydia trachomatis, an intracellular organism that has not been grown in vitro, causes pneumonia and conjunctivitis in young infants who acquire the organism from their mothers at birth. Group JK bacteria cause septicemia in patients whose immune responses have been suppressed and must be distinguished from ""diphtheroid"" contaminants in blood cultures. Clinicians, microbiologists and epidemiologists must be alert to the characteristics of these organisms that make them easily overlooked and should also anticipate the existence of other bacteria not yet identified."

The aim of this study is to identify and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of coryneform bacteria isolated from blood cultures of patients seen at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and review the literature. METHODS: All coryneform bacteria isolated from blood culture specimens between January 2001 and March 2003 were prospectively identified by API Coryne System (BioMerieux, France). Clinical data were collected from each patient's medical record. Antimicrobial susceptibility to 16 antimicrobial agents were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). RESULTS: Out of 50 coryneform bacteria isolated, 19 different species were identified. Corynebacterium propinquum was the most common species 6/50 (12%) followed by Corynebacterium auris 5/50 (10%), Corynebacterium afermentans, Corynebacterium striatum, Dermabacter hominis, Brevibacterium, and Arthrobacter species 4/50 (8%) each. Underlying chest diseases were common among the patients 11/50 (22%), followed by different surgeries 10/50 (20%). Of all, 12/50 (24%) patients were from different intensive care units (ICUs), 36/50 (72%) had either vascular, urinary or respiratory intubation. Three patients in ICUs died, one was an elderly patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and 2 teenagers (one had tracheoesophageal fistula and the other was post-arrest road traffic accident patient). Vancomycin was the most active antimicrobial agent against all coryneform species. The majority had MIC &lt;1 ug/ml. For most isolates, the MIC90s of erythromycin, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin were above the break points. Corynebacterium striatum was the only isolate susceptible to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that coryneform bacteria are increasingly being recognized as a cause of serious infections in immunocompromised patients. We recommend identification and susceptibility testing of predominant isolates of coryneform bacteria from different clinical sites of seriously ill patients to select the antimicrobial agent necessary for clinical intervention."

Respiratory samples were recovered from hospitalised patients who were diagnosed of pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic respiratory infections. The samples were Gram-stained and seeded on conventional bacterial growing media. Bacteria were identified by matrix-assisted linear desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method. All patients presented an acute respiratory onset, most of them in the context of an underlying disease and/or immunosuppression. In all patients, the microscopical examination of Gram-stained respiratory samples showed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and Gram-positive bacilli, suggestive of the Corynebacterium morphotype. A pure culture growth of Corynebacterium was obtained in the majority (72 %) of samples. The conclusions are that non-diphtheriae Corynebacterium species are an emerging cause of respiratory infection among patients with chronic respiratory disease and/or immunosuppression, and cannot always be considered as mere colonisers. The microorganism's predominance in Gram-stained purulent respiratory samples together with abundant growth in the culture is the key for the microbiological diagnosis."

All of them were male with a median CD4 lymphocyte count of 110 cells/mm3 (range, 18-198/mm3); five of the seven cases occurred in persons for whom AIDS was diagnosed previously. The onset of symptomatology was usually acute and the most common radiographic appearance was alveolar infiltrate (six patients) with cavitation (two patients) and pleural effusion (two patients). In five of the seven cases, C. pseudodiphtheriticum was isolated from bronchoscopic samples and in the remaining two cases was recovered from lung biopsy (one patient) and sputum (one patient). In the three patients reported herein and in one previous case from the medical literature, quantitative culturing of bronchoscopic samples obtained through either bronchoalveolar lavage or protected brush catheter procedures yielded more than 10(3) CFU/mL. All the strains tested were susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to macrolides was common. Recovery was observed in six of the seven patients. C. pseudodiphtheriticum should be regarded as a potential respiratory pathogen in HIV-infected patients.

Such bacteria can cause infections of various localizations (bronchitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis, colpitis, dermatitis, arthritis, etc.). C. pseudodiphtheriticum and C. xerosis were isolated from clinical specimens most frequently. Corynebacterium spp. have adhesive, hemolytic, hemagglutinating, and neuraminidase activity; some of them are highly pathogenic. The most virulent, were following species: C. diphtheriae, C. pseudotuberculosis, C. urealyticum, and C. ulcerans. Corynebacterium non diphtheriae were frequently isolated from clinical specimens in association with staphylococci and streptococci. In such cases, factors of pathogenicity and resistance to antibiotics were more pronounced. Strains isolated with association with other bacteria have lost susceptibility to tetracycline, oleandomycin, penicillin, and erythromycin.

In certain conditions it can cause the opportunistic infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. In certain strains of Corynebacterium sp., the macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLSb) resistance mechanism related to the presence of the erm(X) gene was discovered; hence, the need appeared for further investigation to confirm the existence of this gene among C. pseudodiphtheriticum. About 58 strains of C. pseudodiphtheriticum were used in this study. All strains were isolated from the nasal mucous membrane of patients with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Among the tested strains 52 were erythromycin resistant, and only 6 were erythromycin sensitive. The tested strains showed a very high percentage (89.7%) of the phenotype MLSb-constitutive resistance mechanism. The MLSb-inducible resistance among the tested strains was not observed. Association of the MLSb mechanism with resistance to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was observed in 12.1%, 15.5%, and 44.8% tested strains, respectively.

Respiratory samples were recovered from hospitalised patients who were diagnosed of pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic respiratory infections. The samples were Gram-stained and seeded on conventional bacterial growing media.

All patients presented an acute respiratory onset, most of them in the context of an underlying disease and/or immunosuppression. In all patients, the microscopical examination of Gram-stained respiratory samples showed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and Gram-positive bacilli, suggestive of the Corynebacterium morphotype. A pure culture growth of Corynebacterium was obtained in the majority (72 %) of samples. The conclusions are that non-diphtheriae Corynebacterium species are an emerging cause of respiratory infection among patients with chronic respiratory disease and/or immunosuppression, and cannot always be considered as mere colonisers. The microorganism's predominance in Gram-stained purulent respiratory samples together with abundant growth in the culture is the key for the microbiological diagnosis."

Although this microorganism has been associated with respiratory complications, a few case reports have demonstrated its ability to cause orthopedic infections. A recent review of the literature was performed regarding this specific bacteria and its association with bone and joint infection. To the author's knowledge, the current case is the first reported case of chronic osteomyelitis from Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum after arthroscopic knee surgery. Isolation of this bacterial species on routine microbial cultures has been proven to be challenging in prior studies. In the current case, difficulty isolating this bacterial species on routine cultures led to a significant delay in diagnosis, which ultimately resulted in end-stage joint destruction. Treatment of the infection was accomplished using a 2-stage total knee arthroplasty technique, with the initial placement of an articulated, antibiotic-loaded spacer followed by a subsequent conversion to total knee arthroplasty. This case serves as a useful reminder that clinically subtle infections can occur after minor orthopedic surgery. Surgeons must remain vigilant to render a timely diagnosis and avoid severe sequelae that can result from an undetected pathogen after arthroscopic surgery."

Recently several global diphtheria outbreaks have resulted from the breakdown of healthcare infrastructures particularly in countries experiencing political conflict. This report summarizes a laboratory and epidemiological investigation of a diphtheria outbreak among Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals in Bangladesh. METHODS: Specimens and clinical information were collected from patients presenting at Diphtheria Treatment Centers. Swabs were tested for toxin-gene (tox) bearing C. diphtheriae by real-time (RT) PCR and culture. The isolation of another Corynebacterium species prompted further laboratory investigation. RESULTS: Among 382 patients; 153 (40%) tested tox-positive for C. diphtheriae by RT-PCR; 31 (20%) PCR-positive swabs were culture-confirmed. RT-PCR revealed 78% (298/382) of patients tested positive for C. pseudodiphtheriticum.

We describe the clinical and microbiologic features of 17 patients from whose sputum C. pseudodiphtheriticum was isolated. Patients were identified through a review of the reports from the clinical microbiology laboratory at York Hospital, a community teaching hospital, from October 1990 through April 1993; 17 patients with respiratory infection caused by C. pseudodiphthriticum were identified. There were 12 cases of bronchitis and five of pneumonia. An underlying systemic condition, particularly congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or malignancy, was common. Onset of symptomatology was acute for most patients, but fever was noticeably absent in almost two-thirds of the cases. Isolates were uniformly susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics, vancomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin was common. The isolation of diphtheroids from a properly obtained sputum sample from a patient with respiratory tract infection should not always be dismissed as due to contamination. The isolation, identification, and susceptibility testing of C. pseudodiphtheriticum from respiratory tract specimens may provide information useful for treatment of patients."

The ages of patients ranged from 24 to 77 years; the ratio of male to female patients was 3:1. One patient had three episodes of infection, and another patient had two. In one patient, who died of disseminated intravascular coagulation, the level of IgG was low. One patient was receiving prednisolone when the infection occurred. In two cases a mixed infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae was noted. Sputum cultures yielded C. pseudodiphtheriticum (&gt; or = 10(7) cfu/mL). An increased neutrophil response in the sputum of infected patients was observed. Gram staining and electron microscopy of sputum showed phagocytosis of C. pseudodiphtheriticum by the neutrophils. ELISAs also showed an increase in the level of immunoglobulin against C. pseudodiphtheriticum after infection. Tests for determination of MICs of antibiotics revealed that C. pseudodiphtheriticum isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. All strains were resistant to nalidixic acid; borderline susceptibility to ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin was noted.

Diphtheria vaccine does not provide protection against asymptomatic carriage and colonization of non-toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is a known fact that invasive infections may arise from non-toxigenic C.diphtheriae strains that the non-toxigenic strains can become toxigenic strains leading to diphteria. It is also known that there is a risk of diphteria outbreaks due to decreased antitoxin level and inadequate adult immunization programs. In our country, there is no routine surveillance of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C.diphtheriae. In the present study we aimed to investigate the presence of C.diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in children presenting with the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections that might be confused with those moderate diphteria, in order to highlight the requirement of microbiological surveillance and to create awareness about these microorganisms among public health experts, microbiologists and clinicians. Throat swab specimens were obtained from children who were admitted to the pediatric outpatient clinics, in Dr. Sami Ulus Obstectrics, Children Health and Diseases Educational and Research Hospital, with upper respiratory tract infections between 1 February 2016-22 March 2016. The specimens were inoculated in 5% sheep blood agar plates. The plates that were incubated in appropriate conditions, were evaluated for Group A beta hemolytic streptococcocci. Subsequently, culture plates were sent to the Public Health Institution of Turkey, National Respiratory Pathologens Reference Laboratories for the investigation of the presence of C.diphtheriae, C.ulcerans and C.pseudotuberculosis. The growth in each plate were collected with a sterile swab and inoculated in tryptic soy broth. Following 2 hours of incubation at 37oC, subcultures were inoculated in cystine-tellurite-blood agar (CTBA) and 5% sheep-blood agar plates; after an overnight incubation tellurite-reducing colonies were inoculated in Tinsdale agar plates. The suspected colonies with positive cystinase activity were identified by conventional methods and also with Coryne API (Biomerieux, France) systems. Toxicity tests (ELEK, PCR) were performed to investigate whether the C.diphtheriae strains were producing toxins. A total of 500 patients were involved in the study. Of these 260 (52%) were girls and 240 (48%) were boys with a mean age of 76 (range, 21-213) months. All patients except one were fully vaccinated with boosters. Most common presenting symptoms of the patients were fever (19.8%), sore throat (52.6%), cough (49.2%), tonsillar hyperemia (97.6%), presence of crypt (24.6%), and membrane over tonsils (1%). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcocci were detected in the throat swab cultures of 66 (%13.2) patients. Genotypically toxin negative C.diphtheriae biovar gravis was identified in the throat swab cultures of 3 patients (2 girls and 1 boy). The tonsils were hyperemic and hypertrophic in all the patients with C.diphtheriae biovar gravis. C.ulcerans and C.pseudotuberculosis were detected in none of the patients.

However, the disease has still not been eradicated and continues to occur in all of Europe.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and World Health Organization have called for European Union-wide solutions to this DAT-shortage. In order to illustrate the importance of these efforts and underline the need for continued diphtheria surveillance, we present data on all registered cases of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis in Belgium during the past decade, up to and including 2017."

Diphtheria is generally an acute respiratory infection, characterized by the formation of a pseudomembrane in the throat, but cutaneous infections are possible. Systemic effects, such as myocarditis and neuropathy, which are associated with increased fatality risk, are due to diphtheria toxin, an exotoxin produced by the pathogen that inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death. Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by the isolation and identification of the causative Corynebacterium spp., usually by bacterial culture followed by enzymatic and toxin detection tests. Diphtheria can be treated with the timely administration of diphtheria antitoxin and antimicrobial therapy. Although effective vaccines are available, this disease has the potential to re-emerge in countries where the recommended vaccination programmes are not sustained, and increasing proportions of adults are becoming susceptible to diphtheria. Thousands of diphtheria cases are still reported annually from several countries in Asia and Africa, along with many outbreaks. Changes in the epidemiology of diphtheria have been reported worldwide. The prevalence of toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. highlights the need for proper clinical and epidemiological investigations to quickly identify and treat affected individuals, along with public health measures to prevent and contain the spread of this disease."

Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological information for toxigenic cases between 2009 and 2017 are described in this population-based prospective surveillance study.ResultsThere were 33 toxigenic cases of diphtheria aged 4 to 82 years. Causative species were C. diphtheriae (n = 18) and C. ulcerans (n = 15). Most C. diphtheriae cases were cutaneous (14/18) while more than half of C. ulcerans cases had respiratory presentations (8/15). Two thirds (23/33) of cases were inadequately immunised. Two cases with C. ulcerans infections died, both inadequately immunised. The major risk factor for C. diphtheriae aquisition was travel to an endemic area and for C. ulcerans, contact with a companion animal. Most confirmed C. diphtheriae or C. ulcerans isolates (441/507; 87%) submitted for toxigenicity testing were non-toxigenic, however, toxin positivity rates were higher (15/23) for C. ulcerans than C. diphtheriae (18/469).

Here we report the first case of C. striatum infection in a solid organ transplant recipient. Three years after heart transplantation, a 58-year-old man developed bilateral pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. He did not improve with levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and heparin treatment. A homogeneous population of abundant gram-positive rods was repeatedly demonstrated in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and C. striatum was grown in pure culture. The isolate was unusual for its multidrug-resistant (MDR) antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The pneumonia resolved with 4 weeks of vancomycin therapy, in combination with rifampin given only during the first 2 weeks of treatment. The isolation of coryneforms (""diphtheroids"") is often attributed to contamination. Their abundant presence on direct examination of specimens and/or their growth in pure culture suggest a pathogenic role, however, and indicate the need for accurate microbiological identification, particularly in immunocompromised hosts who have been hospitalized and previously treated with antibiotics.

The study focuses on patients with VAP post-cardiac surgery at the Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery between April 2nd 2002 and August 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after June 14th, 2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). The isolates with clinical significance (&gt; or = 106 CFU/mL) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. RESULTS: Among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with VAP through the clinical pulmonary infection score &gt; or = 6. The 9 most common pathogens in VAP etiology were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, Acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, Candida albicans 9.53%, while Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, Pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each.

Respiratory samples were recovered from hospitalised patients who were diagnosed of pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic respiratory infections. The samples were Gram-stained and seeded on conventional bacterial growing media. Bacteria were identified by matrix-assisted linear desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method. All patients presented an acute respiratory onset, most of them in the context of an underlying disease and/or immunosuppression. In all patients, the microscopical examination of Gram-stained respiratory samples showed numerous polymorphonuclear cells and Gram-positive bacilli, suggestive of the Corynebacterium morphotype. A pure culture growth of Corynebacterium was obtained in the majority (72 %) of samples. The conclusions are that non-diphtheriae Corynebacterium species are an emerging cause of respiratory infection among patients with chronic respiratory disease and/or immunosuppression, and cannot always be considered as mere colonisers. The microorganism's predominance in Gram-stained purulent respiratory samples together with abundant growth in the culture is the key for the microbiological diagnosis."

There is little evidence about patterns of respiratory infection, transmission and adaptive ability of this pathogen. Seventy-two C. striatum isolates from 51 advanced respiratory patients, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were studied during 38 months. Patients were 74.8 +- 8.6 years old and 81.9% were men, who had required an average of 2.2 hospitalizations and 63.5 days in the hospital in the previous year. Of 49 isolates from 42 patients we were able to identify 12 clones by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), nine phenotypic variants and 22 antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and we determined their clinical and epidemiological determinants. MLSA allows identification of the existence of nosocomial outbreaks by transmission of the same or different clones, the persistence of the same clone in the environment or in patient airways for months. The study showed the high variability and adaptive capacity of the isolates, the antibiotic multidrug-resistance in all of them, and their contribution to a high morbidity and mortality (41%) during the study period.

METHODS: Fourty-five strains of Corynebacterium striatum isolated from different sites of inpatients from November, 2013 to March, 2014 in Affiliated hospital of Inner Mongolian medical university, and microdilution method was employed to do in vitro antibiotics susceptibility test. Saline-cotton swab method was used to sample the surrounding environmental surfaces for Corynebacterium striatum carrying patients, and suspected colonies were further identified and in vitro drug susceptibility test were performed. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis(PFGE) method was used to do molecular typing for 41 isolates of Corynebacterium striatum. RESULTS: Fourty-five isolates of Corynebacterium striatum strains were mainly isolated from neurosurgical unit(21 isolates), respiratory unit(8 isolates) and intensive care unit(8 isolates), 39 isolates of which were isolated from lower respiratory tract. The 45 isolates presented an aggregate distribution in the following 3 months, which were December 2013, January 2014 and February 2014.In vitro antibiotics susceptibility test showed that MIC90 for penecillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin were 64 microg/ml or higher and the MIC90 for gentamicin, vancomycin and rifampicin were all 0.5 microg/ml. Only one isolate was sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested, except clindamycin. PFGE typing results showed that 41 isolates were divided into 7 genotypes, among which 0002 type and 0006 type were the predominant types and accounted for 63% (26/41) and 22% (9/41), respectively. The isolates from different patients showed high homology, which were isolated from the same unit during the same periods.For surrounding surfaces sampling, Corynebacterium striatum isolating rate was 40% (8/20). The isolates from environmental surfaces and those from the corresponding patients showed identical drug susceptibility profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium striatum isolated from inpatients show multi-drug resistant profile, and different isolates from different patients are highly homologous. Specific units, such as neurosurgery unit, respiratory unit and intensive care unit, should reevaluate the clinical significance of Corynebacterium striatum and its relationship with clinical treatment measures supplemented."

Reasons for this include the prolonged survival of severely ill and immunocompromised patients, the development of more invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the sub-optimal use of antibiotics that disrupts normal microbial balance and favors superinfections. CASE REPORT: We present a rare case of sepsis due to multidrug-resistant Corynebacterium striatum in a 76-year-old host. The patient suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome and was on corticosteroid treatment due to atopic dermatitis. He had, also, a recent hospital admission and received a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics due to lower respiratory infection. The patient responded neither to empiric nor to targeted treatment and finally succumbed. CONCLUSION: Diphtheroids are emerging pathogens capable of causing severe opportunistic infections. Their multidrugresistant nature renders treatment problematic and poses a threat to the currently established antimicrobial stewardship programs. Hippokratia 2016, 20(1): 67-69."

METHODOLOGY: During a 14-month period, Corynebacterium striatum strains were routinely isolated in lower respiratory tract samples of the inpatients in a tertiary hospital in China, and the suspected isolates were identified with VITEK-2 ANC card and 16S rRNA sequencing technique, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was employed to discriminate different clones, and biofilm-producing abilities of different strains were compared. RESULTS: A total of 82 strains of Corynebacterium striatum were mainly isolated from neurosurgery patients (45.1%, 37/82). Three epidemic clones (type D, F, and I) were identified, accounting for 82.9% (68/82) of strains. All 82 C. striatum strains were all sensitive to vancomycin, and resistant to ceftriaxone, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. One week before C. striatum isolation, 89.0% (73/82) patients showed lower levels of hemoglobin, 93.9% (77/82) of patients received treatment of several kinds of antibiotics, and 41.5% (34/82) patients with glucocorticoid, and 46.3% (38/82) of patients showed disturbed consciousness at different levels. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium striatum strains isolated during this study were mainly multidrug resistant, and the predominant clones could rapidly transmit among susceptible inpatients. Corynebacterium striatum seems to be an important pathogen for patients with specific risk factors, especially for the ones with lower hemoglobin levels who are being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics."

The objective of these studies was to provide a detailed genomic analysis of disease-causing C. striatum and determine the genomic drivers of resistance and resistance-gene transmission. METHODS: A multi-institutional and prospective pathogen genomics programme flagged seven MDR C. striatum infections occurring close in time, and specifically in immunocompromised patients with underlying respiratory diseases. Whole genome sequencing was used to identify clonal relationships among strains, genetic causes of antimicrobial resistance, and their mobilization capacity. Matrix-assisted linear desorption/ionization-time-of-flight analyses of sequenced isolates provided curated content to improve rapid clinical identification in subsequent cases. RESULTS: Epidemiological and genomic analyses identified a related cluster of three out of seven C. striatum among lung transplant patients who had common procedures and exposures at an outlying institution. Genomic analyses further elucidated drivers of the MDR phenotypes, including resistance genes mobilized by IS3504 and ISCg9a-like insertion sequences. Seven mobilizable resistance genes were localized to a common chromosomal region bounded by unpaired insertion sequences, suggesting that a single recombination event could spread resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and tetracyclines to naive strains. CONCLUSION: In-depth genomic studies of MDR C. striatum reveal its capacity for clonal spread within and across healthcare institutions and identify novel vectors that can mobilize multiple forms of drug resistance, further complicating efforts to treat infections in immunocompromised populations."

In recent years, Corynebacterium striatum has emerged as a multi-drug resistant human pathogen which can cause nosocomial outbreaks. The organism has infrequently been noted to cause respiratory infections. A retrospective study was conducted to identify the clinical and microbiological features of respiratory infection by Corynebacterium striatum. METHODOLOGY: C. striatum isolates from clinical and surveillance samples were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobials and typed by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Clinical data was obtained through a retrospective review of records. RESULTS: 15 isolates from clinical and surveillance samples of 11 hospitalised patients were included. The patients suffered from either an exacerbation of COPD (n = 9) or pneumonia (n = 2). The isolates were all multi-drug resistant. RAPD typing found no evidence of an outbreak/ transmission between patients. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium spp. must be considered potential pathogens. Suspicious isolates should be identified to the species level since Corynebacterium striatum is often multi-drug resistant."

However, C. striatum meningitis combined with multiple abscesses has not been published before. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe the clinical and imaging findings in a 54-year-old woman with meningitis caused by C. striatum and combined with suspected brain and lung abscesses. This patient who underwent multiple fractures and a recent cut presented with headache and paraphasia. C. striatum was isolated in cerebrospinal fluid and supposedly transmitted from the skin purulent wound through blood. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin and had a transient improvement, but died finally. Multiple abscesses, especially in the brain, could be a reason to explain her conditions were deteriorating rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Note that C. striatum can cause life-threatening infections. Early identification and diagnosis, early administration of antibiotics to which the bacterium is susceptible, and treatment of complications will be beneficial in patients with C. striatum-related infection."

Isolation of MDR C. striatum as the only organism from respiratory samples from hospitalized patients is increasing in China. AIM: To elucidate the genomic epidemiology and evolution of C. striatum in China. METHODS: 260 isolates from 2016 to 2018 were collected from three hospitals in three regions of China. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed on all isolates. Whole genome sequencing was applied to all isolates to assess their genomic diversity and relationships and detect the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) and ARG cassettes. FINDINGS: Nearly all isolates (96.2%, 250/260) showed multidrug-resistance. Genome sequencing revealed four major lineages with lineage IV emerging as the epidemic lineage. Most of the diversity was developed in the last six years. Each hospital has its own predominant clones with potential spread between Hebei and Guangdong hospitals. Genomic analysis further revealed multiple ARGs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that four lineages of C. striatum have spread in parallel across China, causing persistent and extensive transmissions within hospitals. MDR C. striatum infection has become a national epidemic. Antibiotic-driven selection pressure may have played significant roles in forming persistent and predominant clones. Our data provide the basis for surveillance and prevention strategies to control the epidemic caused by MDR C. striatum."

C. ulcerans strains producing phospholipase D, but not diphtheria toxin, are able to cause severe disease in humans, such as pneumonia and granulomatous nodules in pulmonary tissues. The infection rate varies really widely by region, probably because of the variations in the reported infection rates. Dogs with unapparent C. ulcerans infections may be considered as potentially capable of infecting other animals and humans, including pet owners. Medical and veterinary staff should be aware that asymptomatic animals can carry C. ulcerans and cooperate in eliminating infections and monitoring animals also in the developing countries."

In this report, we undertook the epidemiological and molecular characterization of all toxigenic corynebacterium strains isolated in England between January 2007 and December 2013. Epidemiological aspects include case demographics, risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome. Molecular characterization was performed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alongside traditional phenotypic methods. In total, there were 20 cases of toxigenic corynebacteria; 12 (60.0%) were caused by Corynebacterium ulcerans, where animal contact was the predominant risk factor. The remaining eight (40.0%) were caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains; six were biovar mitis, which were associated with recent travel abroad. Adults 45 years and older were particularly affected (55.0%; 11/20), and typical symptoms included sore throat and fever. Respiratory diphtheria with the absence of a pharyngeal membrane was the most common presentation (50.0%; 10/20). None of the eight C. diphtheriae cases were fully immunized. Diphtheria antitoxin was issued in two (9.5%) cases; both survived. Two (9.5%) cases died, one due to a C. diphtheriae infection and one due to C. ulcerans. MLST demonstrated that the majority (87.5%; 7/8) of C. diphtheriae strains represented new sequence types (STs). By adapting several primer sequences, the MLST genes in C. ulcerans were also amplified, thereby providing the basis for extension of the MLST scheme, which is currently restricted to C. diphtheriae. Despite high population immunity, occasional toxigenic corynebacterium strains are identified in England and continued surveillance is required. "

Diphtheria vaccine does not provide protection against asymptomatic carriage and colonization of non-toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is a known fact that invasive infections may arise from non-toxigenic C.diphtheriae strains that the non-toxigenic strains can become toxigenic strains leading to diphteria. It is also known that there is a risk of diphteria outbreaks due to decreased antitoxin level and inadequate adult immunization programs. In our country, there is no routine surveillance of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C.diphtheriae. In the present study we aimed to investigate the presence of C.diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in children presenting with the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections that might be confused with those moderate diphteria, in order to highlight the requirement of microbiological surveillance and to create awareness about these microorganisms among public health experts, microbiologists and clinicians. Throat swab specimens were obtained from children who were admitted to the pediatric outpatient clinics, in Dr. Sami Ulus Obstectrics, Children Health and Diseases Educational and Research Hospital, with upper respiratory tract infections between 1 February 2016-22 March 2016. The specimens were inoculated in 5% sheep blood agar plates. The plates that were incubated in appropriate conditions, were evaluated for Group A beta hemolytic streptococcocci. Subsequently, culture plates were sent to the Public Health Institution of Turkey, National Respiratory Pathologens Reference Laboratories for the investigation of the presence of C.diphtheriae, C.ulcerans and C.pseudotuberculosis. The growth in each plate were collected with a sterile swab and inoculated in tryptic soy broth. Following 2 hours of incubation at 37oC, subcultures were inoculated in cystine-tellurite-blood agar (CTBA) and 5% sheep-blood agar plates; after an overnight incubation tellurite-reducing colonies were inoculated in Tinsdale agar plates. The suspected colonies with positive cystinase activity were identified by conventional methods and also with Coryne API (Biomerieux, France) systems. Toxicity tests (ELEK, PCR) were performed to investigate whether the C.diphtheriae strains were producing toxins. A total of 500 patients were involved in the study. Of these 260 (52%) were girls and 240 (48%) were boys with a mean age of 76 (range, 21-213) months. All patients except one were fully vaccinated with boosters. Most common presenting symptoms of the patients were fever (19.8%), sore throat (52.6%), cough (49.2%), tonsillar hyperemia (97.6%), presence of crypt (24.6%), and membrane over tonsils (1%). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcocci were detected in the throat swab cultures of 66 (%13.2) patients. Genotypically toxin negative C.diphtheriae biovar gravis was identified in the throat swab cultures of 3 patients (2 girls and 1 boy). The tonsils were hyperemic and hypertrophic in all the patients with C.diphtheriae biovar gravis. C.ulcerans and C.pseudotuberculosis were detected in none of the patients.

Two studies to determine C. ulcerans prevalence rates were undertaken: (a) a prospective study of nasal samples from healthy animals, 479 dogs and 72 cats; (b) a retrospective analysis of records of nasal samples collected over a 10-year period from 189 dogs and 64 cats affected by respiratory signs. RESULTS: Toxigenic C. ulcerans was isolated from four cats with nasal discharge while concurrent C. ulcerans and mecC methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection was detected in a dog suffering from chronic nasal discharge. Clinical features were not distinctive and all cases recovered following antimicrobial treatment. Multilocus sequence typing supported a common source for isolates from the shelter cats. Carriage rates of C. ulcerans in healthy animals were 0.42% (2/479) in dogs and 0.00% (0/72) in cats whereas in animals with signs of upper respiratory tract infection prevalence rates were 0.53% (1/189) in dogs and 6.25% (4/64) in cats.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory diphtheria is a toxin-mediated disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria-like illness, clinically indistinguishable from diphtheria, is caused by C. ulcerans, a zoonotic bacterium that can also produce diphtheria toxin. In the United States, respiratory diphtheria is nationally notifiable: specimens from suspected cases are submitted to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for species and toxin confirmation, and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is obtained from CDC for treatment. We summarize the epidemiology of respiratory diphtheria and diphtheria-like illness and describe DAT use during 1996-2018 in the United States. METHODS: We described respiratory diphtheria cases reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness identified through specimen submissions to CDC during 1996-2018. We reviewed DAT requests from 1997-2018. RESULTS: From 1996-2018, 14 respiratory diphtheria cases were reported to NNDSS. Among these 14 cases, 1 was toxigenic and 3 were non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae by culture and Elek, 6 were culture-negative but PCR-positive for diphtheria toxin gene, 1 was culture-positive without further testing, and the remaining 3 were either not tested or tested negative. Five cases of respiratory diphtheria-like illness caused by toxigenic C. ulcerans were identified. DAT was requested by healthcare providers for 151 suspected diphtheria cases between 1997-2018, with an average of 11 requests per year from 1997-2007, and 3 per year from 2008-2018. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory diphtheria remains rare in the United States, and requests for DAT have declined. Incidental identification of C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness suggests surveillance of this condition might be warranted."

Four cases of congenital listeriosis have been diagnosed. Some mothers presented with ""flu-like"" symptoms. All mothers delivered prematurely (29 hbd - 32 hbd). Among the 4 infants the most common clinical features were: perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress, pathological icterus, haematologic abnormalities. Septicemia occurred in 50% of cases; pneumonia in 100%. Three of them presented skin manifestations; one of the neonates had mucosal abnormalities of the laryngopharynx. Cerebral sonography showed intracranial hemorrhage. One of the infants died within 7 days of birth. The other two neonates developed posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Only one infant has normal development. Although listeriosis appears to be not a frequent cause of perinatal infection, clinicians must be aware of Listeria, particularly in gravid patients who present with fever and ""flu-like"" illness and go into premature labour. Initial therapy implemented in our Department, with ampicillin and aminoglycosides seem to be the most appropriate."

It differs from the common meningitis pathogens in its clinical features and treatment. CLINICAL PICTURE: We present 2 recently encountered cases of Listeria meningoencephalitis. In case 1, a previously healthy 42-year-old man presented with clinical features of meningoencephalitis. In case 2, a 64-year-old woman had clinical features of pneumonia and meningoencephalitis. Both had a predominantly lymphocytic picture in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Listeria grew in blood cultures of both patients and the CSF culture of the first. TREATMENT: In both cases, Listeria was resistant to the empirical antibiotics used. Intravenous ampicillin was eventually used in both patients, with gentamicin, added for synergistic action in the first. OUTCOME: The first patient developed complications of hydrocephalus, subdural collection and extensive cerebritis and ventriculitis. The second patient had focal seizures and a pontine infarct. Both did not survive. CONCLUSION: These 2 recent cases with different presentations of intracranial listerosis highlight the increasing importance of listerial infections in Singapore. Clinicians need to be familiar with the features of this lethal disease in order to recognize and manage it successfully."

Involvement of the latter bacteria and association of two different pathogens are both highly uncommon features in pneumonia. The route of infection with L. monocytogenes is discussed and the literature on respiratory infections with L. monocytogenes is briefly reviewed.

A chest X-ray revealed an infiltrate in the left lower lobe; the cerebrospinal fluid was cloudy with a mild pleocytosis. Ceftriaxone was prescribed and the fever subsided. On the second day of admission she had a seizure, and a paraparesis emerged. Despite changes in the antibiotic regimen, her clinical condition hardly improved. On the fifth day, antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae were found to be strongly positive and the diagnosis was M. pneumoniae infection. This accounted for the pneumonia together with meningoencephalitis and a transverse myelitis. The antibiotics were switched to doxycycline and the clinical condition improved dramatically. Six weeks after discharge, the patient had made a complete recovery. In patients suffering from meningitis with an atypical presentation, uncommon causes of infection should be considered.

During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged &gt;or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged &gt;or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged &gt;or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients."

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was a prospective nationwide observational cohort study including patients aged &gt;16 years who had bacterial meningitis confirmed by culture of cerebrospinal fluid (696 episodes of bacterial meningitis occurring in 671 patients). Alcoholism was present in 27 of 686 recorded episodes of bacterial meningitis (4%) and alcoholics were more often male than non-alcoholics (82% vs 48%, P = 0.001). A higher proportion of alcoholics had underlying pneumonia (41% vs 11% P&lt;0.001). Alcoholics were more likely to have meningitis due to infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (70% vs 50%, P = 0.01) and Listeria monocytogenes (19% vs 4%, P = 0.005), whereas Neisseria meningitidis was more common in non-alcoholic patients (39% vs 4%, P = 0.01). A large proportion of alcoholics developed complications during clinical course (82% vs 62%, as compared with non-alcoholics; P = 0.04), often cardiorespiratory failure (52% vs 28%, as compared with non-alcoholics; P = 0.01). Alcoholic patients were at risk for unfavourable outcome (67% vs 33%, as compared with non-alcoholics; P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Alcoholic patients are at high risk for complications resulting in high morbidity and mortality.

The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of etiological agents and their relationship with clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in this cohort of patients with CABM. METHODS: Our retrospective chart review analyzed the causative microorganisms, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes of 159 adults with CABM hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Centre of Vilnius University Hospital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. A Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score <= 3 was defined as unfavorable outcome. Predictors of an unfavorable outcome were identified through logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median patient age was 36 (IQR 24-56), and 51.6% were male. Microbiologically confirmed causative agents were identified in 80 (50.3%) patients: N. meningitidis in 55 (34.6%) patients with serotype B accounting for 85% of cases, S. pneumoniae in 15 (9.4%), L. monocytogenes in 5 (3.1%) and other in 5 (3.1%). The clinical triad of fever, neck stiffness and a change in mental status was present in 59.1% of patients. Coexisting conditions and comorbidities were similar in all groups stratified by etiology. Initial antimicrobial treatment consisted of penicillin in 78 patients (49.1%) and ceftriaxone in 72 patients (45.3%). The median time in which antibiotic treatment was started was 40 min (IQR 30.0-90.0). The outcome was unfavorable in 15.7% of episodes and death occurred in 5.7% of cases and did not differ according to the causative agent. Risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were age > 65 years, coexisting pneumonia and a platelet count <150x10e9/l. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative agent of CABM was N. meningitidis, with serotype B clearly dominant. Causative agents did not influence the disease outcome. The strongest risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were older age, pneumonia and a low platelet count. Since the introduction of routine vaccination against meningococcus B for infants in Lithuania in 2018, the national vaccination policy may hopefully contribute to a decrease in the incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease in the Lithuanian population."

",SPECIES:Listeria monocytogenesID:3670948TITLE:Clinical manifestations of epidemic neonatal listeriosis.ABSTRACT:We report the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations in 23 infants with positive cultures for Listeria monocytogenes who were treated in our hospital during a recent epidemic. The majority of infants (70%) were preterm and none was small for gestational age. Thirteen (56%) had respiratory distress at birth with evidence of congenital pneumonia. Four of the 5 deaths occurred among these infants. Four infants considered healthy after resuscitation developed fever and lethargy within 36 hours after birth. Only one of these infants had evidence of pneumonia. We conclude that congenital pneumonia with respiratory distress at birth is the major cause of mortality and morbidity from L. monocytogenes infection in the neonate.

Investigation of this outbreak established that the first four cases wer close contacts, all infected by Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1b. The source of infection and route of spread were not identified. A total of 102 renal transplant recipients with listeriosis have now been reported. The major manifestation of disease was meningitis in 50% of the patients, parenchymal disease of the central nervous system in 10%, both meningitis and parenchymal disease of the central nervous system in 9%, and primary bacteremia in 30%. The overall mortality rate was 26%. Pneumonia due to L. monocytogenes, a previously neglected finding, was present in seven patients (7%); five of the seven died. The route of transmission may sometimes be respiratory. Special techniques for isolation of L. monocytogenes from sputum are usually required but not complicated. We recommend that individual renal transplant patients with listeriosis be cared for with secretion and excretion precautions and that they be treated with ampicillin and gentamicin. We advocate the serotyping of all isolates and a careful case-control analysis of all epidemics, but we do not support the use of serologic testing or surveillance cultures."

DESIGN: Patient series. SETTING: ECMO referral centers. PARTICIPANTS: The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry database of patients supported with ECMO between 1975 and 1991. INTERVENTION: ECMO. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Nine neonates were identified who were supported with ECMO for severe respiratory failure associated with L monocytogenes infection. Microbiologic studies demonstrated L monocytogenes organisms in the blood of all infants, and pneumonia was diagnosed by roentgenogram and/or isolation of L monocytogenes organisms in tracheobronchial secretions. All infants experienced progressive respiratory deterioration by age 36 hours and were placed on venoarterial bypass by 96 hours, having met institution-based criteria predictive of 80% to 90% mortality. The duration of ECMO for patients with Listeria infection (median, 210 hours; range, 137 to 454 hours) was prolonged compared with the duration of ECMO for neonates in all other registry diagnostic categories (median, 114 hours; range, 1 to 744 hours; N = 5146, P = .035). Six of the nine infants recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ECMO is efficacious in patients with severe respiratory failure secondary to Listeria sepsis. Prolonged time on bypass should be expected when Listeria sepsis is associated with severe necrotizing pneumonia."

","SPECIES:Listeria monocytogenesID:8601544TITLE:Bacterial complications of transplantation: diagnosis and treatment.ABSTRACT:Bacterial complications develop mainly after transplantation during the period before engraftment takes place. Wound infections, urinary tract infection and pneumonia are the commonest complications of solid organ transplantation and generally involve Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. However, Gram-positive cocci will predominate when selective oral antimicrobial prophylaxis is given as is frequently the case in bone marrow transplant recipients. Oromucositis, induced by total body irradiation or anthracyclines, result in more bacteraemia due to oral viridans streptococci. The use of central intravenous catheters leads to an increase in bacteraemia and infection due to coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients requiring intensive care are also at risk of nosocomial infections including legionellosis. Once engraftment has occurred, there is much less risk of bacterial infection but patients remain vulnerable to the intracellular pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoid salmonellae, Norcardia spp. and mycobacteria for as long as they require immunosuppression. Any rejection crisis must be treated aggressively with high-dose steroids or other agents which further undermine an already fragile immunity. In bone marrow transplant recipients, graft versus host disease and its treatment exerts a more profound effect on immunity and often coincides with cytomegalovirus infection which compromises the patient even further. Such patients are again at risk of infection with the same range of pathogens encountered during neutropenia since the oral mucosa, gut and catheter, if one is present, provide the same portals of entry. Immunosuppressive therapy, in some centres, is discontinued once the risk of graft versus host disease is reduced, although the reconstitution of the immune system is a lengthy process and there is a continued deficiency of IgG which renders patients unable to opsonise the encapsulated bacteria Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae. In contrast to bone marrow transplant recipients, those with a solid organ transplant require life-long immunosuppression and so remain susceptible to infections with intracellular pathogens and, even with minimal immunosuppression, there will always be the risk that common bacteria will cause infection in unusual places and that uncommon organisms will be involved in apparently straightforward infections."

","SPECIES:Listeria monocytogenesID:9722468TITLE:Antibiotic use in neonatal sepsis.ABSTRACT:Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening emergency and any delay in treatment may cause death. Initial signs of neonatal sepsis are slight and nonspecific. Therefore, in suspected sepsis, two or three days empirical antibiotic therapy should begin immediately after cultures have been obtained without awaiting the results. Antibiotics should be reevaluated when the results of the cultures and susceptibility tests are available. If the cultures are negative and the clinical findings are well, antibiotics should be stopped. Because of the nonspecific nature of neonatal sepsis, especially in small preterm infants, physicians continue antibiotics once started. If a baby has pneumonia or what appears to be sepsis, antibiotics should not be stopped, although cultures are negative. The duration of therapy depends on the initial response to the appropriate antibiotics but should be 10 to 14 days in most infants with sepsis and minimal or absent focal infection. In infants who developed sepsis during the first week of life, empirical therapy must cover group B streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae (especially E. coli) and Listeria monocytogenes. Penicillin or ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside is usually effective against all these organisms. Initial empirical antibiotic therapy for infants who developed sepsis beyond the first days of life must cover the organisms associated with early-onset sepsis as well as hospital-acquired pathogens such as staphylococci, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Penicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside combination may also be used in the initial therapy of late-onset sepsis as in cases with early-onset sepsis. In nosocomial infections, netilmicin or amikacin should be preferred. In cases showing increased risk of staphylococcal infection (e.g. presence of vascular catheter) or Pseudomonas infection (e.g. presence of typical skin lesions), antistaphylococcal or anti-Pseudomonas agents may be preferred in the initial empirical therapy. In some centers, third-generation cephalosporins in combinations with penicillin or ampicillin have been used in the initial therapy of early-onset and late-onset neonatal sepsis. Third-generation cephalosporin may also be combined with an aminoglycoside in places where aminoglycoside-resistance to this antibiotic is high. However, third-generation cephalosporins should not be used in the initial therapy of suspected sepsis, because 1) extensive use of cephalosporins for initial therapy of neonatal sepsis may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms (this has occurred more rapidly as compared with the aminoglycosides), 2) Antagonistic interactions have been demonstrated when the other beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins) were combined with cephalosporins. Infections due to gram-negative bacilli can be treated with the combination of a penicillin-derivative (ampicillin or extended-spectrum penicillins) and an aminoglycoside. Third-generation cephalosporins in combination with an aminoglycoside or an extended-spectrum penicillin have been used in the treatment of sepsis due to these organisms. Piperacillin and azlocillin are the most active of extended-spectrum penicillins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the third-generation cephalosporins, cefoperazone and ceftazidime possess anti-Pseudomonas activity. Ceftazidime was found to be more active in vitro against Pseudomonas than cefoperazone or piperacillin. New antibiotics for gram-negative bacteria resistant to other agents are carbapenems, aztreonam, quinolones and isepamicin. Enterococci can be treated with a cell wall-active agent (e.g. penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside. Staphylococci are susceptible to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (e.g. oxacillin, nafcillin and methicillin). Resistant strains are uniformly sensitive to vancomycin. A penicillin or vancomycin and an aminoglycoside combination result in a more rapid bacteriocidal effect than is produced by either dr"

However, it increases the risk of tuberculosis. Less is known about the development of Mycobacterium other than tuberculosis (MOTT) infection. We review the literature on non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in infliximab-treated patients and report the first case of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex in an infliximab-treated patient complicated by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE search with the keywords mycobacteria and infliximab revealed four cases of MOTT in patients treated with infliximab: fatal Mycobacterium peregrinum pneumonia in a patient with polymyositis and dermatomyositis; a patient with rheumatoid arthritis with skin and soft tissue infection with Mycobacterium abscessus; Mycobacterium fortuitum in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis; and a case of pulmonary MAC without dissemination. Review of US data from 1998 to 2002 published by Wallis et al. revealed that out of more than 233,000 patients treated with infliximab, 30 developed unspecified mycobacterial species infection. No further data was available regarding these cases. CONCLUSION: MOTT infection is a rare but emerging complication of infliximab therapy. MOTT cases tend to progress rapidly in infliximab-treated patients and withdrawal of infliximab therapy can result in immune reconstitution."

We evaluated the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of 23 patients with NTM lung diseases who had underwent pulmonary resection. The median age of the patients was 45 yr. Of the 23 patients, 10 had Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infection, 12 had M. abscessus infection, and one had M. xenopi infection. The indications for surgery were antibiotic therapy failure (n=11), remnant cavitary lesion with high probability of relapse (n=8), and massive hemoptysis (n=4). The most common procedure was lobectomy (48%). Postoperative complications occurred in eight patients (35%), including postoperative pneumonia (n=3) and late bronchopleural fistula (n=2). Negative sputum culture conversion was achieved and maintained in all except two mortalities. Although it is associated with a relatively high complication rate, patients with NTM lung disease whose disease is localized to one lung and who can tolerate resectional surgery might be considered for surgery, if there has been poor response to drug therapy or if the patients develop significant disease-related complications such as hemoptysis."

Nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases could legitimately be seen as an emerging public-health threat. RECENT FINDINGS: Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease associated radiographically with nodules and bronchiectasis occurs primarily in women. These patients are associated with a specific morphotype, including low BMI, tall stature, scoliosis, pectus excavatum and mitral valve prolapse. The pathophysiologic link between these findings and the development of bronchiectasis and NTM disease remains unclear. As with tuberculosis, the tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers also predispose to NTM infection that can be severe. The most frustrating aspect of NTM therapy remains the generally poor correlation between in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility and in-vivo response to antimicrobials. A possible insight into this phenomenon is the recent discovery of an inducible macrolide resistance (erm) gene in Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium abscessus. This gene can produce in-vivo resistance without resulting in a 'resistant' MIC for macrolides. SUMMARY: The NTM pose an increasing problem for clinicians and are associated with significant obstacles that thwart successful treatment of NTM disease. Continued progress in the areas of disease pathogenesis and therapy will improve the outlook for these patients."

However, NTM are a heterogeneous group and most of the data come from only three species: Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus. Still, information about these three species is confusing because it is based mainly on retrospective studies and series of clinical cases performed in developed countries. In recent years, new information has appeared about other species and the pathogenesis of NTM. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that NTM infection is a worldwide phenomenon with an increasing presence in developing countries perhaps because of the implementation of tap water. Women with characteristic phenotype are at higher risk of acquiring NTM infection along with patients with defects on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. New studies on Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium szulgai and Mycobacterium simiae indicate that the American Thoracic Society criteria for diagnosing NTM disease may not be useful for all species of NTM.

M. abscessus isolates were obtained from 35 patients in the RCW of hospital A, 6 patients in the RCWs of another three hospitals (B, C and D), and from 4 water sources in two of the hospitals (A and B). Strains were characterized by methods including hsp65 PCR-RFLP and PFGE. The patients were followed-up by chest X-ray for 1 year. All clinical isolates were type I and II, and belonged to ten distinct clusters of PFGE patterns. Five clinical strains in two hospitals belonged to a single cluster, whilst four clinical strains in the other two hospitals belonged to a single unique cluster. The strains from hospital A fell into nine clusters and were distinct from the strains isolated from the water supply. Patients infected with type I strains showed a significantly more rapid progression of disease. The number of different strains involved suggested either that there had been a polyclonal outbreak or that a high level of endemic infections was present in the RCW of hospital A. This and the lack of homology between the clinical and environmental isolates from hospital A raised the possibility that pulmonary M. abscessus infections may have been spread by the movement of patients between RCWs, a routine practice in Taiwan's integrated delivery system."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study (2001-2008) including all patients who met American Thoracic Society criteria for M. abscessus pulmonary disease. Our aim was the evaluation of clinical and microbiologic outcomes in patients treated with combined antibiotic and surgical therapy, compared with antibiotic therapy alone. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were predominantly female (83%) and never-smokers (60%), with a mean age of 60 years. Fifty-nine (55%) of 107 patients had coexistent or previous history of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary infection. High-resolution chest CT showed bronchiectasis and nodular opacities in 98% of patients and cavities in 44%. Sixty-nine (46 medical, 23 surgical) patients were followed up for a mean duration of 34 months (standard deviation, 21.1 months, range, 2-82 months). Cough, sputum production, and fatigue remained stable, improved, or resolved in 80%, 69%, and 59% of patients, respectively. Twenty (29%) of 69 patients remained culture positive, 16 (23%) converted but experienced relapse, 33 (48%) converted to negative and did not experience relapse, and 17 (16%) died during the study period. There were significantly more surgical patients than medical patients whose culture converted and remained negative for at least 1 year (57% vs 28%; P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with M. abscessus pulmonary disease who are treated with multidrug antibiotic therapy and surgery or antibiotic therapy alone had similar clinical outcomes.

Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia.

However, resistance to clarithromycin was more frequently observed in the M. abscessus than in the M. massiliense group (16% and 4%, respectively; P = 0.145). Moreover, the level of resistance to imipenem was significantly lower in M. abscessus isolates than in M. massiliense isolates (19% and 48%, respectively; P = 0.007). The proportions of radiological improvement, sputum smear conversion to negativity, and negative culture conversion during the follow-up period were higher in patients with M. massiliense infections than in those with M. abscessus infections. Patients with M. massiliense infections responded more favorably to antimicrobial therapy than those with M. abscessus infections."

A 73-year-old female patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had Mycobacterium abscessus bacteremia with manifestations of multiple skin nodules, pneumonia, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy 4 months after the implantation of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for the delivery of chemotherapy. The catheter-related M. abscessus bacteremia was confirmed by positive blood cultures of specimens drawn from a PICC line and a peripheral vein. She defervesced with the administration of meropenem, amikacin, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, and by the removal of PICC. Her fever subsided for 3 months with the disappearance of skin and lung lesions; however, she died of AML relapse. Bacteremia and skin infection caused by M. abscessus can be detected by culture and pathological examinations and should be considered in leukemia patients with a PICC. With appropriate laboratory diagnosis, M. abscessus bacteremia with disseminated infections can improve with catheter removal and combination antimicrobial therapy."

Clinical signs included lethargy, hyporexia, coughing, and bloody respiratory discharge. Diagnostic findings included neutrophilic leukocytosis, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and repeated forceful exhaled breath (sputum) cytology, with acute inflammatory cells and acid-fast positive beaded rods. The bacteria were initially identified free in the sputum sample and subsequently were seen within neutrophils. A culture was positive for a rapidly growing, white, colony-forming organism confirmed as M. abscessus by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Clinical signs initially resolved with multidrug therapy. Concurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection complicated clinical management and contributed to terminal decline. The dolphin was euthanized 5 mo after initial diagnosis. Necropsy results demonstrated acid-fast positive bacteria in lung tissue and supported the diagnosis of M. abscessus pneumonia. Acid-fast stains and mycobacteria cultures should be considered when evaluating ill dolphins."

This study examined household water and shower aerosols of patients with NTM pulmonary disease. The mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples from 20 patients included M. avium (5 patients), M. intracellulare (12 patients), M. abscessus (7 patients), M. gordonae (1 patient), M. lentiflavum (1 patient), M. fortuitum (1 patient), M. peregrinum (1 patient), M. chelonae (1 patient), M. triplex (1 patient), and M. kansasii (1 patient). One-liter water samples and swabs were collected from all taps, and swimming pools or rainwater tanks. Shower aerosols were sampled using Andersen six-stage cascade impactors. For a subgroup of patients, real-time PCR was performed and high-resolution melt profiles were compared to those of ATCC control strains. Pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from 19 homes. Species identified in the home matched that found in the patient in seven (35%) cases: M. abscessus (3 cases), M. avium (1 case), M. gordonae (1 case), M. lentiflavum (1 case), and M. kansasii (1 case). In an additional patient with M. abscessus infection, this species was isolated from potable water supplying her home. NTM grown from aerosols included M. abscessus (3 homes), M. gordonae (2 homes), M. kansasii (1 home), M. fortuitum complex (4 homes), M. mucogenicum (1 home), and M. wolinskyi (1 home). NTM causing human disease can be isolated from household water and aerosols. The evidence appears strongest for M. avium, M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, and M. abscessus. Despite a predominance of disease due to M. intracellulare, we found no evidence for acquisition of infection from household water for this species. "

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium abscessusID:24740640TITLE:Surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.ABSTRACT:While the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been decreasing, the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease has been increasing. Unlike tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is not communicable. However, their indolent nature may result in extensive parenchymal destruction, causing respiratory failure and vulnerability to airway infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, therefore, has been becoming a significant health problem. According to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement on nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, the primary treatment is a multidrug treatment regimen. However, its efficacy is less than satisfactory for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, which is the most common type of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, and for Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease, which is notoriously resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The statement, therefore, has proposed a multidisciplinary treatment approach for these types of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases: a combination of multidrug treatment regimen and adjuvant resectional surgery. This review covers the rationale, indication, procedure, and outcome of surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. The rationale of surgery is to prevent disease progressing by removing the areas of lung most affected, harboring the largest amounts of mycobacteria. The indications for surgery include a poor response to drug therapy, the development of macrolide-resistant disease, or the presence of a significant disease-related complication such as hemoptysis. The surgical procedures of choice are various types of pulmonary resections, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. The reported series have achieved favorable treatment outcomes in surgically treated patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. "

We examined the risk factors associated with treatment outcome in Taiwanese adults with pulmonary disease caused by the M. abscessus complex. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients from a southern Taiwan medical center from 2006 to 2012 who had respiratory specimens identified as M. abscessus complex and met the American Thoracic Society criteria for pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Of the 106 included patients, females (58.5%) and nonsmokers (79.2%) predominated. The mean age of patients was 64.8 years. Sixty-three patients (59.4%) had pre-existing lung disease. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (34.9%) was the most common underlying disorder. Chest radiography indicated that bronchiectasis was common (47.2%) and that cavitations were less common (14.2%). Fifty-six patients received antibiotic treatment. Clinicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics if the initial sputum acid-fast staining was positive (p &lt; 0.001). Treatment outcome was analyzed in 26 patients who were treated for more than 3 months; three of these patients (11.5%) had clinical failure and 18 (69.2%) experienced sputum conversion. Patients with cavitary lesions were more likely to experience microbiologic failure (p = 0.02). Nine patients had positive cultures after antibiotic treatment for &gt; 1 year. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (p = 0.011) and cavitary lesion (p = 0.034) are risk factors for persistence of M. abscessus complex. CONCLUSION: With antimicrobial therapy, previous mycobacterial disease, and cavitary lesion are associated with microbiologic failure in Taiwanese adults with M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease."

Historically, this was due to burn wound sepsis but pneumonia has now emerged as the most common source. In light of the increasing incidence of multi-drug-resistant organisms, the description of rare infections is paramount in continuing the fight against deadly pathogens. We aim to describe the second case of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) reported in a burn patient. Difficulties in diagnosis and management will also be highlighted. METHODS: A 70-y-old Caucasian female, with a past medical history for type 2 diabetes mellitus, was transferred to our facility after a house fire. She had sustained a 28% total body surface area (TBSA) flame burn to her neck, torso, and all four extremities. She underwent excision and grafting on hospital day five with multiple subsequent attempts at excision and grafting due to graft loss. On hospital day 14, a tracheostomy was performed. Her hospital course was complicated by ongoing respiratory failure, renal injury, and sepsis. RESULTS: Mycobacterium abscessus was found on blood cultures from central venous catheters and arterial line catheters as well as on tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on hospital day 86. Imaging then revealed multiple pulmonary nodular densities with patchy ground-glass opacities. After multiple adjustments to the antibiotic regimen, tigecycline, clarithromycin, and cefoxitin therapy was started. She remained on this regimen for almost 4 wks. Her other infections included Acinetobacter baumanii treated with tobramycin and colistin, as well as Candida albicans for which she received fluconazole. Ultimately, her clinical state worsened leading to withdrawal of care. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis NTM is rare in burn patients with only one other case described in the English-language literature. Both cases reflect differences in diagnosis and management. This highlights the need to discuss rare infections in an attempt to broaden the clinician's awareness of such pathogens, as well as to collaborate to form a consensus about their management."

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

We investigated the characteristics and clinical impact of NTM isolation in this population. Medical records of adult patients who underwent SCT at the blood and marrow transplantation center at a University Hospital in South Korea between January 2004 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five of 2,658 patients were enrolled, an incidence of 0.94%. The most common NTM species isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 15) and Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 5). Sixteen patients were co-infected with other pathogens, including Aspergillus species (10 cases). Nonspecific pneumonia and cavitary pneumonia were the most common radiologic patterns. Sixteen patients had underlying lung graft-versus-host disease, including bronchiolitis obliterans (10 cases) with moderate obstructive lung defects. Whereas two of 10 patients who were treated for NTM died as a result of NTM progression, one of 15 patients who were not treated died of the same cause. This study shows that the incidence of respiratory NTM detection in SCT recipients was low and its virulence was not higher than expected. As patients frequently had concomitant infections and underlying lung diseases that made radiologic evaluation more difficult, we suggest that it would be advantageous to perform repeated microbiologic studies when NTM infection is clinically suspected."

In addition to established pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Staphylococcus aureus, novel Gram-negative non-fermenter bacteria and non-tuberculous mycobacteria have gained in clinical significance. Air sampling performed in inpatient and outpatient clinics, and analysis of cough aerosols expelled by CF patients provides evidence for potential airborne transmission of CF pathogens. Two outbreaks of 'Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense' have been reported among CF patients, raising the question of airborne transmission of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. In response to newer epidemiological evidence, international infection control guidance documents have changed. Guideline documents agree on the importance of specifications for ventilation when planning new CF inpatient facilities. New CF units should consider providing negative-pressure inpatient and outpatient rooms to diminish the risk of airborne contamination of ward corridors and communal areas. Air exchange rates of inpatient rooms and pulmonary function testing rooms need to be considered and optimized whenever possible. International guidelines disagree as to whether patients should be requested to wear masks in the hospital environment. "

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate change in quality of life in response to therapy, predictors of improvement in quality of life, and association of quality of life with traditional outcome measures. METHODS: Forty-seven patients were treated for Mycobacterium abscessus group lung infection (including one with Mycobacterium chelonae) and were followed prospectively for 2 years between December 2009 and May 2012. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was administered, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging was carried out, and culture data were collected at multiple time points. Predictors of improvement in the SGRQ total score greater than or equal to a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) at 12 months were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 85% female and 94% white, with a mean age of 65 years. Nine (20%) had a genetic diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (none F508del homozygous). Coinfection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurred in 28% and Pseudomonas in 26%. Chest CT imaging universally indicated bronchiectasis and nodules; 51% had lung cavities. Treatment included a mean of 17 months of antibiotics, and lung resection in 34%. Seventeen patients with M. avium complex (36%) and one with Mycobacterium kansasii were treated for coinfection. The mean SGRQ total score (SD) at baseline was 35 (20). At all follow-up time points, the mean SGRQ total score (SD) was significantly lower (better) than at baseline: 27 (17) at 3 months, P &lt; 0.01; 27 (19) at 6 months, P &lt; 0.01; 27 (20) at 12 months, P &lt; 0.01; and 30 (22) at 24 months, P = 0.02. At 12 and 24 months, respectively, 60% and 56% had improvement greater than or equal to the MCID in SGRQ total score. Improvement greater than or equal to the MCID at 12 months was positively associated with a history of respiratory exacerbation, isolate susceptible to imipenem-cilastatin, and lung resection surgery, and negatively associated with nodules &gt;4 mm in diameter on chest CT imaging, but these associations were not statistically significant in multivariable analysis. At 24 months, 16 patients (48%) with complete data were culture negative for 1 year and had discontinued M. abscessus group treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life was a sensitive indicator of treatment response and has the potential to be a useful parameter to guide treatment."

Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility. METHODS: Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria. RESULTS: Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

Previously, M. abscessus was thought to be independently acquired by susceptible individuals from the environment. However, using whole-genome analysis of a global collection of clinical isolates, we show that the majority of M. abscessus infections are acquired through transmission, potentially via fomites and aerosols, of recently emerged dominant circulating clones that have spread globally.

NTM lung disease often affects elderly people with chronic lung disease and may be a manifestation of a complex genetic disorder determined by interactions among multiple genes, as well as environmental exposures. To be diagnosed with NTM lung disease, patients should meet all clinical and microbiologic criteria, but the decision to start treatment is complex, requiring careful individualized analysis of risks and benefits.

Those for anaerobes and atypical mycobacteria were studied by a novel method using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In vivo BF colonization in lacrimal mucosae of chronic dacryocystitis, patients were studied from histopathological sections by Gram staining, H and E, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: Out of fifty different samples, sixty-three isolates were obtained in pure culture as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (25.39%), Escherichia coli (14.28%), Klebsiella pneumonia (14.28%), Mycobacterium abscessus (12.69%), Citrobacter spp. (9.52%), Bacteroides fragilis (6.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.7%), Proteus spp. (4.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.1%), Enterobacter spp. (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.5%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (1.5%). Among the isolates, 74% were found to be BF producers in the following frequency: P. aeruginosa 100%, S. epidermidis 100%, B. fragilis 100%, Klebsiella spp. 88.88%, S. aureus 81.25%, M. abscessus 75%, Citrobacter spp. 83.33%, Proteus spp. 66.66%, E. coli spp. 33.33%, and Enterobacter spp. 0%. CONCLUSION: AFM has been proven to be a useful method for detection of in vitro grown BF including those for anaerobes and atypical Mycobacteria. In vivo BF detection becomes possible by FISH. S. aureus was the most common isolate. Among the aerobic isolates, P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis were found to be the most common BF producers. Atypical mycobacteria were also found to be BF producers. Diagnosis of BF s in chronic infections significantly changes the management strategy as these infections can no longer be dealt simply with antibiotics alone but require mechanical removal of the foci along with antibiotic coverage for complete cure."

There are numerous causes of OP including acute respiratory infections such as viral and bacterial infections. However, Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) has rarely been reported as a causative pathogen of OP. Here, we report a 67-year-old woman with rapidly progressive pulmonary M. abscessus infection who developed OP and acute respiratory failure (ARF). She was treated successfully with a corticosteroid and anti-mycobacterial therapy. Our observations suggest that pulmonary M. abscessus infection should be added to the list of infectious conditions associated with OP."

The microorganisms causing these infections most frequently are Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus complex. Their incidence has increased in the last three decades. After identifying an NTM in the respiratory tract, clinical and radiological aspects must be considered to determine if isolations are clinically relevant. Predisposing conditions that could contribute to infection must also be investigated. Pulmonary disease due to NTM is presented in three clinical forms: a) pneumonitis due to hypersensitivity; b) fibrocavitary form; and c) nodular-bronchiectasic. The diagnosis of respiratory disease due to NTM does not make it obligatory to immediately initiate treatment. Before initiating the latter, other factors must be considered, such as age, comorbidities, life expectancy, due to the prolonged nature of treatments, with potential side effects and, in many cases, only a slight response to the treatment."

Clinical course after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has rarely been reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and report the clinical course and outcomes of GS patients after treatment with IVIg at Thailand's largest national tertiary referral hospital METHODS: This retrospective chart review included patients diagnosed with GS and treated with IVIg during the 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015 study period. RESULTS: Nine GS patients with a median age at diagnosis of 53 years were included. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common clinical manifestations. Six infectious organisms suggestive of cell-mediated immunity defect occurred in six patients, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium abscessus, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Aspergillus. Mean serum IgG level was 317 mg/dL. Eight patients had very low to undetectable B-cells. Five patients had either low CD4 number or impaired T-cell function, and one patient had both. All patients received IVIg replacement therapy monthly at a dose of 0.4 g/kg. The mean trough IgG level was 881 mg/dL. After treatment with IVIg replacement, seven patients had favorable clinical outcomes. However, two patients expired due to septicemia. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes of patients with GS are more dependent on the severity of infections and associated hematologic and autoimmune diseases than on the severity of thymoma itself. Therefore, early recognition and prompt IVIg replacement may change the natural course of this condition and may be successful in keeping the patient infections free."

Mycobacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but in most cystic fibrosis centers it is performed less frequently than culture for other pathogens. Consensus today recommends just one annual mycobacterial culture for asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, a strategy likely to lead to diagnostic delays. Postponement of diagnosis might be the deciding factor in whether an early colonization turns into chronic infection. This review highlights the latest developments in knowledge about the pathogenicity and clinical consequences of M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease, addressing the central theme of why pulmonary infection requires early identification and aggressive antibiotic treatment. The window of opportunity, before M. abscessus complex transforms from a mucosal colonizer to a chronic biofilm infection, is where microbial eradication is most likely to be successful, making early diagnosis essential for improved outcomes."

Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common involved pathogen, followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (MABSC), while Mycobacterium kansasii is not a major concern. The rate of infection rate in lung transplant recipients is reported to range from 1.5-22.4%. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here four cases of NTM pulmonary infection and disease among 63 patients who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at our hospital. Those four occurred following living-donor transplantation in two patients, one with pulmonary arterial hypertension and one with bronchiectasia, and deceased donor lung transplantation in two patients, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and interstitial pneumonia, respectively. NTM was not detected in any of the patients prior to transplantation. The involved pathogens were Mycobacterium gordonae in one, MAC in one, and MABSC in two of these patients, which were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in two and sputum in two. The one case of MAC and two of MABSC were symptomatic with consolidation shown in chest CT images indicating possible pneumonia, while the one with M. gordonae had no symptoms and was detected by surveillance BAL. Onset time from detection of NTM was greater than 3 years in the three with MABSC and M. gordonae and less than 3 years in the one with MAC. Each patient required a decrease in immunosuppressive agents according to their condition, while antibiotics therapy was performed in the three who were symptomatic. Sputum culture findings became negative after several months and were maintained thereafter in all. CONCLUSION: An NTM infection leading to pulmonary disease can occur at any time following lung transplantation. Treatment should be considered depending on the involved pathogens, individual status, and disease severity."

Current guideline therapeutic regimens involving an intensive phase of intravenous (IV) antibiotics followed by a consolidation phase of inhaled and oral antibiotics are not evidence-based. The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical outcomes and clearance of Mycobacterium abscessus complex (M. abscessus) from respiratory cultures in children with CF M. abscessus PD. METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis evaluated the first course of treatment for M. abscessus PD in 33 children in Queensland, Australia between 2001 and 2015. Spirometry and nutritional outcomes 2 years pretreatment and 1 year posttreatment were compared with clearance or relapse/persistence of Mycobacterium abscessus complex from respiratory cultures. RESULTS: Nine of 18 children who completed therapy, cleared infection. Three of 7 children who completed only intensive therapy cleared sputum compared with 0/8 children who did not. The trajectory of the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s and age standardized body mass index significantly improved posttreatment in those that cleared sputum (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that current treatment recommendations for M. abscessus PD are associated with some success in clearing infection in children with CF and improvement in lung function and body mass index.

Methods: We conducted a case-control study. Seventeen of 7013 patients with SARD fulfilling the criteria for pulmonary NTM infection were enrolled in the NTM group. The control group was matched for age, sex, and SARD at a ratio of 2:1. Results: Eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis, four with systemic vasculitis, three with Sjogren's syndrome, and one each with dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus were included in the NTM group. Mycobacterium avium was detected in 12 (71%) patients, M. chelonae in 2, and M. intracellulare, M. abscessus, and M. kansasii in 1 patient each. Preexisting lung disease was more common in the NTM group than in the control group (88% versus 38%, p = .0009), particularly bronchiectasis (65% versus 29%, p = .033). The body mass index and serum albumin level were significantly lower in the NTM group than in the control group. Six patients (35%) experienced NTM exacerbation during observation. Clinical immune status at the time of NTM diagnosis, as indicated by the peripheral blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and serum immunoglobulin G level, was unremarkable and comparable between patients with and without exacerbation, as were the treatments for SARD.

We examined determinants of outcomes in LTx recipients infected with M abscessus. METHODS: Electronic records of all patients who underwent LTx in a single transplant center between 2000 and 2015 were screened for isolation of M abscessus before or after LTx. RESULTS: Twenty-six cases of M abscessus isolation were identified. Twenty-four had M abscessus isolation post-LTx. Two had M abscessus isolated from a surgical site, while the others were pulmonary isolates. Out of these 22 with pulmonary isolates, 12 had clinical disease. In 73% of patients, treatment had to be temporarily held or switched due to intolerance and toxicity. There was a statistically significant worsening in survival in those who developed clinical disease compared to matched controls. Among the 12 patients with clinical pulmonary disease, use of clofazimine was significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Six patients had M abscessus isolation pretransplant.

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

This study investigated the characteristics of antimicrobial susceptibility of MABC isolates and the synergy between certain beta-lactam combinations against MABC infection. Methods: We collected 129 MABC isolates from patients with lower respiratory tract infections and categorized them into three subspecies. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 15 antimicrobials for the MABC isolates were determined using commercial Sensititre RAPMYCOI MIC plates and the broth microdilution method, as recommended in the CLSI (M24-A2). In addition, the MICs of imipenem, alone and with ceftazidime and/or avibactam, were assessed in vitro for all isolates. The erm(41) and rrl genes were also sequenced. Results: The MABC isolates exhibited >80% resistance to 11 of the 15 antimicrobials. Regarding the remaining four antimicrobials, the isolates were least resistant to tigecycline (12.4%) and amikacin (3.9%), and only partially resistant to two cefoxitin (39.5%) and imipenem (40.3%). Compared with M. massiliense isolates, M. abscessus and M. bolletii isolates were more resistant to amikacin and imipenem, whereas M. abscessus was significantly less resistant to tigecycline relative to M. massiliense and M. bolletii isolates. The clarithromycin inducible resistance rate was 68.4% and 74.3% among M. bolletii and M. abscessus isolates. Furthermore, 88.7% of the M. abscessus isolates carried a T at position 28 of erm(41), which is associated with inducible clarithromycin resistance. In addition, compared to imipenem with avibactam only, the MIC50 and MIC90values of imipenem after adding ceftazidime plus avibactam were decreased fourfold. Conclusion: The antimicrobial resistance rates and the characteristics of the erm(41) gene associated with inducible clarithromycin resistance were different among the three MABC subspecies.

We investigated 314 strains (1 isolate/patient/year) isolated from the lower respiratory tract of 51 chronically infected CF patients. Sequencing of rpoB gene was performed to identify the MABS subspecies. The erm(41) gene was sequenced to differentiate the strains with and without inducible macrolide resistance. Regions of 23S and 16S rRNA were sequenced to investigate mutations responsible for constitutive resistance to macrolides and aminoglycosides, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility, using commercial microdilution plates, was evaluated according to CLSI. M. abscessus subsp. abscessus accounted for 64% of the isolates, bolletii subspecies for 16% and massiliense subspecies for 20%. All the massiliense strains presented truncated erm(41) gene while 12 abscessus strains presented the mutation T28->C in the erm(41) gene, which makes it inactive. The 23S rRNA analysis did not show constitutive resistance to macrolides in any strain. Mutation of the 16S rRNA gene was highlighted in 2 strains out of 314, in agreement with high MIC values.

NTM are ubiquitous in the environment, with certain species causing opportunistic infection in humans, including Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus. The incidence and prevalence of NTM infections are rising globally, especially in developed countries with declining incidence rates of M. tuberculosis infection. Mycobacterium avium, a slow-growing mycobacterium, is associated with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections that can cause chronic pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, as well as lymphadenitis. M. abscessus infections are considered one of the most antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria and are associated with pulmonary disease, especially cystic fibrosis, as well as contaminated traumatic skin wounds, postsurgical soft tissue infections, and healthcare-associated infections (HAI). Clinical manifestations of diseases depend on the interaction of the host's immune response and the specific mycobacterial species. This review will give a general overview of the general characteristics, vulnerable populations most at risk, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium, in the context of MAC, and M. abscessus."

We retrospectively analyzed 75 consecutive patients with M. abscessus lung disease diagnosed at a tertiary hospital from January 2004 to April 2018. Among 52 patients with sufficient clinical data, 19 patients (42.2%) achieved treatment success. Compared with 26 (57.8%) patients in the treatment failure group, body mass index (BMI) (19.8 vs 17.5 kg/m2, P = 0.022), previous nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease (26.3% vs 61.5%, P = 0.034), the presence of cavitary lesions (31.6% vs 69.2%, P = 0.017), and the bronchiectasis score (3.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.003) were significantly different in the treatment success group. Multivariate analysis showed that age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90 to 0.99; P = 0.010), the presence of cavitary lesions (aHR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.94; P = 0.039), and previous NTM lung disease (aHR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.86; P = 0.026) were negatively associated with treatment success. This is the first study to show that previous NTM lung disease might be a clinically important factor related to unfavorable treatment outcomes in M. abscessus lung disease patients. To increase our understanding the characteristics of M. abscessus lung disease, this factor should be independently analyzed in future research."

Even in tuberculosis endemic country such as India, they are being isolated from the clinical specimens more often than previously. This change in trend is of concern, because they are often misdiagnosed as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or even as drug-resistant tuberculosis. Objectives: A prospective, observational study was planned to identify the frequency and risk factors associated with pulmonary and extrapulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections. Agreement between two commercially available molecular systems, namely GenoType Mycobacteria CM assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) used in the identification of mycobacterial species is also analysed. Materials and Methods: NTM isolated from pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical specimens over a period of 11/2 year was included in the study. Patient demographics were collected, and the risk factors associated with NTM infections were analyzed. NTM grown on culture was speciated using GenoType Mycobacteria CM assay (HAIN Life Sciences, Germany) and MALDI TOF MS (bioMerieux, France). Drug-susceptibility tests were done for rapid-growing NTM using E-test (bioMerieux, France). Results: Eight hundred and fifty-four mycobacteria were isolated from 5009 specimens processed during the study period. Out of the mycobacteria grown, 74 (8.7%) were NTM and 780 (91.3%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The NTM isolated from pulmonary specimens were 46 (62.16%) and from extrapulmonary sources were 28 (37.84%). The most common species isolated from pulmonary specimens was Mycobacterium intracellulare and from extrapulmonary specimens was Mycobacterium abscessus. Concordance between the two commercial assays used for the identification was 96.49%. The most common risk factor associated with pulmonary NTM was previous lung pathology, while with extrapulmonary NTM infection was previous surgical intervention. Drug-susceptibility tests for rapid growers showed amikacin and clarithromycin as the most active drugs in vitro. Conclusions: NTM plays a significant role in causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections even in our part of the country with high endemicity of tuberculosis. NTM has emerged as important pathogens even in the immunocompetent patients. There is a need for rapid diagnosis and susceptibility testing of NTM to aid physicians administer timely and appropriate treatment to the patients."

Hence, reliable antibiotic susceptibility data is required for effective treatment. Aims of this study were to investigate (i) the congruence of genotypic and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing, (ii) the relationship between resistance profile and clinical course, as well as (iii) the phylogenetic relations of Mab in a German patient cohort.Materials/methods: A total of 39 isolates from 29 patients infected or colonized with Mab underwent genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Clinical data were correlated to susceptibility data. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by means of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.Results: Macrolide resistance was mainly mediated by functional Erm (41) methyltransferases (T28 sequevars) in M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (n=25) and M. abscessus subsp. bolletii (n=2). It was significantly associated with impaired culture conversion (p=0.02). According to the core SNP phylogeny, we identified three clusters of closely related isolates with SNP distances below 25. Representatives of all circulating global clones (Absc. 1, Absc. 2 and Mass. 1) were identified in our cohort. However, we could not determine evidence for in-hospital interhuman transmission from clinical data.Conclusions: In our patient cohort, we identified three Mab clusters with closely related isolates and representatives of the previously described international clusters, but no human-to-human in-hospital transmission. Macrolide and aminoglycoside susceptibility data are critical for therapeutic decision-making in Mab infections."

Although it has been usually associated with chronic pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients, the second most frequent infection sites are the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Most of the cutaneous infections described in the literature occur secondary to cosmetic invasive procedures, many of them in the context of medical tourism. Its atypical presentation and antibiotic-resistant nature make its diagnosis and therapeutics challenging. In this case report, we present 2 cases of M. abscessus infections secondary to breast lipotransfer reported in the same private center. Case 1 patient underwent surgery to treat scar contracture resulting from previous quadrantectomy. Case 2 patient underwent breast augmentation with lipotransfer. Both of them developed lesions in the breast and in the donor site (abdomen). The therapeutic regimen used was amikacin (1 g/24 h) + tigecycline (50 mg/12 h). In case 1, we performed a simple mastectomy, and in case 2, periodical ultrasound-guided drainages were performed as additional procedures. To our knowledge, these are the first 2 cases that describe an infection secondary to breast lipotransfer. The aim of our report was to illustrate the presentation, diagnosis, therapeutic management, and strategies available to prevent this complication."

Recently, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that detects serum IgA antibody against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core antigen had been developed and found to be useful in discriminating MAC-PD from other lung diseases. The antibody was subsequently also found to be elevated in patients suffering Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary diseases (MAB-PD). This study is to evaluate this EIA kit in the serological diagnosis of MAC-PD in Hong Kong Chinese patients. Methods: The study was conducted in Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong between July 2017 and July 2018. Assay of the IgA antibody level using the EIA kit was done on blood samples collected from patients suffering from MAC-PD, MAB-PD, pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases. Results: There were 100 subjects recruited into the study, among which 11 were excluded. By using the cut-off value 0.7 U/mL provided by the manufacturer, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis were 73.7% and 77.6% for MAC-PD; 50% and 77.6% for MAB-PD. By receiver operating characteristic curves analysis, new cut-off for MAC-PD and MAB-PD were calculated as 1.771 U/mL and 0.172 U/m, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 68.4% and 86.2% for MAC-PD, whereas 66.7% and 72.4% for MAB-PD. Conclusions: Our study showed that the enzyme immunoassay of IgA antibodies against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid core antigen could help to distinguishing MAC and M. abscessus pulmonary diseases from pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases among Hong Kong Chinese patients. Further larger scale studies in our local population for the usefulness of this antibody test in the diagnosis and monitoring of MAC and M. abscessus lung diseases might be warranted."

However, a large-scale epidemiological study on this issue in Korea is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of NTM infection after lung transplant surgery in Korea. METHODS: Between October 2012 and December 2018, we retrospectively evaluated lung transplant recipients in a referral hospital in South Korea. A total of 215 recipients were enrolled. The median age at transplantation was 56 years (range, 17-75), and 62% were men. Bronchoscopy was performed according to the surveillance protocol and clinical indications. A diagnosis of NTM infection was defined as a positive NTM culture from a bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample, or two separate sputum samples. We determined NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America 2007 guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for conditional survival analysis in patients with follow-up of >=12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6.5%) were diagnosed with NTM infection at a median of 11.8 months (range, 0.3-51.4) after transplantation. Nine patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with NTM-PD, and the incidence rate was 1980/100,000 person-years. Mycobacterium abscessus was the most common species causing NTM-PD (66%), followed by M. avium complex (33%). The presence of NTM infection did not influence all-cause mortality among those who underwent follow-up for >=12 months (N = 133, log-rank P = 0.816). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM-PD was considerably high among lung-transplant recipients. M. abscessus was the most common causative species of NTM-PD after lung transplantation."

It has in vitro activity against nontuberculous mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex, but clinical data for this indication are lacking. Methods: Omadacycline use was reviewed at an 804-bed academic medical center. Patients were included if they received omadacycline for culture-proven M abscessus disease in 2019. Results: Four patients received omadacycline for the treatment of culture-positive M abscessus disease in 2019. Two patients had cutaneous disease, 1 had pulmonary disease, and 1 had osteomyelitis and bacteremia. The patients received omadacycline for a median duration of 166 days (range, 104-227) along with a combination of other antimicrobial agents. Omadacycline-containing regimens were associated with a clinical cure in 3 of 4 patients, with 1 patient improving on ongoing treatment. Omadacycline's tolerability was acceptable for patients with M abscessus disease, with 1 patient discontinuing therapy in month 6 due to nausea. Conclusions: Omadacycline is a novel oral option for the treatment of M abscessus disease, for which safe and effective options are needed. Although this case series is promising, further data are required to determine omadacycline's definitive role in the treatment of M abscessus disease."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium abscessusID:33107481TITLE:Epidemiology, diagnosis & treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases.ABSTRACT:Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitously present in the environment, but NTM diseases occur infrequently. NTM are generally considered to be less virulent than Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, these organisms can cause diseases in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. As compared to tuberculosis, person-to-person transmission does not occur except with M. abscessus NTM species among cystic fibrosis patients. Lung is the most commonly involved organ, and the NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) occurs frequently in patients with pre-existing lung disease. NTM may also present as localized disease involving extrapulmonary sites such as lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues and rarely bones. Disseminated NTM disease is rare and occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired immune defects such as HIV/AIDS. Rapid molecular tests are now available for confirmation of NTM diagnosis at species and subspecies level. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) is not routinely done except in non-responsive disease due to slowly growing mycobacteria ( M. avium complex, M. kansasii) or infection due to rapidly growing mycobacteria, especially M. abscessus. While the decision to treat the patients with NTM-PD is made carefully, the treatment is given for 12 months after sputum culture conversion. Additional measures include pulmonary rehabilitation and correction of malnutrition. Treatment response in NTM-PD is variable and depends on isolated NTM species and severity of the underlying PD. Surgery is reserved for patients with localized disease with good pulmonary functions. Future research should focus on the development and validation of non-culture-based rapid diagnostic tests for early diagnosis and discovery of newer drugs with greater efficacy and lesser toxicity than the available ones."

Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and February 2019, 18 cases of NTM were diagnosed and their relevant clinical, diagnostic, and treatment details were recorded after taking informed consent. Results: We report 18 cases of NTM involving lungs (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), joint (n = 2), genitourinary (n = 1), and central nervous system (n = 1). History of immunosuppression was present in two patients, whereas history of some form of intervention was seen in six patients.

In two patients, M. chelonae and M. abscessus were isolated in succession. Of these 18 patients, clinical response was present in 15 of the patients. Diagnosis and treatment of NTM in resource limited settings is extremely challenging. Conclusion: Most of the patients with NTM are misdiagnosed and are treated as tuberculosis in India, sometimes with a multidrug resistance regimen, which results in significant morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients who were newly diagnosed with pulmonary NTM disease at participating institutions between August 2009 and December 2018. Patients were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study. Taking into consideration the presence of competing risks, we used the cumulative incidence function with Gray's test and Fine-Gray regression analysis for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients (34 RA patients and 191 non-RA controls) were followed, with a mean time of 47.5 months. Death occurred in 35.3% of RA patients and 25.7% of non-RA patients. An exacerbation of pulmonary NTM disease represented the major cause of death. The estimated cumulative incidence of all-cause death at 5 years was 24% for RA patients and 23% for non-RA patients. For NTM-related death, the 5-year cumulative incidence rate was estimated to be 11% for RA patients and 18% for non-RA patients. Gray's test revealed that long-term mortality estimates were not significantly different between patient groups. Fine-Gray regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for NTM-related death were advanced age (adjusted hazards ratio 7.28 [95% confidence interval 2.91-18.20] for >=80 years and 3.68 [1.46-9.26] for 70-80 years vs. <70 years), male sex (2.40 [1.29-4.45]), Mycobacterium abscessus complex (4.30 [1.46-12.69] vs. M. avium), and cavitary disease (4.08 [1.70-9.80]). CONCLUSIONS: RA patients with pulmonary NTM disease were not at greater risk of long-term mortality compared with non-RA patients. Rather, advanced age, male sex, causative NTM species, and cavitary NTM disease should be considered when predicting the outcomes of RA patients with pulmonary NTM disease."

Macrolides such as clarithromycin are the recommended first line drugs for treatment of M. abscessus infections. However, M. abscessus has dual mechanisms of resistance to macrolides, making treatment by macrolides difficult. A functional erm(41) gene confers for inducible resistance while acquired mutations on the 23S rRNA rrl gene confer for constitutive resistance. METHODS: We have developed a real-time PCR assay to detect both inducible and acquired resistance to clarithromycin, and compared the results to traditional erm(41) and rrl sequencing and phenotypic susceptibility testing using Sensititre  plates. RESULTS: Of the total 126 M. abscessus isolates tested, truncated erm(41) was found in 23/126 (18.3%) of the samples, 27/126 (21.4%) had a T28C mutation in erm(41), and 2/126 (1.6%) had an acquired A2058C mutation in rrl. The phenotypic results correlated with the expected sequencing results in 121/126 samples (96%). Phenotypic testing compared to real-time PCR resolved 2 of these discrepancies by showing the existence of both erm(41) alleles in the isolates that sequencing missed. One culture was found to be mixed with two M. abscessus subsp. as per hsp65 sequencing and 2 isolates had discordance between molecular and phenotypic results. It was presumed that 3 isolates showed discrepancy between sequencing and real-time PCR, but one culture was mixed and other 2 detected both alleles by real-time PCR leading to 100% concordance when compared to sequencing. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, real-time PCR is more accurate for detection of both acquired and induced clarithromycin resistance, specifically when mixed genic profiles are present in a sample."

It is well known that Mycobacterium bovis and other species in the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) can cause respiratory diseases as zoonosis. We analyzed the MTC isolates collected from tuberculosis patients from Japan in 2002 using a multiplex PCR system that detected cfp32, RD9 and RD12. A total of 970 MTC isolates that were representative of the tuberculosis cases throughout Japan, were examined using this method. As a result, 966 (99.6%) M. tuberculosis, two Mycobacterium africanum and two Mycobacterium canettii were identified using a multiplex PCR system, while no M. bovis was detected. Two isolates that lacked RD9 were initially considered to be M. canettii, but further analysis of the hsp65 sequence revealed them to be M. tuberculosis. Also two M. africanum were identified as M. tuberculosis using the -215 narG nucleotide polymorphism. Though PCR-linked methods have been used for a rapid differentiation of MTC and NTM, from our cases we suggest careful interpretation of RD based identification. "

OBJECTIVES: To identify species among Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) strains responsible for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and determine their susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drugs. DESIGN: Sputum specimens were collected from 509 consecutively admitted adults and cultured. Identification of cultured strains was mainly based on culture growth characteristics and standard biochemical tests with spoligotyping for confirmation on a subset of strains. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using the indirect proportion method. RESULTS: Growth of MTC strains occurred in specimens of 445/509 (87.4%) patients: 433 (97.3%) were identified as M. tuberculosis, 10 (2.3%) as M. africanum and 2 (0.4%) as M. bovis. The overall resistance rate was 7.9%, with 7.3% resistance in new cases and 21.1% in previously treated cases. Isoniazid resistance in new cases was most common (4.2%), followed by streptomycin (3.3%), rifampicin (1.9%) and ethambutol (0.9%). Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was more frequent in previously treated than in new cases (10.5% vs. 1.4%, P &lt; 0.05).

The multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) rate was 4/91 (4%) and 4/13 (31%) in new and retreatment TB cases, respectively. Treatment success was achieved in 53% of patients. In TB/HIV coinfected patients, mortality rate was 25%. In this setting, TB epidemiology is characterized by a high rate of TB/HIV coinfection and low treatment success rates. MDR-TB is a major public health concern; the need to step-up in-country diagnostic capacity for culture and drug susceptibility testing as well as access to second-line TB drugs urgently requires action.

Mycobacterium africanum West Africa 2 (Maf 2) remains an important cause of TB in West Africa and causes one third of disease in The Gambia. Since the introduction of MPT64 antigen tests, a higher than expected rate of suspected non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) was seen among AFB smear positive TB suspects, which led us to prospectively assess sensitivity of the MPT64 antigen test in our setting. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the abundance of mRNA encoded by the mpt64 gene in sputa of patients with untreated pulmonary TB caused by Maf 2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Subsequently, prospectively collected sputum samples from presumptive TB patients were inoculated in the BACTEC MGIT 960 System. One hundred and seventy-three acid fast bacilli (AFB)-positive and blood agar negative MGIT cultures were included in the study. Cultures were tested on the day of MGIT positivity with the BD MGIT TBc Identification Test. A random set of positives and all negatives were additionally tested with the SD Bioline Ag MPT64 Rapid. MPT64 negative cultures were further incubated at 37 C and retested until positive. Bacteria were spoligotyped and assigned to different lineages. Maf 2 isolates were 2.52-fold less likely to produce a positive test result and sensitivity ranged from 78.4% to 84.3% at the beginning and end of the recommended 10 day testing window, respectively. There was no significant difference between the tests. We further showed that the decreased rapid test sensitivity was attributable to variations in mycobacterial growth behavior and the smear grades of the patient. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In areas where Maf 2 is endemic MPT64 tests should be cautiously used and MPT64 negative results confirmed by a second technique, such as nucleic acid amplification tests, to avoid their misclassification as NTMs."

The reasons for this geographic restriction of M. africanum remain unclear. Here, we performed a prospective study to explore associations between the characteristics of TB patients and the MTBC lineages circulating in Ghana. METHOD: We genotyped 1,211 MTBC isolates recovered from pulmonary TB patients recruited between 2012 and 2014 using single nucleotide polymorphism typing and spoligotyping. Associations between patient and pathogen variables were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 1,211 MTBC isolates analysed, 71.9 % (871) belonged to Lineage 4; 12.6 % (152) to Lineage 5 (also known as M. africanum West-Africa 1), 9.2 % (112) to Lineage 6 (also known as M. africanum West-Africa 2) and 0.6 % (7) to Mycobacterium bovis. Univariate analysis revealed that Lineage 6 strains were less likely to be isoniazid resistant compared to other strains (odds ratio = 0.25, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.77, P &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that Lineage 5 was significantly more common in patients from the Ewe ethnic group (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR): 2.79; 95 % CI: 1.47-5.29, P &lt; 0.001) and Lineage 6 more likely to be found among HIV-co-infected TB patients (adjOR = 2.2; 95 % confidence interval (CI: 1.32-3.7, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the importance of M. africanum in Ghana and highlight the need to differentiate between Lineage 5 and Lineage 6, as these lineages differ in associated patient variables."

M. africanum was first described and isolated in 1968 from the sputum of a Senegalese patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and it has been identified increasingly as an important cause of human TB, particularly prevalent in West Africa. The restricted geographical distribution of M. africanum, in contrast to the widespread global distribution of other species of MTBC, requires explanation. Available data indicate that M. africanum may also have important differences in transmission, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions, which could affect the evaluation of new TB intervention tools (diagnostics and vaccines)-those currently in use and those under development. The unequal geographical distribution and spread of MTBC species means that individual research findings from one country or region cannot be generalized across the continent. Thus, generalizing data from previous and ongoing research studies on MTBC may be inaccurate and inappropriate. A major rethink is required regarding the design and structure of future clinical trials of new interventions. The West, Central, East, and Southern African EDCTP Networks of Excellence provide opportunities to take forward these pan-Africa studies. More investments into molecular, epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, and immunological studies across the African continent are required to enable further understanding of host-M. africanum interactions, leading to the development of more specific diagnostics, biomarkers, host-directed therapies, and vaccines for TB."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium africanumID:28043641TITLE:Association of slow recovery of Mycobacterium africanum-infected patients posttreatment with high content of Persister-Like bacilli in pretreatment sputum.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium africanum that causes 40% of tuberculosis (TB) in West Africa grows more slowly in culture and has similar transmission capacity compared with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but M. africanum-exposed contacts progress more slowly to active disease. The presence of lipid body (LB) containing M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) cells in sputum samples has been associated with mycobacterial transcriptomes indicating slow or no growth and persister-like antibiotic tolerance. Slow-growing bacilli have been found to display a persister-like phenotype with the accumulation of LBs and drug tolerance. Our previous study showed that the body mass index and lung damage resolution on chest X-ray were significantly improved slower in M. africanum-infected patients posttreatment than in M. tuberculosis-infected patients; however, the reason for this remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that these differences could be either due to significant differences in drug resistance between the MTBC lineages or a difference in their content of persisters, as indicated by the percentage of LP-positive bacilli in sputum. METHODS: Sputum isolates collected before treatment from patients with TB were subjected to drug susceptibility testing using the BD BACTEC MGIT 960 SIRE kit. The percentage of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and LB-positive bacilli in pretreatment sputum was determined by a dual staining procedure using Auramine O and LipidTOX Red neutral lipid stain, respectively, and fluorescence microscopy imaging. RESULTS: Out of the 77 isolates tested, 9 showed resistance to at least one drug and only 2 showed multidrug (rifampicin and isoniazid) resistance among M. tuberculosis-infected patients. The percentage of AFB-positive smears was similar between the two groups (p=0.821), whereas that of LP-positive bacilli was significantly higher (p=0.0059) in M. africanum-infected patients' sputa (n=24) than in M. tuberculosis-infected patients' sputa (n=36). In addition, the bacillary lengths were significantly higher in M. africanum-infected patients' sputa than in M. tuberculosis-infected patients' sputa (p=0.0007). A high frequency of LP-positive bacilli in pretreatment sputum was associated with a poor body mass index and lung damage on chest X-ray improvement following anti-TB treatment in both the groups (r2=0.022; p=0.017). CONCLUSION: The slow clinical recovery of M. africanum-infected patients compared with M. tuberculosis-infected patients posttreatment may be at least partially associated with the persistence of drug-tolerant ""fat and lazy"" bacilli."

The objective of the present study was to identify the species and strains of M. tuberculosis complex causing pulmonary tuberculosis in central Ethiopia. METHODS: A health institution- based cross-sectional study was conducted on 338 smear positive TB cases visiting three hospitals between October 2012 and September 2013. Morning and spot sputum samples were collected before the starting of treatment regimens. Thus, a total of 338 pooled sputum samples collected from these cases. Samples were cultured on Lowenstein Jensen media and the isolates were identified by the region of difference (RD) 9 based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping. RESULT: Of the total isolates 98.6% of the isolates were identified to be M. tuberculosis while the remaining 1.4% were identified as M. africanum. Further, typing of M. tuberculosis using spoligotyping lead to the identification of 90 different strains of M. tuberculosis. Of these strains, 32 were clustered consisting of more than one isolate while the remaining 58 strains were unique consisting of single isolate. Thus, 79.3% (223/281) of the isolates were found in the clustered while only 20.6% (58/281) of the strains were unique. Forty-five of the spolgotyping patterns were registeredin the SITVIT2 or SpolDB4 database in while the remaining 45 were notfound in the database and hence were orphan strains. The dominant strains were SIT53, SIT149, and SIT54, consisting of 43, 37 and 34 isolates, respectively. Classification of the spoligotype patterns using TB-insight RUN TB-Lineage showed that 86.8, 6.4, 5, 1.4% ofthe isolatesbelonged to the Euro-American lineage, East-African-Indian, Indo-oceanic and M. africanum, respectively. CONCLUSION: The identification of clustered and new strains using spolygotyping in present study does not give conclusive finding as spoligotyping has low discriminatory power. Thus, further identification of these isolates using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VENTR) and or whole genome sequencing (WGS) recommended."

In the Spanish pediatric population, the incidence is 5 cases/100 000 children between 5 and 14 years and 13 cases/100 000 children between 0 and 4 years. The infection is transmitted through the respiratory tract by baciliferous patients. Children eliminate few bacilli in respiratory secretions and do not usually transmit the infection. In Spain, the resistance to isoniazid in the general population is 5%, being higher in the immigrant population, which is important to take into account for the treatment of cases.

A population-based molecular epidemiological study was conducted to determine TB transmission in Ghana. METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates obtained from prospectively sampled pulmonary TB patients between July 2012 and December 2015 were characterized using spoligotyping and standard 15-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing for transmission studies. RESULTS: Out of 2309 MTBC isolates, 1082 (46.9%) unique cases were identified, with 1227 (53.1%) isolates belonging to one of 276 clusters. The recent TB transmission rate was estimated to be 41.2%. Whereas TB strains of lineage 4 belonging to M. tuberculosis showed a high recent transmission rate (44.9%), reduced recent transmission rates were found for lineages of Mycobacterium africanum (lineage 5, 31.8%; lineage 6, 24.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate high recent TB transmission, suggesting the occurrence of unsuspected outbreaks in Ghana. The observed reduced transmission rate of M. africanum suggests other factor(s) (host/environmental) may be responsible for its continuous presence in West Africa."

METHODS: A total of 177 M. tuberculosis complex isolates from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases in southwest Ethiopia were genotyped by spoligotyping. Of the strains included in this study, 126 were pan-susceptible strains while the remaining 51 isolates were resistant to one or more first-line anti-TB drugs. The genotyping results were compared to the international spoligotyping (SITVIT) database of the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe and the newly revised publicly available international multi-marker database (SITVITWEB/SPOLDB4). An online tool Run TB-Lineage was also used to predict the major lineages using a conformal Bayesian network analysis. RESULTS: The spoligotyping of the 177 isolates resulted in 69 different spoligotype patterns of which 127 (71.8%) were clustered into 19 spoligoclusters (with clustering rate of 61.02%). Each cluster contains 2-29 isolates. Of the isolates with corresponding SIT in SITVIT/SDB4, the predominant strains identified were SIT 37 of the T3 subfamily with 29 isolates followed by SIT 53 of the T1 subfamily with 20 isolates. SIT 777 of the H4 subfamily and SIT 25 of the CAS1_DELHI subfamily each consisting of six isolates were identified. Eighty spoligotype patterns were orphan as they were not recorded in the SITVIT2/SPDB4 database. Further classification of the isolates on the basis of major lineages showed that 82.5% and 14.1% of the isolates belonged to Euro-American and East African Indian lineages, respectively, while 2.8% of the isolates belonged to Mycobacterium africanum and 0.6% to Indo-Oceanic. CONCLUSION: The ill-defined T and H clades were predominant around Jimma. The substantial number of orphans recorded in the study area warrants for additional studies with genotyping methods with better resolution and covering whole areas of southwest Ethiopia."

Mycobacterium africanum, a member of MTBC is responsible for a large percentage of TB cases in West Africa, however, it is rarely identified outside of this part of the World. Whether or not differential HLA polymorphism (an important host factor) is contributing to the geographic restriction of M. africanum to West Africa is unknown. Here, we conducted a cohort study in Mali of newly diagnosed individuals with active pulmonary TB and normal healthy controls. The MTBC isolates were spoligotyped to determine the TB study groups (M. tuberculosis sensu stricto LAM10 and M. africanum), and HLA typing was performed on peripheral blood. Unlike previous reports on other populations, we found that HLA class-I alleles were significantly associated with active TB disease in this population. HLA-B alleles (B*07:02, B*08:01, B*14:02, B*15:03, B*15:10, B*18:01, B*42:01, B*42:02, B*51:01 and B*81:01) were significantly associated with M. africanum (40%-45%) and M. tuberculosis (75%) compared with healthy controls. Many HLA-A alleles (A*02:05, A*34:02, A*66:01 and A*68:02) were also associated with both TB groups (65%-70%). However, many class II HLA-DR variants were found to be associated with M. tuberculosis but not M. africanum with the exception of the DRB1*03:01, which was associated with both groups. The differential HLA distribution observed in this study might be at least partially responsible for the geographical restriction of M. africanum infections to West Africa."

To test the hypothesis that they respond faster to TB treatment, we determined the rate of smear conversion of new pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Bamako, Mali by the main MTBc lineages. METHODS: Between 2015 and 2017, we conducted a prospective cohort study of new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Bamako. Confirmed MTBc isolates underwent genotyping by spoligotyping for lineage classification. Patients were followed at 1 month (M), 2M and 5M to measure smear conversion in auramine (AR) and Fluorescein DiAcetate (FDA) vital stain microscopy. RESULT: All the first six human MTBc lineages were represented in the population, plus M. bovis in 0.8% of the patients. The most widely represented lineage was the modern Euro-American lineage (L) 4, 57%, predominantly the T family, followed by L6 (M. africanum type 2) in 22.9%. Ancestral lineages 1, 5, 6 and M. bovis combined amounted to 28.8%. Excluding 25 patients with rifampicin resistance, smear conversion, both by AR and FDA, occurred later in L6 compared to L4 (HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.66-0.97) for AR, and HR 0.81 (95%CI 0.68-0.97) for FDA). In addition we found that HIV negative status, higher BMI at day 0, and patients with smear grade at baseline &lt;= 1+ were associated with earlier smear conversion. CONCLUSION: The six major human lineages of the MTBc all circulate in Bamako. Counter to our hypothesis, we found that patients diseased with modern M. tuberculosis complex L4 respond faster to TB treatment than those with M. africanum L6."

The aim of this study was to compare MAF with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) with regard to time from symptom onset to TB diagnosis, and clinical and radiological characteristics. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Bamako, Mali, between August 2014 and July 2016. Seventy-seven newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients who were naive to treatment were enrolled at Mali's University Clinical Research Center. Sputum cultures were performed to confirm the diagnosis and spoligotyping to identify the mycobacterial strain. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with disease progression. Overall, the frequency of female patients was 25% in MAF infection and only 10.0% in MTB infection (OR = 2.9), and MAF was more represented in patients aged >= 30 years (57.1% versus 36.7% [OR = 2.3]). More MAF- than MTB-infected patients had a history of a prior TB contact (32.1% versus 14.3% [OR = 2.8]). The mean duration between cough onset and TB diagnosis was 111 days (~3.7 months) for MAF and 72 days (~2.4 months) for MTB (P = 0.007). In a multivariate regression, weight loss (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m2) and cough duration (> 4 months) were strongly associated with MAF infection (OR = 5.20 [1.49-18.26], P = 0.010, and 4.74 [1.2-18.58], P = 0.02), respectively. Our data show that MAF infection was significantly associated with lower BMI and a longer time between symptom onset and TB diagnosis than MTB. This supports the concept that MAF infection may have slower disease progression and less severe cough symptoms than MTB."

While MTB is isolated worldwide, MAF is almost completely restricted to the African continent, and despite the historical proximity between Brazil and Africa during the slave trade, no case of TB being caused by MAF has been reported in Brazil to date. We hereby describe the first case of TB caused by MAF in Brazil comparing its genome against the published ones.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the cultured isolate was identified as belonging to MTBC and partial sequence of the hsp65 gene was identical to that of MAF. This was confirmed by genotyping based on detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Region of Difference (RD) and spoligotyping. The isolate presented the Shared International Typing (SIT) 181. In the whole-genome comparison against MAF genomes available on published EMBL-EBI European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), the Brazilian genome (MAFBRA00707) was identified as belonging to Lineage 6 and clustered with isolates from The Gambia.

Pulmonary cases were 59.3% with a surprising clinical relevance of 75% based on American Thoracic Society guidelines. Among the 40.7% extra-pulmonary cases, 50% of them were skin infections. The identification revealed 16 species and all of them are reporting for the first time in Saudi Arabia. The major species obtained were Mycobacterium monascence (18.5%), M. cosmeticum (11.1%), M. kubicae (11.1%), M. duvalli (7.4%), M.terrae (7.4%) and M. triplex (7.4%). This is the first report on clinical relevance of M. kubicae, M. tusciae, M.yongonense, M. arupense and M.iranicum causing pulmonary disease and M. monascence, M. duvalli, M. perigrinum, M. insubricum, M. holsaticum and M. kyorinense causing various extra-pulmonary diseases in Saudi Arabia. Ascites caused by M. monascence and cecum infection by M. holsaticum were the rarest incidents. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To the first time in the country, clinical significance of various rare NTM's are well explored and the finding warrants a new threat to the Saudi Arabian clinical settings."

In Zambia, Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria are gaining recognition as pathogens of public health significance. However, there is scanty information on the isolation and speciation of these organisms for better patient management, consequently reducing the burden of these infections. Given the above information, the thrust of this study was to isolate and characterize NTM from humans and water in Namwala district of Zambia. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study were 153 individuals with suspected TB were sampled from four health facilities in Namwala district, sputum samples were also collected. Additionally, 149 water samples were collected from different water drinking sources such as Tap water, Borehole water, rivers, wells and streams. Standard TB culture methods were employed to isolate Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria and later 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region Sequencing was employed to characterize NTM. RESULTS: Seven (7, 4.6%) NTM species were identified from humans with M. arupense (3, 42.9%) being the most common organism, while twenty three (23, 15.4%) NTM were identified from water with the common species being Mycobacterium gordonae (5, 21.7%). Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum were both identified from human and water samples. CONCLUSION: This study has shown the isolation of NTM species from humans and water. The isolation of NTM from drinking water sources could signify a public health risk to humans."

However, unlike the diagnostic value of its isolation from osteoarticular specimens, the significance of detecting M. arupense in respiratory specimens is not yet clear. CASE PRESENTATION: To our knowledge, we, for the first time, described the identification of M. arupense from the pleural effusion of an immunocompetent patient, who presented with fever and chylothorax. The symptoms resolved with doxycycline treatment for 45 days and a low-fat, high-protein diet. Follow-up at 14 months showed no relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Because the patient fully recovered without combined anti-NTM treatment, we did not consider M. arupense the etiological cause in this case. This indicates that M. arupense detected in pleural effusion is not necessarily a causative agent and careful interpretation is needed in terms of its clinical relevance."

Numerous cases of osteo-articular infections of this bacterium are reported nowadays, while the pulmonary infection is rare. We identified Mycobacterium arupense in non-healing wound infection of an elderly woman with history of diabetes mellitus. She has negative tests for HIV, HBV and HCV, but was positive for HTLV-1. The patient was referred according to mild-fever, non-healing, destructive, and swelled lesion on her left foot. The mycobacterial wounds infection was suspected due to her non-conclusive previous treatment. The pathology, acid-fast staining, conventional and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed the micro-organism to be M. arupense . Finally, the patient recovered following two-week consumption of clarithromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin. The results of this study provide evidence on the potential pathogenicity, clinical outcomes and treatment of infections caused by this bacterium."

METHODS: A database search of primary care information for the dates and causes of death for all patients documented with HIV infection and living in Southern Alberta between 1984 and 2003 was undertaken. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Causes of death were then individually confirmed by reviewing the patients' hospital charts, autopsy reports, or death certificates and coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revisions. AIDS deaths were reconciled with Public Health Reports. The time span was divided into pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (1984-1996) and current HAART (1997-2003) periods. RESULTS: Between 1984 and 2003, there were 560 deaths in the 1987 individuals living with HIV infection in Southern Alberta. Of these, 436 deaths (78%) occurred pre-HAART and 124 (22%) in the current HAART period. The crude mortality rate declined from 117 deaths per 1000 patient-years pre-HAART to 24 in the current HAART period. In the pre-HAART era, 90% of all deaths were AIDS related whereas only 67% were AIDS related in the current HAART era. The leading causes of AIDS deaths were AIDS multiple causes (31%), Mycobacterium avium complex (18%), Pneumocystis pneumonia (10%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7%). The proportion of non-AIDS related deaths increased from 7% pre-HAART to 32% in the current HAART era. Accidental deaths, including drug overdose (29%), suicide (7%) and violence (3%), hepatic disease (19%), non-AIDS related malignancies (19%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) accounted for the majority of non-AIDS related deaths. No deaths directly caused by drug toxicity were found. Overall, 21% of patients who died were antiretroviral (ARV)-naive. A total of 14% of patients dying from AIDS were ARV-naive in contrast to 35% dying from non-HIV related conditions. Of all those dying from AIDS, 23% died&lt;3 months after their initial diagnosis, reflecting late presentation. In the current HAART era, 87% of patients who died from AIDS were extensively treated, reflecting HAART treatment failures due mostly to multiclass drug resistance (42%), inexorable disease progression despite ARV (32%), lack of ability or interest to be maintained on a lifelong HAART programme (21%) and, rarely, drug intolerance (&lt;1%). CONCLUSIONS: Deaths from AIDS-related causes have decreased significantly, but deaths from non-AIDS related conditions have increased, both as an absolute number of deaths and as a proportion of all deaths in HIV-infected patients. The increasing age of the HIV population, and the increased mean CD4 count, increased proportion of intravenous drug users, increased hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus coinfection rate, and increased history of smoking seen in our population also influenced the mortality rate and causes of death. These factors must also be considered in projecting future trends in mortality of an HIV-infected population."

However, there are only a few reports of pediatric NTM infections in Spain (13 articles since 1990). This article presents an update of the epidemiology, diagnostic methods, and treatment of these infections in children. The most frequent clinical syndromes caused by NTM include lymphadenitis, pulmonary and disseminated infections in immunocompromised children. NTM cervical adenitis usually causes chronic infection associated with sinus tract formation and scarring. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the involved node. Incision and drainage of the enlarged node should be avoided because it can lead to chronic drainage or sinus tract formation. Medical treatment with azithromycin or clarithromycin associated with rifabutin, ethambutol or ciprofloxacin should be reserved for cases in which the family refuses surgery, a recurrence occurs or complete excision is impossible. Pulmonary disease caused by NTM is relatively rare in immunocompetent children, but is increasingly reported in children with cystic fibrosis. In these patients, the clinical significance of the presence of NTM in the sputum is unclear. The persistence of positive cultures, especially if bacilloscopy is positive and the patient shows clinical evidence of pulmonary disease exacerbation, is an indication to start treatment. Disseminated infection caused by NTM can appear in patients with severe immunodepression, especially in HIV-infected children with CD4 cell counts of less than 100 cells/mm3. Early antibiotic therapy with at least three drugs including a macrolide, and immune recovery with aggressive antiretroviral therapy are the keys to improving quality of life and survival in these patients."

She had an elevated perinuclear ANCA and antimyeloperoxidase antibody. She had a positive PPD test and a cavitary lesion in the right upper lung lobe; biopsy of the lung lesion showed granulomatous vasculitis, but the culture grew Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI). There are clinical and histiologic similarities between ANCA vasculitis and pulmonary MAI infection. Treatment of vasculitis with immunosuppressive agents could be detrimental in patients with MAI infection. Thus, when ANCA associated vasculitis is considered, mycobacterium infection should be excluded before starting immunosuppressive therapy."

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether demographic disparities in use of OI prophylaxis persist in 2001 and if outpatient care is associated with OI prophylaxis utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN: Demographic, clinical, and pharmacy utilization data were collected from 10 U.S. HIV primary care sites in the HIV Research Network. SUBJECTS: This study consisted of adult patients (&gt;or=18 years old) in longitudinal HIV primary care. MEASURES: Indications for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis were 2 or more CD4 counts less than 200 or 50 cells/mm(3) during calendar year (CY) 2001, respectively. Using multivariate logistic regression, we examined demographic and clinical characteristics associated with receipt of PCP or MAC prophylaxis and the association of outpatient utilization with appropriate OI prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 88.1% received PCP prophylaxis and 87.6% received MAC prophylaxis. Approximately 80% had 4 or more outpatient visits during CY 2001. Adjusting for care site, male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.47), Medicare coverage (OR, 1.60), and having 4 or more outpatient visits in a year (OR, 2.34) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of PCP prophylaxis. Adjusting for care site, having 4 or more outpatient visits in a year (OR, 1.85) was associated with increased likelihood of receipt of MAC prophylaxis. There were no demographic or insurance characteristics associated with receipt of MAC prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of OI prophylaxis has increased since the mid-1990s, and previous racial and HIV risk factor disparities in receipt of OI prophylaxis have waned. Integration into the healthcare system is an important correlate of receiving OI prophylaxis."

METHODS: Hospital discharge diagnoses were established for 521 HIV-positive patients. RESULTS: Respiratory disease accounted for 49% of the admissions. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) was the main cause of respiratory disease (52%) followed by Pneumocystis carinii (PCP, 24%), non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM, 11%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, 9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease was established using bacteriological, clinical and radiographic criteria. NTM disease was defined following the American Thoracic Society criteria. NTM was disseminated in the majority of cases (19 Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), one Mycobacterium kansasii). Nine patients had respiratory disease (seven MAC, one Mycobacterium fortuitum, one Mycobacterium kansasii) and one had gastrointestinal disease caused by MAC. Mortality was 10% for NTM disseminated cases; none of the TB patients died over the course of the study. The length of hospitalization for NTM patients was longer (15+/-13 days) than for other respiratory cases (10+/-10, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: NTM disease along with its related mortality is a significant pathology as a cause of hospitalization among HIV-infected individuals."

To make a differential diagnosis between bacterial pneumonia, pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens, and mycobacterial infections, it is very important to analyze the radiological findings of inflammatory lung diseases based on normal antomical structures. If clinicoradiological anlyses could make these differentiations, the appropriate treatment strategy for respiratory infections could be established. To accomplish this, exact orientations of pulmonary lobulus, acinus, and respiratory bronchioles is very important. Then, through analyzing chest CT findings and distribution patterns based on normal anatomical structures, estimation of causative pathogens could be possible. Especially, whether inflammatory exudates could pass Kohn's pores as well as Lambert's channel or not is very important factor to affect radiological findings of several pneumonia (as traditionally called ""segmental"" and ""nonsegmental"" distribution). To differentiate infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis from nontuberculous mycobacteria, several important criteria have been demonstrated. Briefly, it has been suggested that Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) respiratory infection is increasing especially in elderly women without underlying diseases. In MAC respiratory infection, right middle lobe and left lingula are frequently involved and centrilobular nodules and diffuse bronchiectases are characteristic radiological findings. Finally, the role of telithromycin in the treatment of respiratory infections is discussed."

OBJECTIVES: Characterize patients, treatment, and isolates in macrolide-resistant MAC lung disease. METHODS: Retrospective chart review, susceptibility testing, molecular fingerprinting, and DNA sequence analyses of resistant MAC isolates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 51 patients over a 15-yr period with clarithromycin-resistant MAC (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)&gt;or=32 microg/ml) lung disease at a single referral center. Twenty-four (47%) patients had nodular disease with bronchiectasis and 27 (53%) had upper lobe cavitary disease. Most patients (77%) had M. intracellulare. Sequencing of the 23S r-RNA gene showed 49 of 51 isolates (96%) with the expected mutation in adenine 2058 or 2059. Risk factors for resistance included macrolide monotherapy or combination with a quinolone only (39/51 or 76%). Macrolide resistance developed in 12 of 303 (4.0%) patients started on the American Thoracic Society-recommended two companion drugs, with no risk difference in clarithromycin versus azithromycin and daily versus intermittent therapy. Sputum conversion with macrolide-resistant MAC occurred in 11 of 14 (79%) patients who received more than 6 mo of injectable aminoglycoside therapy and lung resection, compared with 2 of 37 (5%) who did not. The 1-yr mortality in patients who remained culture positive was 34% (13/38) compared with 0% (0/13) of patients who became culture negative (converted). CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide resistance rarely occurs in patients also receiving ethambutol and a rifamycin. Macrolide-resistant MAC lung disease requires aggressive drug and surgical therapy for cure."

The authors' experience].ABSTRACT:UNLABELLED: The diagnosis of NTM-related pulmonary disease is based on clinical symptoms, radiological features and several positive cultures of one and the same NTM species from samples obtained from the respiratory tract. Short hospitalization usually does not enable sufficient diagnostic procedures to meet the diagnostic criteria, and this may lead to the reduction of diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of the study was to draw attention to NTM-related pulmonary disease, to share the authors' experience in the diagnosing of pulmonary mycobacteriosis and to indicate the possibilities of improving the diagnostic accuracy in this disease. A group of 31 patients with sputum, bronchial washing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) NTM-positive cultures was selected from a cohort of 245 patients evaluated for tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases (total number of 1277 specimens were invastigated). In two of them NTM related pulmonary disease was diagnosed (caused by M. kansasii and M. avium) at the course of initial evaluation. In the remaining 29 patients the microbiological data did not allow to establish the diagnosis of mycobacterial lung disease mainly due to a small number of samples from the respiratory tract. From this group 13 patients were reevaluated within 3 - 6 months from the initial investigation. This allowed to identify two new cases of mycobacteriosis (M. kansasii and M. avium). Thus among 31 patients with NTM positive cultures from respiratory tract specimens 4 patients (4/31, 12,9%) met the diagnostic criteria for mycobacterial disaease. CONCLUSION: Microbiological analysis of an adequate number of samples in symptomatic patients with radiological features suggestive for NTM-related pulmonary disease increses the diagnostic sensitivity in pulmonary mycobacteriosis. Identification of the species in positive cultures is of great importance."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chart review was performed to identify all patients with a histologic diagnosis of granulomatous pneumonitis and positive cultures for MAC between January 1, 1995, and July 1, 2004. Individuals identified who also had a hot tub were included in the study. Twelve patients, seven females and five males with an average age of 50 years (range, 13-66 years), who had a CT scan were identified. The CT images were reviewed by two thoracic radiologists who assessed the images for the presence of any parenchymal abnormalities, including nodules, areas of ground-glass attenuation, reticular opacities, and air trapping, on expiratory images. When nodules, reticular opacities, areas of ground-glass attenuation, or a combination of these findings was present, the reviewers visually determined the extent of involvement of the lungs using a scale of &lt; 10%, 10-40%, or &gt; 40%. They also recorded the distribution of the involvement both cephalocaudal and transaxial. Decisions were reached by consensus of the reviewers. RESULTS: Nodules were present in 10 (83%) of 12 patients. In eight (80%) of 10 patients, the nodules were diffuse with a centrilobular distribution. In the other two, the nodules were randomly distributed with an upper lung predominance. In five patients the nodules showed areas of ground-glass attenuation, whereas in the other five the nodules were solid. Areas of ground-glass attenuation were present in eight (75%) of 12 patients and were bilateral in all cases. The areas of ground-glass attenuation were diffuse in the cephalocaudal plane with a random distribution in the transaxial plane in seven (88%) of eight cases. In the remaining case, the areas of ground-glass attenuation had a lower lung predominance with a random distribution in the transaxial plane. Expiratory images showed evidence of air trapping in all seven cases for which these images were available. In one patient, air trapping was the only abnormality identified. CONCLUSION: The CT findings in patients with hot tub lung include areas of ground-glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and air trapping on expiratory images. These findings are similar to previously published findings of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Therefore, in cases in which CT findings suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hot tub lung should also be a diagnostic consideration."

METHOD: In 2004 each of NZ's mycobacterium reference laboratories collected data on NTM isolates. The clinical significance of isolates was decided by contacting the requesting clinician. American Thoracic Society criteria were used to assign clinical significance to respiratory isolates. RESULTS: 368 patients had NTM isolated from various sites. 21% (78/368) were clinically significant [15% (47/316) of respiratory isolates, 100% (17/17) lymph node and 89% (8/9) of soft tissue isolates]. Of the significant isolates, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAIC) was the most common, accounting for 83%, 88%, and 44% of respiratory, lymph node, and soft tissue infections respectively. Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were the second most common cause of significant infection. Of 47 patients with significant respiratory isolates 79% were female and 83% had underlying lung disease. The incidence of disease caused by NTM in NZ in 2004 was 1.92/100,000 population. The specific incidence of pulmonary, lymph node and soft tissue infections was 1.17, 0.39, and 0.24 per 100,000 population respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM respiratory disease in NZ during 2004 is approximately twice that recorded for Australia in 2000 (0.56/100,000). MAIC is the most common pathogen, followed by RGM.

Pulmonary infections in RA patients who were taking TNFalpha inhibitors included 1 patient each with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Among the RA patients with lung abscess, malignancy was noted in 55.6%, and diabetes mellitus in 22.2%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second-most-common cause of pneumonia and cause of all exacerbations of bronchiectasis. As well as immunosuppressive medications (steroids, methotrexate, TNFalpha inhibitors) and systemic comorbid diseases, underlying lung diseases could be one of the risk factor for pulmonary infections in patients with RA. The dominant risk factor for each pulmonary infection in patients with RA might be different."

She suffered from nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), and her lung inflammation deteriorated due to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. Because of old age, dysphagia, esophageal hiatus hernia, gastro-esophageal reflux and her bedridden condition due to severe osteoporosis, oral nutritional supplementation is nearly impossible. To reduce the aspiration risk, we chose PEJ instead of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) as the route of tube feeding. Six months after the placement of a PEJ tube, aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed and she was readmitted to our hospital. During hospitalization, she had sudden diarrhea, vomiting, and lower abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scan and radiographs using contrast medium showed small intestinal intussusception related to the PEJ tube. We observed the clinical course without performing surgery, pulling it back towards the stomach and placing an ileus tube, because the small intestine was not completely obstructed. Two months later, although she suffered from aspiration pneumonia once more, she remained in a stable condition without further intervention so that she could move to aother hospital. Recently PEJ has been expected to prevent aspiration pneumonia, but we believe that it can be a risk factor for intussusception. Although the PEJ can be a good parenteral nutrition route for frail elderly with dysphagia, we need to consider possible complications including intussusception."

A chest x-ray showed interstitial infiltration over bilateral lung fields. A kidney biopsy showed immune complex-mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis and diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity with exudative neutrophils. Reactive NTM infection of the lungs was suspected when mycobacterial cultures of the sputum repeatedly yielded Mycobacterium avium. A lung biopsy revealed chronic inflammation without evidence of alveolar capillaritis. NTM pulmonary disease was further confirmed by tissue culture of the lung biopsy specimens. Anti-tuberculous drugs in combination with clarithromycin were given for the treatment of NTM infection. Because of the risk of aggravating underlying infectious disease, immunosuppressive therapy for crescentic glomerulonephritis was not carried out. Pulmonary symptoms promptly responded to treatment. Furthermore, renal function steadily improved after the initiation of anti-NTM therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with NTM infection."

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the morphotype, immunophenotype, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genotype in a large cohort with PNTM. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 63 patients with PNTM infection, each of whom had computerized tomography, echocardiogram, pulmonary function, and flow cytometry of peripheral blood. In vitro cytokine production in response to mitogen, LPS, and cytokines was performed. Anthropometric measurements were compared with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) age- and ethnicity-matched female control subjects extracted from the NHANES 2001-2002 dataset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 59.9 (+/-9.8 yr [SD]) old, and 5.4 (+/-7.9 yr) from diagnosis to enrollment. Patients were 95% female, 91% white, and 68% lifetime nonsmokers. A total of 46 were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex, M. xenopi, or M. kansasii; 17 were infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria. Female patients were significantly taller (164.7 vs. 161.0 cm; P &lt; 0.001) and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 28.2; P &lt; 0.001) than matched NHANES control subjects, and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 26.8; P = 0.002) than patients with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. A total of 51% of patients had scoliosis, 11% pectus excavatum, and 9% mitral valve prolapse, all significantly more than reference populations. Stimulated cytokine production was similar to that of healthy control subjects, including the IFN-gamma/IL-12 pathway. CD4(+), CD8(+), B, and natural killer cell numbers were normal. A total of 36% of patients had mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNTM infection are taller and leaner than control subjects, with high rates of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations, but without recognized immune defects."

However, NTM are a heterogeneous group and most of the data come from only three species: Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus. Still, information about these three species is confusing because it is based mainly on retrospective studies and series of clinical cases performed in developed countries. In recent years, new information has appeared about other species and the pathogenesis of NTM. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that NTM infection is a worldwide phenomenon with an increasing presence in developing countries perhaps because of the implementation of tap water. Women with characteristic phenotype are at higher risk of acquiring NTM infection along with patients with defects on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. New studies on Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium szulgai and Mycobacterium simiae indicate that the American Thoracic Society criteria for diagnosing NTM disease may not be useful for all species of NTM. SUMMARY: New multicentric and prospective studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of NTM. These organisms form a numerous and heterogeneous group and each species should be studied separately."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study (2001-2008) including all patients who met American Thoracic Society criteria for M. abscessus pulmonary disease. Our aim was the evaluation of clinical and microbiologic outcomes in patients treated with combined antibiotic and surgical therapy, compared with antibiotic therapy alone. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were predominantly female (83%) and never-smokers (60%), with a mean age of 60 years. Fifty-nine (55%) of 107 patients had coexistent or previous history of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary infection. High-resolution chest CT showed bronchiectasis and nodular opacities in 98% of patients and cavities in 44%. Sixty-nine (46 medical, 23 surgical) patients were followed up for a mean duration of 34 months (standard deviation, 21.1 months, range, 2-82 months). Cough, sputum production, and fatigue remained stable, improved, or resolved in 80%, 69%, and 59% of patients, respectively. Twenty (29%) of 69 patients remained culture positive, 16 (23%) converted but experienced relapse, 33 (48%) converted to negative and did not experience relapse, and 17 (16%) died during the study period. There were significantly more surgical patients than medical patients whose culture converted and remained negative for at least 1 year (57% vs 28%; P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with M. abscessus pulmonary disease who are treated with multidrug antibiotic therapy and surgery or antibiotic therapy alone had similar clinical outcomes.

During the study period, 50 patients with hematological malignancy and tuberculosis (TB) were also evaluated. Among 2,846 patients with hematological malignancy, 34 (1.2%) patients had NTM infections. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (13 patients, 38%) was the most commonly isolated species, followed by M. abscessus (21%), M. fortuitum (18%), and M. kansasii (18%). Twenty-six patients had pulmonary NTM infection and eight patients had disseminated disease. Neutropenia was more frequently encountered among patients with disseminated NTM disease (p = 0.007) at diagnosis than among patients with pulmonary disease only. Twenty-five (74%) patients received adequate initial antibiotic treatment. Five of the 34 patients died within 30 days after diagnosis. Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that chronic kidney disease (p = 0.017) and neutropenia at diagnosis (p = 0.032) were independent prognostic factors of NTM infection in patients with hematological malignancy. Patients with NTM infection had higher absolute neutrophil counts at diagnosis (p = 0.003) and a higher 30-day mortality rate (15% vs. 2%, p = 0.025) than TB patients.

Exacerbation of infectious pneumonitis and interstitial pneumonia required complementary inpatient treatment in August 2007. Although polymerase chain reaction examination of expectorated sputa revealed the absence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. intracellulare on admission, nontuberculous M. abscessus was detected in the routine blood cultures. Taken together with clinical findings, M. abscessus was most likely the primary causative organism. Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be highly helpful for diagnosis."

NTM are ubiquitous environmental pathogens with high isolation rates worldwide. The greater frequency of NTM associated with pulmonary diseases is probably due to a combination of increased exposure, improved diagnostic methods and an increase in the prevalence of risk factors predisposing individuals to infection. Difficulty may arise in determining whether an isolate from a respiratory sample is in fact a contaminant or a pathogenic organism. The ATS/IDSA guidelines highlight the importance of following microbiological and clinical criteria in making a diagnosis of NTM lung infection. These criteria may not be useful for all NTM and species-level identification is strongly recommended. Mycobacteria identification by conventional methods has been the standard in most clinical microbiology laboratories. However, conventional testing alone does not allow identification of many NTM. Newer, rapid molecular methods such as commercially available nucleic acid probes, genomic amplification and DNA sequence analysis should be used. Communication between the clinician and the laboratorian is essential to decide whether an isolate could be sent to a reference laboratory to determine the best method for species identification. Although the CLSI has recently published an approved standard for NTM susceptibility testing, there is ongoing debate about the role of in vitro susceptibility for managing patients with NTM disease. The goal of this review is to describe the mycobacteria involved in lung disease, the factors that predispose to this infection, its diagnosis with alternative procedures and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response."

This results, in part, from incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. OBJECTIVES: To study pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions of multidrug treatment regimens in a large cohort of patients with MAC lung disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected pharmacokinetic data of all patients treated for MAC lung disease in the Adult Care Unit at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, in the January 2006 to January 2010 period; we retrospectively calculated areas under the time-concentration curve (AUC). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of their MAC isolates were retrieved for pharmacodynamic calculations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 531 pharmacokinetic analyses, performed for 481 patients (84% females; mean age, 63 yr; mean body mass index, 21.6). Peak serum concentrations (C(max)) below target range were frequent for ethambutol (48% of patients); clarithromycin (56%); and azithromycin (35%). Concurrent administration of rifampicin led to 68%, 23%, and 10% decreases in C(max) of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin. C(max)/MIC or AUC/MIC ratios associated with bactericidal activity were seldom met; 57% of patients achieved target ratios for ethambutol, versus 42% for clarithromycin, 19% for amikacin, 18% for rifampicin, and 11% for moxifloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Currently recommended regimens for MAC lung disease yield important pharmacologic interactions and low concentrations of key drugs including macrolides. Pharmacodynamic indices for rifampicin, clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin are seldom met. This may partly explain the poor outcomes of currently recommended treatment regimens.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the natural course of MAC pulmonary disease by serial thin-section computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Of 339 patients with nodular bronchiectatic form of MAC disease, we selected 265 untreated patients who had serial CTs (mean observation period, 32 +- 21 mo). Two independent chest radiologists reviewed retrospectively all CT scans for the presence and extent of lung abnormalities (maximal total score, 30). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 265 patients, 126 patients (48%) had disease that had progressed and that needed treatment owing to radiologic deterioration or worsening symptoms, and the remaining 139 patients (52%) did not. On multivariate analysis, the presence of cavity (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.06; P = 0.004) and consolidation (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; P = 0.019) at initial CT remained as independent factors associated with disease progression and treatment requirement. The presence of cavitary lesions demonstrated the highest positive predictive value (61%) and significant correlation (P = 0.005) with smear positivity. Differences in the extent of each pattern and total CT score in the serial studies were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.05) in patients requiring treatment. The total CT score increased by 2.41 in the treatment-requiring group compared with 0.25 in the group that did not receive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Without treatment, about half of patients demonstrate progressive disease on serial CT over a mean follow-up period of 32 months and, thus, required treatment. Patients showing cavities or consolidation on initial CT are more likely to have progressive disease and thus to require treatment eventually."

We found the low prevalence of AIDS-defining illnesses in central neural system in this study, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (4.4%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (3.5%), tuberculosis meningitis (3.2%), cryptococcal meningitis (2.4%) and CMV encephalitis (1.1%). In-hospital mortality rate was 4.3 per 100 person-years due to severe OIs, malignancies, and medical cost constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and spectrums of OIs, malignancies and co-infections were discussed in this study. It would help increase the awareness for physicians to make a diagnosis and empirical treatment sooner and plan good management strategies, especially in resource limited regions."

METHODS: We retrospectively selected 220 patients who satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NTM disease proposed by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Nine patients with pulmonary NTM disease were complicated with pneumothorax. We investigated the patients' background, laboratory findings, radiological findings, treatment and prognoses. RESULTS: There were nine patients, including six men and three women, with a mean age of 73.2 years. Seven patients had underlying respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) excluding pulmonary NTM disease. The causative microorganisms was Mycobacterium avium in four patients, M. intracellulare in four patients, and M. kansasii in one patient. Regarding the radiological findings, pneumothorax was recognized in the right lung in five patients, in the left lung in three patients, and in both lungs heterogeneously in one patient. Although most patients exhibited multiple cavities and extensive lesions over the unilateral lung fields, three patients were simultaneously diagnosed with pulmonary NTM disease at the onset of pneumothorax. As for treatment, thoracic drainage was performed in seven patients, while one patient was advised only to rest and one patient required both thoracic drainage and surgery. The responses to the treatment was poor in each case, and five patients died due to pneumonia or heart failure. CONCLUSION: In this study, the rate of pneumothorax complications in the patients with pulmonary NTM disease (4.1%) was higher than that of other reports. The responses to treatment, and prognoses were poor due to the presence of other complications."

Chest auscultation revealed an expiratory wheezing with decreased right-sided breath sounds. Chest imaging revealed subcarinal adenopathy and a nodule in the right principal bronchus (RB). Bronchoscopy showed a major obstruction of the RB by a granuloma, and a smaller granuloma in the left principal bronchus. The granulation tissue was removed by laser section. Histological examination revealed a necrotising granulomatous inflammation, culture showed a Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Tests to rule out tuberculosis and immunodeficiency were negative. The diagnosis of an MAC endobronchial granuloma was ascertained and a multidrug therapy associating clarithromycin, rifampin and ethambutol was started. The clinical outcome was good after 3 months of treatment and the bronchoscopy normalised after 1 year. Although rare, the frequency of MAC respiratory infections in immunocompetent children can increase. Reporting these cases should help to optimise diagnosis and treatment. "

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL &lt;0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration."

The risk for MAC in AIDS patients is greatest in those with severely depressed CD4 count. The organs most commonly involved in disseminated MAC infection include spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and intestines. The involvement of peritoneum by MAC infection is rare. This is a case of MAC peritonitis in a 26-year-old female AIDS patient who is noncompliant to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This patient presented with abdominal pain and distension, anorexia, diarrhea, and cough. She was treated with rifabutin, clarithromycin, and ethambutol along with atovaquone for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis and so the patient's condition improved.

To elucidate clinicopathological features of these rare cases, we examined PAS cases determined by histological examination of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) specimens. METHODS: Of 6105 TBLB cases investigated from 1990 to 2007, 11 were diagnosed as PAS based on histology. Of these, we examined 9 records in detail, as the medical records for 2 cases were unavailable. RESULTS: Histopathological findings indicated 8 patients with aspiration pneumonia and 1 with diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis. However, the pre-bronchoscopy diagnoses included lung cancer, mycobacteriosis, organizing pneumonia, repetitive pneumonia, fungal infection, and interstitial pneumonia. PAS was not considered before TBLB. Only 4 of the 9 patients developed subjective symptoms including fever and cough with sputum production. Laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of white blood cell (WBC) count in only 1 patient and elevation of C reactive protein (CRP) level in 4 patients. Radiographic examination revealed abnormal findings in the dorsal right lower lobes, which was the most vulnerable site for aspiration pneumonia, and also in the upper and ventral portions of the lung. Although the characteristic findings of PAS were scarce, all patients had conditions predisposing to aspiration; i.e., gastrectomy, excessive alcohol drinking, post-cerebral infarction, and sinobronchial syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: We diagnosed 9 PAS patients on the basis of histological findings that were distinct from clinical findings. Despite presenting with variable symptoms and laboratory and radiographic findings, they all exhibited predisposing factors to aspiration."

METHODS: We used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan in this study. The NTM cohort contained 3,005 patients, and each case was randomly frequency matched by age, sex, income, occupation, and index year with four people from the general population without NTM infections. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of COPD in the NTM cohort compared with the non-NTM cohort. RESULTS: The incidence of COPD was 3.08-fold higher (21.75 vs. 6.11 per 1,000 person-years) in the NTM cohort than in the non-NTM cohort. The aHR of COPD comparing the NTM cohort with the non-NTM cohort was 3.57 (95 % CI 2.56-4.97) for women and 2.89 (95 % CI 2.31-3.61) for men. The aHR of COPD was higher in the patients with NTM infection and a comorbidity such as bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease. The Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex group (MAC) and the non-MAC group were isolated in the NTM cohort. The MAC group had a higher aHR of COPD than the non-NTM cohort (aHR = 3.72, 95 % CI 2.94-4.72). The cumulative incidence of COPD in the NTM cohort was higher than in the non-NTM cohort (P &lt; 0.0001, log rank test).

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium aviumID:24740640TITLE:Surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.ABSTRACT:While the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been decreasing, the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease has been increasing. Unlike tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is not communicable. However, their indolent nature may result in extensive parenchymal destruction, causing respiratory failure and vulnerability to airway infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, therefore, has been becoming a significant health problem. According to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement on nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, the primary treatment is a multidrug treatment regimen. However, its efficacy is less than satisfactory for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, which is the most common type of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, and for Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease, which is notoriously resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The statement, therefore, has proposed a multidisciplinary treatment approach for these types of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases: a combination of multidrug treatment regimen and adjuvant resectional surgery. This review covers the rationale, indication, procedure, and outcome of surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. The rationale of surgery is to prevent disease progressing by removing the areas of lung most affected, harboring the largest amounts of mycobacteria. The indications for surgery include a poor response to drug therapy, the development of macrolide-resistant disease, or the presence of a significant disease-related complication such as hemoptysis. The surgical procedures of choice are various types of pulmonary resections, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. The reported series have achieved favorable treatment outcomes in surgically treated patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. "

A preliminary study.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: For unclear reasons, the phenotypical hosts for nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infection are often thin, elderly, white women without underlying lung disease. As these women are usually postmenopausal, we hypothesized that a state of relative hormone deficiency may predispose some women to pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a prospective cross-sectional study to assess for alterations in systemic levels of sex hormones in patients with confirmed pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection compared with healthy control subjects. METHODS: Female patients with pulmonary M. avium complex infection (n = 35) were recruited along with similar-aged control subjects (n = 27) without lung disease from the general population of our institution. Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), estrone, and ultrasensitive estradiol were measured from sampled blood. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: DHEA-S levels of patients with M. avium complex infection were significantly lower than control subjects (mean 33 mug/dl vs. 59 mug/dl, P = 0.001). No significant difference was found in the levels of estrone (mean, 27 pg/ml vs. 28 pg/ml, P = 0.665) or ultrasensitive estradiol (mean, 9 pg/ml vs. 9 pg/ml, P = 0.364). Patients with M. avium complex had a lower body mass index (BMI) than control subjects (mean, 22 vs. 26, P = 0.001). There was no association between levels of DHEA-S, estrone, or estradiol, and BMI or age. CONCLUSIONS: Women with M. avium complex infection had lower DHEA-S levels, but not lower estrogen levels, compared with control subjects. There was no relationship between BMI and hormone levels in the study population. Further study of these hormonal effects on immune function in nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is warranted."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary NTM infection and pulmonary NTM disease. METHODS: A retrospective review of the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens from January 2007 to May 2013. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were identified with at least one respiratory NTM isolate and 56 patients (46%) fulfilled the microbiological ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. Of patients with adequate data, 16% fulfilled the complete ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. The incidence of pulmonary NTM infection and disease was 18.9 and 8.8 per 100.000 inpatients and outpatients, respectively. The spectrum of NTM species was high (13 species) and predominated by M. avium-intracellulare complex (M. avium (13%), M. intracellulare (10%)), M. gordonae (14%), and M. fortuitum (12%). The ratio of isolation of NTM to M. tuberculosis in all hospitalized patients was 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: The first data on the epidemiology of pulmonary NTM in Athens, Greece, are presented. NTM infection is common in patients with chronic respiratory disease. However, only a significantly smaller proportion of patients fulfill the criteria for NTM disease."

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

We investigated the characteristics and clinical impact of NTM isolation in this population. Medical records of adult patients who underwent SCT at the blood and marrow transplantation center at a University Hospital in South Korea between January 2004 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five of 2,658 patients were enrolled, an incidence of 0.94%. The most common NTM species isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 15) and Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 5). Sixteen patients were co-infected with other pathogens, including Aspergillus species (10 cases). Nonspecific pneumonia and cavitary pneumonia were the most common radiologic patterns. Sixteen patients had underlying lung graft-versus-host disease, including bronchiolitis obliterans (10 cases) with moderate obstructive lung defects. Whereas two of 10 patients who were treated for NTM died as a result of NTM progression, one of 15 patients who were not treated died of the same cause. This study shows that the incidence of respiratory NTM detection in SCT recipients was low and its virulence was not higher than expected. As patients frequently had concomitant infections and underlying lung diseases that made radiologic evaluation more difficult, we suggest that it would be advantageous to perform repeated microbiologic studies when NTM infection is clinically suspected."

In total, 452 nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains isolated from patients with NTM lung diseases in four specialised TB hospitals were enrolled in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to evaluate the drug susceptibility of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM lung diseases caused by M. avium and M. intracellulare were analysed. Of 452 NTM isolates, M. intracellulare (188; 41.6%) was the most frequently isolated organism. The percentages of moxifloxacin- and linezolid-resistant strains among the M. intracellulare isolates were significantly lower than those among the M. avium group (P=0.003 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, M. avium harboured a lower proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains than M. intracellulare (P=0.005).

In conclusion, these data demonstrated that M. intracellulare was the most common NTM species in China. This study also revealed that M. intracellulare and M. avium differed in their drug susceptibility profiles.

Most previous studies focused mainly on tuberculosis (TB) rather than NTM infections. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical features of mycobacterial infections, from both MTB and NTM in HIV-infected patients in Siriraj Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study of adult HIV-infected patients in Infectious Disease Clinic, Siriraj Hospital, was conducted. Clinical characteristics and factors associated with mycobacterial infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 253 patients enrolled, 65 (25.7%) developed mycobacterial infections, in which 56 patients (86%) were tuberculosis (TB), whereas NTM was diagnosed in 9 (14%). Of these 65 patients, 45 (69.2%) were culture-proven, 14 (21.6%) were diagnosed TB by positive acid-fast bacilli smears and 6 (9.2%) were diagnosed TB by clinical response to anti-tuberculosis treatment only. Among culture-positive patients, MTB was found in 36 (80%) and NTM in 9 (20%), in which Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the most common among NTMisolates (n = 5),followed by unidentifiable slowly-growing mycobacteria (n = 3) and M. fortuitum (n = 1). Among patients with MTB infection, 58.3% were disseminated. The most affected organ in patients with mycobacterial infections was lung (75%), followed by lymph node (66.7%). Factors associated with mycobacterial infections included male gender (64.6% vs. 54.3%; p = 0.026), higher HIV Viral load (1.04 x 10(6) VS. 0.3 x 10(6); p = 0.004), lower hematocrit (32.7% vs. 35.3%; p = 0.032) and higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (146 U/L vs. 107 U/L;p = 0.032). In contrast, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was negatively associated with mycobacterial infections in HIV-infected individuals (28.8% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.004). Favorable treatment response was 86.1% and 77.8% for MTB and NTM infection, respectively, and the 6-month mortality rates were 2.78% and 11.1% for MTB and NTM infection, respectively. In patients who received treatment for TB, 22.2% had hepatitis, 13.9% had drug allergy and 8.3% had immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. CONCLUSION: Disseminated infection is the most common form of mycobacterial infection in HIV-infected patients, resulting in anemia and high ALP levels. PCP was negatively associated with mycobacterial infection. MAC is the most common of the NTM isolates in HIV-infected patients."

We present the first case of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-associated IRIS (MAC-IRIS) that was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old homosexual Japanese man was referred to our hospital with fever and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and found to be HIV positive. After the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the patient's mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy gradually enlarged, and bilateral infiltrates appeared in the upper lung fields. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed five months after the initiation of cART and showed intense accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) corresponding to the lesions of infiltration as well as the mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. A bronchial wash culture and pathology findings led to a diagnosis of MAC-IRIS. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy with rifampicin, ethambutol, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin was started. One year after the chemotherapy was initiated, there was a significant reduction in FDG uptake in the area of the lesions except in the mediastinal lymph node. This implied incomplete resolution of the MAC-IRIS-related inflammation. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy was continued because of the residual lesion. To date, the patient has not experienced a recurrence of MAC-IRIS, a period of nine months. CONCLUSION: We present a case of MAC-IRIS in an HIV-infected patient whose disease activity was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our data suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for evaluating the disease activity of NTM-IRIS and assessing the appropriate duration of anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy for NTM-IRIS in HIV-infected patients."

Most patients (95%) converted from positive to negative sputum culture results in an average of 4.5 +- 4.2 months (range, 0-30 months). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with clofazimine converted to negative culture results compared with those treated with rifampin (100% vs 71%; P = .0002). Microbiologic relapse occurred in 52 of 107 patients (49%). Thirty-six percent of patients required retreatment. There was no difference in microbiologic relapse or re-treatment rates between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with MAC lung disease achieve negative sputum culture results. Re-treatment is needed in approximately one-third of patients. In this cohort, both initial outcomes and re-treatment rates were at least as good in patients treated with clofazimine-containing regimens as in patients receiving rifampin-containing regimens. Clofazimine should be considered as an alternative drug for the treatment of MAC lung disease."

A Prospective Cohort Study.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: Mycobacterium abscessus group lung infection is characterized by low cure rates. Improvement in quality of life may be a reasonable treatment goal. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate change in quality of life in response to therapy, predictors of improvement in quality of life, and association of quality of life with traditional outcome measures. METHODS: Forty-seven patients were treated for Mycobacterium abscessus group lung infection (including one with Mycobacterium chelonae) and were followed prospectively for 2 years between December 2009 and May 2012. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was administered, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging was carried out, and culture data were collected at multiple time points. Predictors of improvement in the SGRQ total score greater than or equal to a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) at 12 months were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 85% female and 94% white, with a mean age of 65 years. Nine (20%) had a genetic diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (none F508del homozygous). Coinfection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurred in 28% and Pseudomonas in 26%. Chest CT imaging universally indicated bronchiectasis and nodules; 51% had lung cavities. Treatment included a mean of 17 months of antibiotics, and lung resection in 34%. Seventeen patients with M. avium complex (36%) and one with Mycobacterium kansasii were treated for coinfection. The mean SGRQ total score (SD) at baseline was 35 (20). At all follow-up time points, the mean SGRQ total score (SD) was significantly lower (better) than at baseline: 27 (17) at 3 months, P &lt; 0.01; 27 (19) at 6 months, P &lt; 0.01; 27 (20) at 12 months, P &lt; 0.01; and 30 (22) at 24 months, P = 0.02. At 12 and 24 months, respectively, 60% and 56% had improvement greater than or equal to the MCID in SGRQ total score. Improvement greater than or equal to the MCID at 12 months was positively associated with a history of respiratory exacerbation, isolate susceptible to imipenem-cilastatin, and lung resection surgery, and negatively associated with nodules &gt;4 mm in diameter on chest CT imaging, but these associations were not statistically significant in multivariable analysis. At 24 months, 16 patients (48%) with complete data were culture negative for 1 year and had discontinued M. abscessus group treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life was a sensitive indicator of treatment response and has the potential to be a useful parameter to guide treatment."

Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility. METHODS: Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria. RESULTS: Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

The AIDS-defining opportunistic infections most common in the United States include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Candida esophagitis, toxoplasmic encephalitis, tuberculosis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococcal meningitis, and cytomegalovirus retinitis. Specific prophylaxis regimens exist for several opportunistic infections, and effective antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of most others. Other AIDS-defining conditions include wasting syndrome and HIV encephalopathy. AIDS-defining malignancies include Kaposi sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer. Although not an AIDS-defining condition, anal cancer is common in patients with HIV infection.

We report a case of mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection whose disease activity was correlated with KL-6 levels in serum. During treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) with prednisolone, chest image findings improved in association with decreased KL-6 levels. Following tapering of prednisolone, chest image findings deteriorated again as levels of KL-6 increased, suggesting recurrence of RA-ILD. Bronchoscopic examination revealed active MAC infection. Treatment of MAC infection not only improved chest image findings but also decreased KL-6 levels in serum, suggesting that KL-6 was increased by active MAC infection by itself, not by recurrence of RA-ILD.

A common radiological feature in pulmonary MAC infection is a mixture of two basic patterns: fibrocavitary and nodular bronchiectatic; however, lobar consolidation is rare. We report an 83-year-old man with lobar caseous pneumonia caused by pulmonary MAC infection. Radiological findings were predominantly composed of dense lobar consolidation and ground-glass opacity. A diagnosis was made in accordance with the clinical and microbiological criteria set by the American Thoracic Society. A histological examination of lung specimens obtained by using a bronchoscope revealed a caseous granulomatous inflammation with an appearance of Langhans cells. The patient was treated using combined mycobacterium chemotherapy with an initial positive response for 6 months; however, the disease progressed later. We suggest that an awareness of lobar pneumonic consolidation as a rare radiological finding in pulmonary MAC infection is important. "

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) is the most frequent AIDS-defining illness. However, PCP can also rarely occur during primary HIV infection as a result of the severe immunosuppression that may accompany the early stage of HIV infection. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) comprises two distinct syndromes: paradoxical IRIS and unmasking IRIS. Infections with Mycobacterium avium complex during antiretroviral therapy are almost always localized and related to IRIS.

The development of molecular methods has allowed the characterization of new species and the identification of NTM to the precise species and subspecies levels. The incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease are increasing worldwide, and this syndrome accounts for the majority of clinical cases of NTM disease. Common causative organisms of pulmonary infection are the slowly growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium kansasii and the rapidly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex. NTM lung disease often affects elderly people with chronic lung disease and may be a manifestation of a complex genetic disorder determined by interactions among multiple genes, as well as environmental exposures. To be diagnosed with NTM lung disease, patients should meet all clinical and microbiologic criteria, but the decision to start treatment is complex, requiring careful individualized analysis of risks and benefits. Clinicians should be alert to the unique aspects of NTM lung disease, including the need for proper diagnosis, the availability of advanced molecular methods for species and subspecies identification, and the benefits and limitations of recommended treatments."

We hypothesized an association between pulmonary MAI infection and Th2-type immune responses as seen in allergy. METHODS: Biomarkers of patient Th2-type immune responses (peripheral blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE levels) were compared between patients with positive pulmonary samples for tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. A further comparison of clinical characteristics, including respiratory co-morbidities, and biomarkers, was conducted between patients culturing MAI NTM and those culturing NTM other than MAI. RESULTS: Patients culturing NTM from pulmonary samples had significantly higher peripheral blood eosinophil levels than those culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, patients culturing MAI compared to those culturing NTM other than MAI had higher eosinophil counts (mean 0.29x109/L vs 0.15x109/L, p = 0.010) and IgE levels (geometric mean 138kU/L vs 47kU/L, p = 0.021). However there was no significant difference in the frequency of asthma between the two NTM groups.

However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of PNTM-associated CPA. In the present investigation, we aimed to elucidate the clinical course and prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 62 patients with CPA and a history of PNTM who were admitted to Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center between 2010 and 2015. Co-morbidities, causative microorganisms, radiological findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 69.5 years, and the median follow-up period was 4.2 years. The major underlying diseases, other than PNTM and CPA, were old pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia. The most common causative NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC; 37 patients; 59.7%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (20 patients; 32.3%). Survival was 83% after 1 year and 61% after 5 years. Use of systemic corticosteroids (hazard ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-9.51; P=0.00177) and C-reactive protein levels &gt;= 5.0 mg/dL (hazard ratio: 8.96, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-62.9; P=0.0014) at the time of CPA diagnosis were associated with increased over-all mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CPA frequently developed in patients with MAC and M. kansasii PNTM. The treatment course of PNTM was not associated with all-cause mortality. However, systemic corticosteroid use and high CRP levels were negative prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. Since the prognosis is poor, early diagnosis and treatment of CPA are important in patients with PNTM."

In such cases, Occam's razor need not apply: multiple infections and malignancies are often present concurrently upon presentation to care. A patient off anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for several years developed advanced HIV infection (CD4 count 19 cells/uL) and presented with five simultaneous opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bloodstream infection, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia. Simultaneously, he was found to have primary central nervous system (CNS) B-cell lymphoma. Treatment decisions for such patients are often complex, as ideal therapy for one disease may directly counter or interact with therapy for another. For instance, methotrexate for primary CNS lymphoma and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for PJP is a strictly contraindicated medication combination. It is important to understand not just the management of any single opportunistic disease in patients with advanced HIV, but how to balance management for patients with a variety of concurrent processes. In an era when HIV care is becoming increasingly simplified, patients presenting with advanced infection highlight the lack of data on how best to manage patients with multiple concurrent disease processes.

METHODS: One hundred and eight patients underwent adjuvant lung resection for MAC-LD at two hospitals between January 2008 and July 2016. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes and risk factors. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (13%). After lung resection, 98 out of 108 patients (91%) achieved sputum culture conversion, eight (8.2%) of whom developed microbiological recurrence during the follow-up period. As a result, the success rate of adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD with drug resistance was 83%. A multivariable analysis showed that a longer period from the initial medical treatment to surgery (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.02; p = 0.008) was independently associated with an increased risk of unfavorable outcomes after adjuvant surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD have acceptable outcomes. Better control of the disease may be achieved in some patients with drug resistance and indications for surgery through surgical treatments, and pulmonary resection needs to be performed earlier rather than continuing chemotherapy in these patients because it reduces unfavorable outcomes."

Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common involved pathogen, followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (MABSC), while Mycobacterium kansasii is not a major concern. The rate of infection rate in lung transplant recipients is reported to range from 1.5-22.4%. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here four cases of NTM pulmonary infection and disease among 63 patients who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at our hospital. Those four occurred following living-donor transplantation in two patients, one with pulmonary arterial hypertension and one with bronchiectasia, and deceased donor lung transplantation in two patients, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and interstitial pneumonia, respectively. NTM was not detected in any of the patients prior to transplantation. The involved pathogens were Mycobacterium gordonae in one, MAC in one, and MABSC in two of these patients, which were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in two and sputum in two. The one case of MAC and two of MABSC were symptomatic with consolidation shown in chest CT images indicating possible pneumonia, while the one with M. gordonae had no symptoms and was detected by surveillance BAL. Onset time from detection of NTM was greater than 3 years in the three with MABSC and M. gordonae and less than 3 years in the one with MAC. Each patient required a decrease in immunosuppressive agents according to their condition, while antibiotics therapy was performed in the three who were symptomatic. Sputum culture findings became negative after several months and were maintained thereafter in all. CONCLUSION: An NTM infection leading to pulmonary disease can occur at any time following lung transplantation. Treatment should be considered depending on the involved pathogens, individual status, and disease severity."

METHODS: Minocycline MICs for 55 MAC clinical isolates from the Netherlands were determined. We also co-incubated primary isolated macrophages infected with MAC with minocycline. Next, we performed a 28 day HFS-MAC model dose-response study in which we mimicked pulmonary concentration-time profiles achieved in patients.

We identified the AUC0-24/MIC ratios associated with 1.0 log10 cfu/mL kill below day 0 (stasis), defined as a bactericidal effect. We then performed 10000 Monte Carlo experiments to identify the optimal dose for a bactericidal effect in patients. RESULTS: The MIC for 50% and 90% of cumulative clinical isolates was 8 and 64 mg/L, respectively. Minocycline decreased MAC bacterial burden below stasis in primary isolated macrophages. In the HFS-MAC model, minocycline achieved a microbial kill of 3.6 log10 cfu/mL below stasis. The AUC0-24/MIC exposure associated with a bactericidal effect was 59. Monte Carlo experiments identified a minocycline susceptibility MIC breakpoint of 16 mg/L. At this proposed breakpoint, the clinical dose of 200 mg/day achieved the bactericidal effect exposure target in ~50% of patients, while 400 mg/day achieved this in 73.6% of patients, in Monte Carlo experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline at a dose of 400 mg/day is expected to be bactericidal. We propose a clinical trial for validation."

Methods: We conducted a case-control study. Seventeen of 7013 patients with SARD fulfilling the criteria for pulmonary NTM infection were enrolled in the NTM group. The control group was matched for age, sex, and SARD at a ratio of 2:1. Results: Eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis, four with systemic vasculitis, three with Sjogren's syndrome, and one each with dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus were included in the NTM group. Mycobacterium avium was detected in 12 (71%) patients, M. chelonae in 2, and M. intracellulare, M. abscessus, and M. kansasii in 1 patient each. Preexisting lung disease was more common in the NTM group than in the control group (88% versus 38%, p = .0009), particularly bronchiectasis (65% versus 29%, p = .033). The body mass index and serum albumin level were significantly lower in the NTM group than in the control group. Six patients (35%) experienced NTM exacerbation during observation. Clinical immune status at the time of NTM diagnosis, as indicated by the peripheral blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and serum immunoglobulin G level, was unremarkable and comparable between patients with and without exacerbation, as were the treatments for SARD. Conclusions: In patients with SARD, pulmonary NTM infection may develop and exacerbate without clinically apparent immunosuppression."

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

NTM were identified in different clinical samples by microbiological culture and molecular-based methods. NTM were isolated from 14 patients, out of whom four (27%) were infected and were treated accordingly. Two were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), two with M. abscessus complex (MABSC) and one with M. intracellulare. Two patients had cystic fibrosis-related lung disease and improved after successful NTM eradication. One patient was HIV-positive and died. One patient had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-related pneumonia and is currently being followed-up. We conclude that NTM frequency in our center was low among pediatric patients. Whether this is inherent to Brazilian patients, due to the broad coverage of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine in Brazil, or a result of underdiagnosis remains to be elucidated."

In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

Accumulating data suggests higher rates of bronchiectasis among the HIV-positive population. This case series involves 14 patients with bronchiectasis and HIV followed at two major urban institutions from 1999 to 2018. Demographics, clinical presentation, microbiology, radiographic imaging, and outcomes were collected and compiled. Mean age was 42 years (range 12-77 years). 36% had a CD4 count greater than 500 cells/mm3, 28% had a CD4 count between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, and 36% had AIDS. 43% were treated for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and 50% for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. 21% had COPD, 7% had asthma, and 7% had a history of pulmonary aspergillosis. Two patients were followed up by pulmonary services after diagnosis of bronchiectasis on CT. The timeline of the follow-up in these cases was within months and after three years respectively. It is posited that the prevalence of bronchiectasis in HIV patients may be underestimated. Improving recognition and management of bronchiectasis could help diminish rehospitalization rates."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

Recently, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that detects serum IgA antibody against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core antigen had been developed and found to be useful in discriminating MAC-PD from other lung diseases. The antibody was subsequently also found to be elevated in patients suffering Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary diseases (MAB-PD). This study is to evaluate this EIA kit in the serological diagnosis of MAC-PD in Hong Kong Chinese patients. Methods: The study was conducted in Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong between July 2017 and July 2018. Assay of the IgA antibody level using the EIA kit was done on blood samples collected from patients suffering from MAC-PD, MAB-PD, pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases. Results: There were 100 subjects recruited into the study, among which 11 were excluded. By using the cut-off value 0.7 U/mL provided by the manufacturer, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis were 73.7% and 77.6% for MAC-PD; 50% and 77.6% for MAB-PD. By receiver operating characteristic curves analysis, new cut-off for MAC-PD and MAB-PD were calculated as 1.771 U/mL and 0.172 U/m, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 68.4% and 86.2% for MAC-PD, whereas 66.7% and 72.4% for MAB-PD. Conclusions: Our study showed that the enzyme immunoassay of IgA antibodies against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid core antigen could help to distinguishing MAC and M. abscessus pulmonary diseases from pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases among Hong Kong Chinese patients. Further larger scale studies in our local population for the usefulness of this antibody test in the diagnosis and monitoring of MAC and M. abscessus lung diseases might be warranted."

The risk factors for hemoptysis are not well understood. In the current study, potential risk factors for hemoptysis were investigated in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease, which is the most common NTM in Japan. METHODS: Medical records from the Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center were reviewed. Consecutive patients with MAC lung disease diagnosed in 2014 and followed up for more than 1 year in the hospital were included in the study. Hemoptysis was confirmed between 2014 and 2016. The characteristics of patients with hemoptysis and non-hemoptysis at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease were obtained from the medical records, and the two groups were compared. The radiological findings assessed included nodules, infiltration shadows, cavities, and bronchiectasis. Each was classified and scored individually in six lung fields, and these data were used to generate radiological scores. RESULTS: The study included 82 patients with MAC lung disease, 18 with hemoptysis and 64 without. Higher total radiological severity score at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC was associated with an increased risk of hemoptysis. Among the radiological scores, infiltration and cavities were marginally associated with the risk of hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS: The radiological severity score at the time of initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease was associated with hemoptysis."

However, a large-scale epidemiological study on this issue in Korea is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of NTM infection after lung transplant surgery in Korea. METHODS: Between October 2012 and December 2018, we retrospectively evaluated lung transplant recipients in a referral hospital in South Korea. A total of 215 recipients were enrolled. The median age at transplantation was 56 years (range, 17-75), and 62% were men. Bronchoscopy was performed according to the surveillance protocol and clinical indications. A diagnosis of NTM infection was defined as a positive NTM culture from a bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample, or two separate sputum samples. We determined NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America 2007 guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for conditional survival analysis in patients with follow-up of >=12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6.5%) were diagnosed with NTM infection at a median of 11.8 months (range, 0.3-51.4) after transplantation. Nine patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with NTM-PD, and the incidence rate was 1980/100,000 person-years. Mycobacterium abscessus was the most common species causing NTM-PD (66%), followed by M. avium complex (33%). The presence of NTM infection did not influence all-cause mortality among those who underwent follow-up for >=12 months (N = 133, log-rank P = 0.816). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM-PD was considerably high among lung-transplant recipients. M. abscessus was the most common causative species of NTM-PD after lung transplantation."

The initial treatment effort may not be solely directed at MAC infection, rather it is often initiating airway clearance measures for bronchiectasis. The next important steps are deciding who to treat and when to initiate therapy. Definitive or unambiguous guidance for these decisions is often elusive. The evidence supporting the current macrolide-based regimen for treating MAC lung disease is compelling. This regimen has been recommended in consensus nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) treatment guidelines from 1997, 2007 and 2020, although clinician compliance with these recommendations is inconsistent. Understanding the idiosyncrasies of MAC antibiotic resistance is crucial for optimal antibiotic management. As a corollary, the importance of avoiding development of macrolide resistance due to inadequate therapy cannot be overstated. An inhaled liposome amikacin preparation is now approved for treating refractory MAC lung disease and holds promise for an even broader role in MAC therapy. Surgery is also an important therapeutic adjunct for selected patients. Microbiologic recurrences due either to new infection or treatment relapse/failure are common and require the same level of rigorous assessment and clinical judgement for determining their significance as initial MAC isolates. In summary, management of MAC lung disease patients is rarely straight forward and requires familiarity with multiple factors directly and indirectly related to MAC lung disease. The many nuances of MAC lung disease therapy defy simple treatment algorithms but with patience, attention to detail and perseverance, the outcome for most patients is favorable."

NTM are generally considered to be less virulent than Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, these organisms can cause diseases in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. As compared to tuberculosis, person-to-person transmission does not occur except with M. abscessus NTM species among cystic fibrosis patients. Lung is the most commonly involved organ, and the NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) occurs frequently in patients with pre-existing lung disease. NTM may also present as localized disease involving extrapulmonary sites such as lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues and rarely bones. Disseminated NTM disease is rare and occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired immune defects such as HIV/AIDS. Rapid molecular tests are now available for confirmation of NTM diagnosis at species and subspecies level. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) is not routinely done except in non-responsive disease due to slowly growing mycobacteria ( M. avium complex, M. kansasii) or infection due to rapidly growing mycobacteria, especially M. abscessus. While the decision to treat the patients with NTM-PD is made carefully, the treatment is given for 12 months after sputum culture conversion. Additional measures include pulmonary rehabilitation and correction of malnutrition. Treatment response in NTM-PD is variable and depends on isolated NTM species and severity of the underlying PD. Surgery is reserved for patients with localized disease with good pulmonary functions. Future research should focus on the development and validation of non-culture-based rapid diagnostic tests for early diagnosis and discovery of newer drugs with greater efficacy and lesser toxicity than the available ones."

Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and February 2019, 18 cases of NTM were diagnosed and their relevant clinical, diagnostic, and treatment details were recorded after taking informed consent. Results: We report 18 cases of NTM involving lungs (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), joint (n = 2), genitourinary (n = 1), and central nervous system (n = 1). History of immunosuppression was present in two patients, whereas history of some form of intervention was seen in six patients.

However, the clinical impact of subsequent new-onset NTM-PD in bronchiectasis patients has not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical courses and radiographic changes of patients with bronchiectasis in whom NTM-PD subsequently developed. METHODS: A total of 221 patients with bronchiectasis who had participated in a non-NTM bronchiectasis cohort between July 1st 2011 and August 31st 2019 at Seoul National University Hospital were included in this study. The data of patients in whom NTM-PD developed during this observation period were analyzed; specifically, changes in the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and lesions on computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest arising during the observation period. RESULTS: During the observation period, NTM was isolated from 35 patients. A total of 31 patients (14.0%) satisfied the diagnostic criteria of NTM-PD. The median time from enrollment in the cohort to the development of subsequent NTM-PD was 37 months (Interquartile range [IQR], 18-78 months). Mycobacterium avium complex was the most common pathogen (80.6%). Twelve patients underwent antibiotic treatment for NTM-PD with a median interval of 20 months (IQR, 13-30) from the time of NTM-PD diagnosis. When NTM-PD developed, the severity and extent of bronchiectasis, cellular bronchiolitis, and the extent of nodules worsened on CT scans, while BSI did not change. CONCLUSIONS: NTM-PD can develop in previously negative bronchiectasis patients. It is associated with worsening radiographic lesions. Active screening of non-NTM bronchiectasis patients for new-onset NTM infection should be considered, especially if radiographic findings worsen. The BSI is not a reliable predictor of new-onset NTM-PD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was performed at Seoul National University Hospital ( NCT01616745 )."

METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients who were newly diagnosed with pulmonary NTM disease at participating institutions between August 2009 and December 2018. Patients were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study. Taking into consideration the presence of competing risks, we used the cumulative incidence function with Gray's test and Fine-Gray regression analysis for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients (34 RA patients and 191 non-RA controls) were followed, with a mean time of 47.5 months. Death occurred in 35.3% of RA patients and 25.7% of non-RA patients. An exacerbation of pulmonary NTM disease represented the major cause of death. The estimated cumulative incidence of all-cause death at 5 years was 24% for RA patients and 23% for non-RA patients. For NTM-related death, the 5-year cumulative incidence rate was estimated to be 11% for RA patients and 18% for non-RA patients. Gray's test revealed that long-term mortality estimates were not significantly different between patient groups. Fine-Gray regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for NTM-related death were advanced age (adjusted hazards ratio 7.28 [95% confidence interval 2.91-18.20] for >=80 years and 3.68 [1.46-9.26] for 70-80 years vs. <70 years), male sex (2.40 [1.29-4.45]), Mycobacterium abscessus complex (4.30 [1.46-12.69] vs. M. avium), and cavitary disease (4.08 [1.70-9.80]). CONCLUSIONS: RA patients with pulmonary NTM disease were not at greater risk of long-term mortality compared with non-RA patients. Rather, advanced age, male sex, causative NTM species, and cavitary NTM disease should be considered when predicting the outcomes of RA patients with pulmonary NTM disease."

The environmental survey enabled the identification of NTM in 93% of cases (n=13/14), mainly Mycobacterium avium. Serum precipitins directed against NTM were found in 10% of the cases (n=2/20). Three cases received corticosteroid therapy and none received antibiotics. Antigenic eviction has improved the symptomatology in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort supports the hypothesis that HTL is predominantly a type I HP. Avoidance of the agent involved (NTM) is necessary. The diagnosis is difficult because serum precipitins against NTM are not easily demonstrable. An environmental survey could facilitate the identification of the NTM. Prevention of HTL depends on education of the clinician and the patient."

Although mycobacterial infections are generally uncommon in horses, 10 equine abortion cases caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH) infections occurred between 2018 and 2019 in Japan. They occurred on seven Thoroughbred horse farms in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, but direct contact among the mares on different farms was not recorded. Most cases were characterized by extensive pathological lesions of the placenta, which are not typical in cases of common pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Escherichia coli. All abortions featured white-yellow exudates on the surface of the placenta. Mycobacterial granuloma formations were histologically found in the placenta and fetal organs, and acid-fast bacteria were isolated from the placenta, fetal samples (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and stomach contents) or uterine lavage fluid. The greatest number of bacteria was isolated from necrotic lesions on the placenta, which could be an important site for bacterial isolation in mycobacterial equine abortions. The isolates were identified as MAH based on internal genome sequences. In variable number tandem repeat analysis, all patterns of the strains were identical. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the core genome grouped all strains in the II-a/SC3 subcluster. Both results reveal that these strains share the same genetic background, suggesting that the horses had been infected by the same unknown contagious source."

Primary, which is associated with genetic mutation and familial predisposition and secondary, which is usually associated with infections, malignancies and autoimmune conditions. More often multiple risk factors are present at the time of initial presentation. We report a case where HLH was the presenting manifestation of relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the presence of multiple risk factors of secondary HLH such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active genital herpes, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and prior chemotherapy. A 38-year-old male to female transgender woman presented with one-week history of fever, nausea, vomiting and generalized weakness. The past medical history was significant for HIV and previously treated and positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed complete remission of Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Physical examination showed BP 92/40 mmHg, fever of 102.6 F, heart rate of 114 beats per minutes, diffuse abdominal tenderness and male genitalia with multiple small ulcerative lesions. Labs showed pancytopenia, hyponatremia, mildly elevated total and direct bilirubin, transaminitis, CD-4 count 96/mcL, HIV viral load undetectable and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative. Imaging showed right middle lung lobe consolidation and hepatosplenomegaly with multiple hypodense lesions. Lymphadenopathy was reported in mediastinum and retroperitoneum. The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, vasopressors and stress dose steroids. After initial improvement, vasopressors and steroids were stopped. The patient again started spiking fever on day 9 despite being on antibiotics. Workup showed EBV viremia, genital herpes and evidence of MAC infection on sputum culture. No improvement noted despite appropriate treatment for genital herpes and MAC. Additional lab work showed hyperferritinemia and elevated soluble Interleukin-2 receptors. The patient was diagnosed with HLH as per HLH-2004 criteria and treated with dexamethasone and etoposide. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed hemophagocytosis and immunoperoxidase staining established the diagnosis of relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma. We can conclude that in patients with a history of hematological malignancy presenting with HLH, a high degree of suspicion for relapse should be maintained even in the presence of other risk factors."

The elk showed severe coughing, respiratory distress, abdominal breathing, anorexia, and severe progressive emaciation in the elk farm. At necropsy, the elk appeared in poor body condition. Mild enlargement of retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph node was observed in the head. Diffuse fibrinous pleuritis and purple red lobar pneumonia were found in the thorax. Well demarcated numerous dark yellow discrete or confluent nodules from 0.3 to 2 cm in diameter were scattered in the whole lung. Bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes were also enlarged. Histopathologically, lungs had typical classical tuberculous granulomas, multiple abscesses, and numerous macrophages and Langhans giant cells infiltration in alveolar lumen. In the lymph nodes, there were small clusters of necrosis and infiltration of numerous macrophages, epithelioid cells, and Langhans giant cells. With the acid-fast staining, numerous mycobacteria were revealed in the lung and lymph nodes. According to this study, there are differences of the histopathologic lesions and the numbers of acid-fast bacilli in the lesions between this elk and cattle. Mycobacterium bovis was confirmed as a causative agent in this elk using bacterial isolation, biochemical characteristics, and PCR technique. The isolate was negative for niacin test, nitrate reductase, and pyrazinamidase. This is a first report for bovine tuberculosis of farmed elk in Asia."

The first elephant presented with severe, acute lameness of the left rear limb. Despite extensive treatments, the animal collapsed and died 13 mo after initial presentation. Necropsy revealed osteomyelitis with loss of the femoral head and acetabulum and pulmonary granulomas with intralesional M. szulgai. The second elephant collapsed during transport to another institution with no premonitory clinical signs. This animal was euthanized because of prolonged recumbency. Granulomatous pneumonia with intralesional M. szulgai was found at necropsy. Two novel immunoassays performed on banked serum samples detected antibody responses to mycobacterial antigens in both infected elephants. It was not possible to determine when the infection was established or how the elephants were infected. When reviewing the epidemiology of this organism in humans, however, transmission between elephants seemed unlikely because human-to-human transmission of this organism has never been reported and a third elephant in the herd was not affected. In addition to Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial organisms need to be considered potentially pathogenic in elephants."

Affected individuals are most prone to infections caused by staphylococci, Salmonella, Candida, and Aspergillus, but previously we observed a high incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in Chinese children with CGD. OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of infections in patients with X-linked CGD, with an emphasis on mycobacterial infections, and to review all CYBB gene mutations identified in our center. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2005, 17 Chinese male children were diagnosed to have X-linked CGD. Fifteen mutations were identified, including 3 splice site defects (IVS1-1G&gt;C, 266G&gt;A, IVS3-1G&gt;A), 5 missense mutations (591T&gt;C, 627T&gt;A, 949T&gt;A, 1039T&gt;A, 1512G&gt;C), 3 nonsense mutations (882C&gt;T, 1451C&gt;A, 1569G&gt;T), 1 insertion (756_757insA), and 3 deletions (660_662delTTC, 727delT, 1341delT). Eight of these were novel mutations. Recurrent pneumonia, lymphadenitis, and bacterial skin abscess were the commonest types of infection. Seven patients had tuberculosis (TB). Seven patients had prolonged scarring or abscess formation at the Calmette-Guerin bacillus (BCG) injection site, and 1 had disseminated BCG infection. Three patients had pulmonary aspergillosis. Four patients underwent hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, but 2 died of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CGD are susceptible to TB and BCG complications. Our observation suggests that oxidative burst is probably important in host defense against mycobacterial infections. Because interferon-gamma is the key cytokine involved in mycobacterial immunity, there may be a stronger indication for its use in CGD patients living in areas endemic for TB."

A 60-year-old, nonsmoking homemaker was referred to our hospital with nonresolving pneumonia. The patient had dyspnea, cough, and fever that started after 3 weekly cycles of intravesical BCG. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple tiny nodules and ground-glass opacities on both lung fields. Pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive ventilatory defect with decreased diffusion capacity. Histopathology of the transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed immature noncaseating granulomata. Immunoblotting analysis of serum and BCG demonstrated more than 10 immunoglobulin G fractions binding to BCG. This case illustrates that HP can be caused by intravesical instillation of BCG."

The supply of human tissues with post primary tuberculosis plummeted with the introduction of antibiotics decades before the flowering of research using molecular methods in animal models. Unfortunately, the paucity of human tissues prevented validation of the models. As a result, it is a paradigm of contemporary research that caseating granulomas are the characteristic lesion of all tuberculosis and that cavities form when they erode into bronchi. This differs from descriptions of the preantibiotic era when many investigators had access to thousands of cases. They reported that post primary tuberculosis begins as an exudative reaction: a tuberculous lipid pneumonia of foamy alveolar macrophages that undergoes caseation necrosis and fragmentation to produce cavities. Granulomas in post primary disease arise only in response to old caseous pneumonia and produce fibrosis, not cavities. We confirmed and extended these observations with study of 104 cases of untreated tuberculosis. In addition, studies of the lungs of infants and immunosuppressed adults revealed a second type of tuberculous pneumonia that seldom produces cavities. Since the concept that cavities arise from caseating granulomas was supported by studies of animals infected with Mycobacterium bovis, we investigated its pathology. We found that M. bovis does not produce post primary tuberculosis in any species. It only produces an aggressive primary tuberculosis that can develop small cavities by erosion of caseating granulomas. Consequently, a key unresolved question in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis is identification of the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis establish a localized safe haven in alveolar macrophages in an otherwise solidly immune host where it can develop conditions for formation of cavities and transmission to new hosts."

Two severely debilitated alpaca were presented to the University Veterinary Hospital, University College Dublin in November 2004. Bloods were taken, and haematology and biochemistry results were indicative of chronic infection. Radiological examination showed evidence of diffuse granulomatous pneumonia suggestive of tuberculosis. On necropsy there were granulomatous lesions present throughout many body organs including lung, liver, kidney, intestine as well on peritoneum and mesentery. Culture of acid-fast bacilli from lesions led to a diagnosis of tuberculosis due to M. bovis. The use of intradermal skin testing proved inefficient and unreliable for ante mortem diagnosis of tuberculosis in alpaca. Infection due to M. bovis should be considered among the differential diagnoses of debilitating diseases in alpaca, particularly those farmed in areas known to be traditional black spots for tuberculosis in cattle."

An additional use of BCG is for immunotherapy of cancer in which the vaccine is administered intravesically for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. The efficacy of immunotherapy with BCG in the prevention of recurrence is estimated at 70-99%, which is higher than for local chemotherapy. The most frequent complications of such treatment include fever and urinary bladder inflammation, while serious complications of haematogenous organ inflammation, especially inflammation of the lungs with the formation of pulmonary caseosus granulomas, are rarely seen. The authors reported a case of a 68-year-old man who was treated with intravesical BCG instillations due to a superficial bladder cancer. The patient underwent transurethral resection of bladder cancer and then periodically received intravesical BCG instillations. A few days after one instillation, systemic symptoms with a high fever appeared. Further examinations showed features of hepatitis and spread pulmonary changes. The patient underwent videothoracoscopy, and a fragment of lung parenchyma was collected. The histopathological examination revealed the presence of granulomas with central caseosus necrosis. Suspecting BCG infection, diagnostics were enhanced to include bacteriological and genetic tests for the presence of acid-resistant bacilli, which finally gave negative results. The authors diagnosed granulomatous pneumonia as a complication of intravesical BCG immunotherapy. Treatment with antituberculous drugs was initiated. After completing pharmacological treatment, radiological control was performed, which showed significant but not complete remission of pulmonary changes. "

However, major side effects, including pneumonitis, sepsis, and even death, may occur in &lt;5% of patients (Gonzalez et al., 2003). Here we present a case of severe disseminated Mycobacterium bovis following intravesical BCG administration. Our patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with newly diagnosed superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who recently received his first intravesical BCG treatment. He initially presented with hemoptysis and was found to have extensive patchy infiltrates bilaterally. He was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and then with steroids for hypersensitivity pneumonitis but continued to deteriorate. Due to the temporal proximity of his exposure to BCG, we administered treatment for presumed disseminated BCG infection with rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Within a 48-hour period, the patient improved dramatically. The reported cases of infection from intravesical BCG illustrate an insidious onset with initial symptoms of low-grade fevers and cystitis but may progress to pneumonitis. If the symptoms persist for more than 7 days or if there is clinical deterioration, RIPE therapy (with rifampin, isoniazid, pyridoxine, and ethambutol) and a fluoroquinolone should be administered for a 6-9-month course along with steroids for 4-6 weeks (Naudziunas et al., 2012).

The clinical presentation, microbiological/immunological evaluation and outcome will be discussed. RESULTS: 12 cases (7 males and 5 females) of disseminated BCG infections after vaccination were documented with age ranges 3 and 32 months. Eight (66%) patients had interleukin IL-12 deficiency and 3 (25%) had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) and 1 (8%) had Interferon gamma receptor II deficiency. 9 (75%) patients presented with generalized lymphadenopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly was present in 6 (50%) patients. 2 (16%) patients presented with a recurrent skin infection and persistent oral candidiasis in one patient and pneumonia in the other. Five (41%) families were from 1st degree consanguineous marriage. Tuberculosis (TB) culture and sensitivity were positive for Mycobacterium bovis from gastric aspirate (GA) in 4 patients and the lymph node in 9 patients and 1 patient had culture positive from both skin lesion and lymph nodes. Mycobacterium bovis PCR was positive in 4 patients. All patients received anti-tuberculosis therapy; all patients survived except one who died due to multi-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the prevalence of disseminated BCG vaccine in immunocompromised Saudi children is significantly high. Since in our region we have a high consanguinity rate and a high number of primary immune deficiency disorder (PID), we believe that BCG vaccination should be postponed till a child reaches one-year-old and appropriate tests exclude the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases."

Other causes include berylliosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, Crohn's disease, silicone-induced granulomas, cat-scratch disease, Wegener's granulomatosis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Hypercalcaemia in granulomatous disease occurs as a consequence of dysregulated production of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 (calcitriol) by activated macrophages in granulomas. Hypercalcaemia in patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has been reported in 0%-28% of cases. Uncultured bronchoalveolar lavage cells from patients with M. tuberculosis produce greater amounts of calcitriol compared with controls. Although Nayar et al described hypercalcaemia in a case of sepsis associated with intravesical Bacille Calmette Guerin therapy, there are no published reports describing hypercalcaemia in patients with pulmonary M. bovis infection.

The infection entered the cattery with an imported kitten (cat A); it had a suspected bite wound on its leg that had been treated at a veterinary clinic in Kiev, Ukraine, which is probably where it became infected with M. bovis. When the kitten arrived in Italy, there were four cats in the cattery; an adult female, her two kittens and a kitten imported from Russia. These were all healthy, and had no outdoor access. All five cats developed tuberculous interstitial pneumonia; in cat A this occurred 6 weeks after importation, the others were diagnosed 4-6 weeks later. Three cats were euthanised with deteriorating pneumonia while two cats remained clinically well on antibiotic therapy (marbofloxacin, doxycycline and azithromycin). The latter cases were euthanised after 5 weeks, as required by Italian law once M. bovis infection was suspected. Changes consistent with tuberculosis on gross post-mortem examination included mesenteric and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, and the presence of disseminated focal white lesions on the cut surface of the spleen, liver and lungs.

Infection with M. bovis genotype 10:a was confirmed by culture and DNA typing of isolates in a small number of cases (n=5); PCR was used in combination with or as an alternative to culture (n=12) and/or infection with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group organism was strongly suggested by positive responses to an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA; n=34). Asymptomatic at-risk cats were screened by IGRA, identifying a further 83 infected cats. The five culture-positive cases were distributed across areas of England and Scotland at low risk of endemic bovine tuberculosis. Investigations revealed affected cats were mainly indoor-only, and had been fed the same commercial raw food as at least part of their diet. This diet was recalled by the manufacturer due to failure of statutory meat inspection of the component venison. As far as possible, other sources of infection were explored and excluded; including wildlife contact, access to raw milk and living with people with active M. bovis infection. Four owners and one veterinary surgeon were found to have high likelihood of latent tuberculosis infection. One owner required treatment. Although it was not possible to conclusively demonstrate a zoonotic origin for these infections, neither was it possible to eliminate the possibility. Our results provide compelling evidence that the commercial raw diet of these cats was the likely route of M. bovis infection in this outbreak of cases."

Post-mortem findings revealed multi-focal widespread nodules in all lobes of the lungs with markedly enlarged lymph nodes. Isolate from cultured sample was subjected to spoligotyping which confirmed the isolate as Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) belonging to the SB1027 clade with octal number 676773776277600 (Figure 1). This finding has implications on the health of the cattle handlers considering aerosol inhalation of disseminated bacilli from the lungs of the infected bull through cough sprays. Routine screening of cattle for tuberculosis is therefore emphasized.

However, there is limited information on molecular characteristics and drug-resistant patterns of MTB in patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and drug resistance patterns of MTB in patients with EPTB in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was conducted on frozen stored isolates of EPTB survey conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A drug susceptibility test was performed using BACTEC-MGIT 960. Species and strain identification were performed using the Geno-Type MTBC and spoligotyping technique, respectively. Data were entered into the MIRU-VNTRplus database to assess the spoligotype patterns of MTB. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 23, and participants' characteristics were presented by numbers and proportions. RESULTS: Of 151 MTB isolates, 29 (19.2%) were resistant to at least one drug. The highest proportion of isolates was resistant to Isoniazid (14.6%) and Pyrazinamide (14.6%). Nine percent of isolates had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and 21.4% of them had pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB). Among the 151 MTB isolates characterized by spoligotyping, 142 (94.6%) had known patterns, while 9 (6.0%) isolates were not matched with the MIRU-VNTRplus spoligotype database. Of the isolates which had known patterns, 2% was M.bovis while 98% M. tuberculosis. Forty-one different spoligotype patterns were identified. The most frequently identified SpolDB4 (SIT) wereSIT149 (21.2%), SIT53 (14.6%) and SIT26 (9.6%). The predominant genotypes identified were T (53.6%), Central Asia Strain (19.2%) and Haarlem (9.9%). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a high proportion of MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB among EPTB patients. The strains were mostly grouped into SIT149, SIT53, and SIT26. The T family lineage was the most prevalent genotype. MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB prevention is required to combat these strains in EPTB. A large scale study is required to describe the molecular characteristics and drug resistance patterns of MTB isolates in EPTB patients."

She was suffering from axillary lymphadenitis ipsilateral to the BCG vaccination site, failure to thrive, unresolving fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Acid-fast bacilli were seen on staining and Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the regional lymph node. The infant responded promptly to triple antituberculous therapy but died 2 months later from overwhelming pneumonia and respiratory failure. This case emphasizes the iatrogenic hazards of BCG immunization in HIV-1 infected infants. With the increasing prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection, indiscriminate BCG immunization programs should be reconsidered. While infants with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection at risk for tuberculosis should be immunized, BCG immunization should be withheld in those with symptomatic disease."

The elk showed severe coughing, respiratory distress, abdominal breathing, anorexia, and severe progressive emaciation in the elk farm. At necropsy, the elk appeared in poor body condition. Mild enlargement of retropharyngeal and submandibular lymph node was observed in the head. Diffuse fibrinous pleuritis and purple red lobar pneumonia were found in the thorax. Well demarcated numerous dark yellow discrete or confluent nodules from 0.3 to 2 cm in diameter were scattered in the whole lung. Bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes were also enlarged. Histopathologically, lungs had typical classical tuberculous granulomas, multiple abscesses, and numerous macrophages and Langhans giant cells infiltration in alveolar lumen. In the lymph nodes, there were small clusters of necrosis and infiltration of numerous macrophages, epithelioid cells, and Langhans giant cells. With the acid-fast staining, numerous mycobacteria were revealed in the lung and lymph nodes. According to this study, there are differences of the histopathologic lesions and the numbers of acid-fast bacilli in the lesions between this elk and cattle. Mycobacterium bovis was confirmed as a causative agent in this elk using bacterial isolation, biochemical characteristics, and PCR technique. The isolate was negative for niacin test, nitrate reductase, and pyrazinamidase. This is a first report for bovine tuberculosis of farmed elk in Asia."

The first elephant presented with severe, acute lameness of the left rear limb. Despite extensive treatments, the animal collapsed and died 13 mo after initial presentation. Necropsy revealed osteomyelitis with loss of the femoral head and acetabulum and pulmonary granulomas with intralesional M. szulgai. The second elephant collapsed during transport to another institution with no premonitory clinical signs. This animal was euthanized because of prolonged recumbency. Granulomatous pneumonia with intralesional M. szulgai was found at necropsy. Two novel immunoassays performed on banked serum samples detected antibody responses to mycobacterial antigens in both infected elephants. It was not possible to determine when the infection was established or how the elephants were infected. When reviewing the epidemiology of this organism in humans, however, transmission between elephants seemed unlikely because human-to-human transmission of this organism has never been reported and a third elephant in the herd was not affected. In addition to Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial organisms need to be considered potentially pathogenic in elephants."

It is unacceptable to treat human subjects intranasally with live BCG. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether BCG killed by extended freeze-drying (EFD) and subcutaneously injected has a protective effect in murine and guinea pig models of allergic airway inflammation. METHODS: Mice were OVA sensitized (days 0 and 7), treated subcutaneously (day 14) with EFD and live or heat-killed BCG, and then OVA challenged (day 42). OVA-sensitized mice (days 0 and 7) were challenged (day 14) and EFD treated (day 18) before OVA rechallenge (day 46) to demonstrate the capacity of EFD to reverse the established lung inflammation. Guinea pigs were OVA sensitized (days 0 and 14), treated intradermally (day 35) with EFD, and OVA challenged (days 90-105). RESULTS: In mice and guinea pigs EFD treatment reduced AHR. Among 3 BCG preparations, only EFD efficiently reduced AHR, eosinophilia, and the recruitment of dendritic cells to the lungs after OVA challenge. The protective effect of EFD is associated with production of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10. Moreover, EFD treatment did not induce toxic effects or delayed-type hypersensitivity to mycobacterial antigens; that is, it did not interfere with the diagnosis of tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: EFD administered subcutaneously inhibits the development of allergic airway inflammation and prevents AHR without inducing delayed-type hypersensitivity and side effects associated with live or heat-killed BCG."

Affected individuals are most prone to infections caused by staphylococci, Salmonella, Candida, and Aspergillus, but previously we observed a high incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in Chinese children with CGD. OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of infections in patients with X-linked CGD, with an emphasis on mycobacterial infections, and to review all CYBB gene mutations identified in our center. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2005, 17 Chinese male children were diagnosed to have X-linked CGD. Fifteen mutations were identified, including 3 splice site defects (IVS1-1G&gt;C, 266G&gt;A, IVS3-1G&gt;A), 5 missense mutations (591T&gt;C, 627T&gt;A, 949T&gt;A, 1039T&gt;A, 1512G&gt;C), 3 nonsense mutations (882C&gt;T, 1451C&gt;A, 1569G&gt;T), 1 insertion (756_757insA), and 3 deletions (660_662delTTC, 727delT, 1341delT). Eight of these were novel mutations. Recurrent pneumonia, lymphadenitis, and bacterial skin abscess were the commonest types of infection. Seven patients had tuberculosis (TB). Seven patients had prolonged scarring or abscess formation at the Calmette-Guerin bacillus (BCG) injection site, and 1 had disseminated BCG infection. Three patients had pulmonary aspergillosis. Four patients underwent hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, but 2 died of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CGD are susceptible to TB and BCG complications. Our observation suggests that oxidative burst is probably important in host defense against mycobacterial infections. Because interferon-gamma is the key cytokine involved in mycobacterial immunity, there may be a stronger indication for its use in CGD patients living in areas endemic for TB."

High-resolution computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple tiny nodules and ground-glass opacities on both lung fields. Pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive ventilatory defect with decreased diffusion capacity. Histopathology of the transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed immature noncaseating granulomata. Immunoblotting analysis of serum and BCG demonstrated more than 10 immunoglobulin G fractions binding to BCG. This case illustrates that HP can be caused by intravesical instillation of BCG."

Two severely debilitated alpaca were presented to the University Veterinary Hospital, University College Dublin in November 2004. Bloods were taken, and haematology and biochemistry results were indicative of chronic infection. Radiological examination showed evidence of diffuse granulomatous pneumonia suggestive of tuberculosis. On necropsy there were granulomatous lesions present throughout many body organs including lung, liver, kidney, intestine as well on peritoneum and mesentery. Culture of acid-fast bacilli from lesions led to a diagnosis of tuberculosis due to M. bovis. The use of intradermal skin testing proved inefficient and unreliable for ante mortem diagnosis of tuberculosis in alpaca. Infection due to M. bovis should be considered among the differential diagnoses of debilitating diseases in alpaca, particularly those farmed in areas known to be traditional black spots for tuberculosis in cattle."

An additional use of BCG is for immunotherapy of cancer in which the vaccine is administered intravesically for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. The efficacy of immunotherapy with BCG in the prevention of recurrence is estimated at 70-99%, which is higher than for local chemotherapy. The most frequent complications of such treatment include fever and urinary bladder inflammation, while serious complications of haematogenous organ inflammation, especially inflammation of the lungs with the formation of pulmonary caseosus granulomas, are rarely seen. The authors reported a case of a 68-year-old man who was treated with intravesical BCG instillations due to a superficial bladder cancer. The patient underwent transurethral resection of bladder cancer and then periodically received intravesical BCG instillations. A few days after one instillation, systemic symptoms with a high fever appeared. Further examinations showed features of hepatitis and spread pulmonary changes. The patient underwent videothoracoscopy, and a fragment of lung parenchyma was collected. The histopathological examination revealed the presence of granulomas with central caseosus necrosis. Suspecting BCG infection, diagnostics were enhanced to include bacteriological and genetic tests for the presence of acid-resistant bacilli, which finally gave negative results. The authors diagnosed granulomatous pneumonia as a complication of intravesical BCG immunotherapy. Treatment with antituberculous drugs was initiated. After completing pharmacological treatment, radiological control was performed, which showed significant but not complete remission of pulmonary changes. "

However, major side effects, including pneumonitis, sepsis, and even death, may occur in &lt;5% of patients (Gonzalez et al., 2003). Here we present a case of severe disseminated Mycobacterium bovis following intravesical BCG administration. Our patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with newly diagnosed superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who recently received his first intravesical BCG treatment. He initially presented with hemoptysis and was found to have extensive patchy infiltrates bilaterally. He was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics and then with steroids for hypersensitivity pneumonitis but continued to deteriorate. Due to the temporal proximity of his exposure to BCG, we administered treatment for presumed disseminated BCG infection with rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Within a 48-hour period, the patient improved dramatically. The reported cases of infection from intravesical BCG illustrate an insidious onset with initial symptoms of low-grade fevers and cystitis but may progress to pneumonitis. If the symptoms persist for more than 7 days or if there is clinical deterioration, RIPE therapy (with rifampin, isoniazid, pyridoxine, and ethambutol) and a fluoroquinolone should be administered for a 6-9-month course along with steroids for 4-6 weeks (Naudziunas et al., 2012).

Disseminated BCG infection (""BCG-osis"") after this therapy is rare and potentially life-threatening; only isolated case reports detail the histopathologic findings thereof, few of which had a diagnosis confirmed by molecular testing. We report 3 additional cases of BCG-osis complicating BCG therapy, all confirmed by cultures and molecular assays, including the first cases of wedge biopsy-confirmed BCG pneumonia and BCG olecranon bursitis. When suggested by a relevant clinical history, recognition of randomly distributed granulomas in any organ should prompt consideration of BCG-osis and liberal performance of AFB stains, aided by targeted molecular assays. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when miliary infiltrates arise after intravesical BCG instillation, and close multidisciplinary communication is essential. Pathologist awareness of this rare cause of granulomatous inflammation aids recognition of BCG-osis and facilitates prompt initiation of antimycobacterial therapy. "

Although, Post BCG vaccination complications like disseminated BCG infections are rare and immunocompromised children are at high risk of developing BCG-related complications including BCG-lymphadenitis and other disseminated diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of children who developed disseminated BCG after vaccination who were admitted in three tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the year 2015. The clinical presentation, microbiological/immunological evaluation and outcome will be discussed. RESULTS: 12 cases (7 males and 5 females) of disseminated BCG infections after vaccination were documented with age ranges 3 and 32 months. Eight (66%) patients had interleukin IL-12 deficiency and 3 (25%) had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) and 1 (8%) had Interferon gamma receptor II deficiency. 9 (75%) patients presented with generalized lymphadenopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly was present in 6 (50%) patients. 2 (16%) patients presented with a recurrent skin infection and persistent oral candidiasis in one patient and pneumonia in the other. Five (41%) families were from 1st degree consanguineous marriage. Tuberculosis (TB) culture and sensitivity were positive for Mycobacterium bovis from gastric aspirate (GA) in 4 patients and the lymph node in 9 patients and 1 patient had culture positive from both skin lesion and lymph nodes. Mycobacterium bovis PCR was positive in 4 patients. All patients received anti-tuberculosis therapy; all patients survived except one who died due to multi-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the prevalence of disseminated BCG vaccine in immunocompromised Saudi children is significantly high. Since in our region we have a high consanguinity rate and a high number of primary immune deficiency disorder (PID), we believe that BCG vaccination should be postponed till a child reaches one-year-old and appropriate tests exclude the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases."

Among them, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are the most common causes. Other causes include berylliosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, Crohn's disease, silicone-induced granulomas, cat-scratch disease, Wegener's granulomatosis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Hypercalcaemia in granulomatous disease occurs as a consequence of dysregulated production of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 (calcitriol) by activated macrophages in granulomas. Hypercalcaemia in patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has been reported in 0%-28% of cases. Uncultured bronchoalveolar lavage cells from patients with M. tuberculosis produce greater amounts of calcitriol compared with controls. Although Nayar et al described hypercalcaemia in a case of sepsis associated with intravesical Bacille Calmette Guerin therapy, there are no published reports describing hypercalcaemia in patients with pulmonary M. bovis infection. We describe a patient with M. bovis cavitary pulmonary infection with sustained hypercalcaemia that fluctuated and recurred repeatedly over the course of therapy, ultimately culminating in normalisation of serum calcium when therapy had led to cure.

The infection entered the cattery with an imported kitten (cat A); it had a suspected bite wound on its leg that had been treated at a veterinary clinic in Kiev, Ukraine, which is probably where it became infected with M. bovis. When the kitten arrived in Italy, there were four cats in the cattery; an adult female, her two kittens and a kitten imported from Russia. These were all healthy, and had no outdoor access. All five cats developed tuberculous interstitial pneumonia; in cat A this occurred 6 weeks after importation, the others were diagnosed 4-6 weeks later. Three cats were euthanised with deteriorating pneumonia while two cats remained clinically well on antibiotic therapy (marbofloxacin, doxycycline and azithromycin). The latter cases were euthanised after 5 weeks, as required by Italian law once M. bovis infection was suspected. Changes consistent with tuberculosis on gross post-mortem examination included mesenteric and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, and the presence of disseminated focal white lesions on the cut surface of the spleen, liver and lungs. Visible acid-fast bacteria (cats A, B and C) were confirmed as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by PCR (cats A, B, C, D and E), refined to M. bovis (cats A, B and D), spoligotype SB0950 (cats A and D)."

Here, we investigated a cohort of 40 genetically diagnosed CD40L-deficient patients from the Chinese mainland, analysed their clinical and genetic data, and examined CD40L expression, the proportion of T cell subsets, B cell subsets and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. The aim was to provide a complete picture of CD40L deficiency. Initial presentations of the patient cohort mainly involved recurrent fever (47.5%) and sinopulmonary infection (42.5%). Life-threatening infections (42.5%), caused by various pathogens, were the most serious threats faced by CD40L-deficient patients, while neutropenia (57.5%) remained the most common complication. Opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and invasive fungal disease associated with Talaromyces marneffei, were also common in the cohort. In addition, seven patients (17.5%) suffered BCGitis/BCGosis, which is a major problem facing a planned immunization programme in China. It was intriguing that reduced IgM levels were observed in 12.5% of patients, while normal or elevated IgA levels were shown in 47.5% of patients. Thirty-seven unique mutations were identified in 40 patients; of these, 10 were novel. Furthermore, we observed a lower percentage of NK cells, Tfh cells, and central memory CD4+ T cells, and an extremely small class-switched memory B cell population, in CD40L-deficient patients. Patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation experienced better disease remission. Taken together, our data establish the largest database about CD40L deficiency in China and provide genetic, immunologic and clinical information about Chinese CD40L-deficient patients."

We describe an outbreak of M. bovis in pet cats across England and Scotland associated with feeding a commercial raw food diet. Forty-seven cats presented with (pyo)granulomatous lesions, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary and/or alimentary disease over a one year period where M. bovis infection was suspected or definitively diagnosed, and the cats' all consumed the same specific brand of commercial raw venison pet food. Infection with M. bovis genotype 10:a was confirmed by culture and DNA typing of isolates in a small number of cases (n=5); PCR was used in combination with or as an alternative to culture (n=12) and/or infection with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group organism was strongly suggested by positive responses to an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA; n=34). Asymptomatic at-risk cats were screened by IGRA, identifying a further 83 infected cats. The five culture-positive cases were distributed across areas of England and Scotland at low risk of endemic bovine tuberculosis. Investigations revealed affected cats were mainly indoor-only, and had been fed the same commercial raw food as at least part of their diet. This diet was recalled by the manufacturer due to failure of statutory meat inspection of the component venison. As far as possible, other sources of infection were explored and excluded; including wildlife contact, access to raw milk and living with people with active M. bovis infection. Four owners and one veterinary surgeon were found to have high likelihood of latent tuberculosis infection. One owner required treatment. Although it was not possible to conclusively demonstrate a zoonotic origin for these infections, neither was it possible to eliminate the possibility. Our results provide compelling evidence that the commercial raw diet of these cats was the likely route of M. bovis infection in this outbreak of cases."

However, there is limited information on molecular characteristics and drug-resistant patterns of MTB in patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and drug resistance patterns of MTB in patients with EPTB in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was conducted on frozen stored isolates of EPTB survey conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A drug susceptibility test was performed using BACTEC-MGIT 960. Species and strain identification were performed using the Geno-Type MTBC and spoligotyping technique, respectively. Data were entered into the MIRU-VNTRplus database to assess the spoligotype patterns of MTB. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 23, and participants' characteristics were presented by numbers and proportions. RESULTS: Of 151 MTB isolates, 29 (19.2%) were resistant to at least one drug. The highest proportion of isolates was resistant to Isoniazid (14.6%) and Pyrazinamide (14.6%). Nine percent of isolates had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and 21.4% of them had pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB). Among the 151 MTB isolates characterized by spoligotyping, 142 (94.6%) had known patterns, while 9 (6.0%) isolates were not matched with the MIRU-VNTRplus spoligotype database. Of the isolates which had known patterns, 2% was M.bovis while 98% M. tuberculosis. Forty-one different spoligotype patterns were identified. The most frequently identified SpolDB4 (SIT) wereSIT149 (21.2%), SIT53 (14.6%) and SIT26 (9.6%). The predominant genotypes identified were T (53.6%), Central Asia Strain (19.2%) and Haarlem (9.9%). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a high proportion of MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB among EPTB patients. The strains were mostly grouped into SIT149, SIT53, and SIT26. The T family lineage was the most prevalent genotype. MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB prevention is required to combat these strains in EPTB. A large scale study is required to describe the molecular characteristics and drug resistance patterns of MTB isolates in EPTB patients."

She was suffering from axillary lymphadenitis ipsilateral to the BCG vaccination site, failure to thrive, unresolving fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Acid-fast bacilli were seen on staining and Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the regional lymph node. The infant responded promptly to triple antituberculous therapy but died 2 months later from overwhelming pneumonia and respiratory failure. This case emphasizes the iatrogenic hazards of BCG immunization in HIV-1 infected infants. With the increasing prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection, indiscriminate BCG immunization programs should be reconsidered. While infants with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection at risk for tuberculosis should be immunized, BCG immunization should be withheld in those with symptomatic disease."

It is well known that Mycobacterium bovis and other species in the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) can cause respiratory diseases as zoonosis. We analyzed the MTC isolates collected from tuberculosis patients from Japan in 2002 using a multiplex PCR system that detected cfp32, RD9 and RD12. A total of 970 MTC isolates that were representative of the tuberculosis cases throughout Japan, were examined using this method. As a result, 966 (99.6%) M. tuberculosis, two Mycobacterium africanum and two Mycobacterium canettii were identified using a multiplex PCR system, while no M. bovis was detected. Two isolates that lacked RD9 were initially considered to be M. canettii, but further analysis of the hsp65 sequence revealed them to be M. tuberculosis. Also two M. africanum were identified as M. tuberculosis using the -215 narG nucleotide polymorphism. Though PCR-linked methods have been used for a rapid differentiation of MTC and NTM, from our cases we suggest careful interpretation of RD based identification. "

M. canettii infections are mainly described in the Horn of Africa. The permanent presence of French soldiers in Djibouti raises the question of the risk of being infected with M. canettii. Our study aims to describe M. canettii infections among French military or their families between 1998 and 2015. Methods: This retrospective study relied on 3 sources of data: the reference centre for mycobacteria in the Biology Department at Percy military hospital in Paris, the French Military Center for Epidemiology and Public Health, and the scientific literature. After an exhaustive census of the strains, we studied the epidemiological data on 20 cases among French soldiers and their families. Results: 20 cases of M. canettii infections are reported, including 5 unpublished cases. Adenitis predominates (n = 15), especially in the cervico facial area and among children; one case was observed one month after dental care in Djibouti. The pulmonary forms were less frequent (n = 6) and 3 atypical forms are described. All patients had stayed in Djibouti. Conclusions: Cases of M. canettii infection among the French military consisted mainly of adenitis; disseminated forms were possible with immunodeficiency. Their evolution under specific treatments were comparable to tuberculosis. The presumed origin of the infection seemed to be environmental, possibly a water reservoir, and not due to human-to-human contagion."

Its main causative agents, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae, have been isolated from many different domestic and wild animals. Naturally occurring tuberculosis is extremely rare in rabbits and implication of M. caprae has never been reported earlier. This study describes a severe tuberculosis outbreak caused by M. caprae in a Spanish farm of rabbits raised for meat for human consumption. The disease was first identified in a cachectic dam and then it was confirmed in ten does with similar clinical signs. Subsequently, a depopulation operation was ordered for public health, animal welfare and environmental reasons. To broaden knowledge of spontaneous tuberculosis in rabbits, a study focused on pathological, epidemiological and diagnostic aspects was carried out on 51 does and 16 kittens after receiving the necessary authorizations. These animals were subjected to a modified intradermal test. After being euthanized, rabbits were examined for the presence of visible tuberculosis-compatible lesions. Lung, kidney, cecal appendix and sacculus rotundus samples underwent microbiological and anatomopathological analysis. Infection was revealed by at least one of the methods used in 71% of dams and in 44% of kittens. The intradermal test was shown to be a good indicator of infection. Lung was the tissue for which more animals were positive but renal and intestinal tissues were also affected in many cases. Apparently, M. caprae spread mainly through the aerogenous route. Infection was pathologically characterized by the absence of evident fibrous capsules surrounding granulomas. A spoligotype (SB0415) frequently found in this area was considered responsible for the outbreak but the source could not be established. Regardless of the exceptional nature of animal tuberculosis in this host, rabbit industry might not escape from its effects and therefore, current biosafety and surveillance strategies should also consider this disease."

A 33-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a 3-month history of a productive cough. Her medical history included pulmonary tuberculosis 14 years earlier. Her chest X-ray revealed a large cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe. The sputum smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli, and M. celatum was subsequently identified in more than three sputum cultures, using molecular methods. After 1 year of therapy with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and ciprofloxacin, the patient underwent a pulmonary resection for a persistent cavitary lesion. The patient was considered cured after receiving 12 months of postoperative antimycobacterial chemotherapy. There has been no recurrence of disease for 18 months after treatment completion.

Certain strains have been shown to cross-react with the probes used to detect M. tuberculosis, making this a diagnostic challenge. We present a 56-year-old gentleman who developed signs and symptoms of lung infection with computed tomography scan of the chest showing right lung apex cavitation. Serial sputum samples were positive for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid amplification testing identified M. tuberculosis ribosomal RNA, resulting in treatment initiation. Further testing with high performance liquid chromatography showed a pattern consistent with M. celatum. This case illustrates the potential for M. celatum to mimic M. tuberculosis in both its clinical history and laboratory testing due to the identical oligonucleotide sequence contained in both. An increasing number of case reports suggest that early reliable differentiation could reduce unnecessary treatment and public health intervention associated with misdiagnosed tuberculosis."

Mycobacterium celatum mimicking Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A case of mistaken identity.ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium celatum is a slow-growing, non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) and a rare cause of infection in humans. Infection occurs primarily by inhalation or direct inoculation from environmental sources, and this pathogen has been reported to cause localized infections in the lungs and lymph nodes of both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, and disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. Here, we present a case of pulmonary infection with M. celatum in an immunocompetent 68-year-old male with clinical features similar to tuberculosis. The patient initially developed palpitations, worsening fatigue, night sweats, dyspnea, productive cough, and weight loss. Computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed a right upper lobe pulmonary artery embolus and extensive biapical fibronodular cavitary densities. Two separate sputum samples were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and sputum cultures were positive for M. celatum. The patient responded well to treatment with clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ethambutol. We advise physicians to consider M. celatum infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with symptoms and radiographic and microbiologic evidence suggestive of NTM pulmonary infection."

While T-SPOT Test and PCR analyses proved negative for tuberculosis, microscopic sputum evaluation showed acid-fast bacilli and Mycobacterium celatum was found in culture. Uniquely, in our case M. celatum was resistant to rifabutin. Therefore, after not responding to combination treatment including rifabutin, our patient was treated with ethambutol, clarithromycin and protionamide. Classical risk factors for atypical mycobacteriosis such as immunodeficiency (including medication-induced), preexisting pulmonary disease or multimorbidity were not present. We conclude that the high age of the patient (92 y) may have been the main contributing factor for the infection."

METHODS: Whole genome shotgun sequencing and comparative microbial genomic analyses were used to characterize the isolate from a patient diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) after relapse. RESULTS: The genome sequence of the first case of M. yongonense (M. yongonense RT 955-2015) in Tanzania is presented. Sequence analysis revealed that the RT 955-2015 strain had a high similarity to M. yongonense 05-1390(T) (98.74%) and Mycobacterium chimaera DSM 44623(T) (98%).

RECENT FINDINGS: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous but are an uncommon cause of disease after solid organ transplantation. The incidence of infection is higher in thoracic transplant recipients than in abdominal transplant recipients, with most cases seen after lung transplantation. It is associated with increased morbidity and, occasionally, mortality. Infection in the pre-transplant setting can occur in lung transplant candidates, often posing a dilemma regarding transplant listing. Disease manifestations are diverse, and pulmonary disease is the most common. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Treatment requires a multiple-drug combination and is limited by drug-drug interactions and tolerability. Mycobacterium abscessus is a challenge in lung transplant recipients, due to its intrinsic resistance and propensity to relapse even after prolonged therapy. Mycobacterium chimaera is an emerging pathogen associated with contamination of heater-cooler units and is described to cause disease months after cardiothoracic surgery. NTM infections in thoracic organ transplant recipients are uncommon but are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Data from larger multicenter studies is needed to better define the epidemiology of NTM in thoracic transplantation, best treatment options, and the management of infected transplant candidates."

However, the spectrum of clinical disease remains poorly understood. To address this, we report the clinical and laboratory features, treatment and outcome of the first 30 UK cases. METHODS: Case note review was performed for cases identified retrospectively through outbreak investigations and prospectively through ongoing surveillance. Case definition was Mycobacterium chimaera detected in any clinical specimen, history of cardiothoracic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and compatible clinical presentation. RESULTS: Thirty patients were identified (28 with prosthetic material) exhibiting a spectrum of disease including prosthetic valve endocarditis (14/30), sternal wound infection (2/30), aortic graft infection (4/30) and disseminated (non-cardiac) disease (10/30). Patients presented a median of 14 months post surgery (maximum 5 years) most commonly complaining of fever and weight loss. Investigations frequently revealed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver cholestasis and non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Diagnostic sensitivity for a single mycobacterial blood culture was 68% but increased if multiple samples were sent. In all, 27 patients started macrolide-based combination treatment and 14 had further surgery. To date, 18 patients have died (60%) a median of 30 months (interquartile range 20-39 months) after initial surgery. Survival analysis identified younger age, mitral valve surgery, mechanical valve replacement, higher serum sodium concentration and lower C-reactive protein as factors associated with better survival. CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium chimaera infection following cardiac surgery is associated with a wide spectrum of disease. The diagnosis should be considered in all patients who develop an unexplained illness following cardiac surgery."

We described microbiological monitoring and the extent of microbiological contamination of HCUs utilized in our centre and strategies employed to reduce the high microbial load. METHODS: Since August 2016, we have been following the new Instructions for Use from the manufacturer for the cleaning and disinfection of three units of Stockert 3T and four units of Stockert 1T HCU at the National Heart Centre Singapore. Microbiological monitoring began in January 2017 and included acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, total colony and total coliform count. Methods, such as increasing disinfection frequency and making the HCU inactive by keeping it empty in storage, were used to reduce the high colony count. RESULTS: All three units of Stockert 3T and two units of Stockert 1T were contaminated with Mycobacterium chimaera. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and total coliform count were consistently &lt;1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 mL in every water sample of each HCU. High colony counts were encountered initially in all units. Step-up frequency of disinfection was found to be not as effective as keeping the HCU inactive in bringing the total colony count to an acceptable level. CONCLUSIONS: All monitoring and maintenance measures of HCUs need to be established and maintained to mitigate potential infection risks to patients. Strict adherence to all cleaning and disinfection processes and keeping the HCU inactive maintained the water quality of the HCU at acceptable levels."

Some of the species are resistant to various antibiotics; hence, limited treatment options are available. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of NTM and to determine the effect of d-cycloserine against Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium abscessus isolated from clinical specimens to find out the synergistic effect of d-cycloserine and clarithromycin. Methods: A total of 95 nonduplicate pulmonary isolates of NTM were collected from three major Regional Tuberculosis (TB) Centers. NTM isolates were identified by conventional tests and PCR sequence analysis of the rpoB gene. PCR sequencing of erm-41 was performed for detecting the inducible resistance to macrolides. In vitro susceptibilities and activities of d-cycloserine-clarithromycin combinations were accessed using the broth microdilution method. Results: Among 714-positive acid-fast bacilli from TB-suspected cases, 95 isolates were identified as NTM (13.3%). The prevalence of identified isolates was as follows: M. fortuitum 46 (48.4%), Mycobacterium simiae 16 (16.8%), Mycobacterium kansasii 15 (15.7%), M. abscessus 7 (7.3%), Mycobacterium thermoresistibile 4 (4.2%), Mycobacterium elephantis 3 (3.2%), Mycobacterium porcinum 2 (2.1%), and Mycobacterium chimaera 2 (2.1%). In addition, rpoB sequence analysis could identify all NTM isolates. The effect of d-cycloserine was better than that of clarithromycin. The synergistic effect of d-cycloserine with clarithromycin was observed for six (100%) and five (71.5%) strains of M. fortuitum and M. abscessus, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, we demonstrated a wide range of NTM in processed samples from different provinces of Iran. Our observations indicated that d-cycloserine was very active against M. abscessus and M. fortuitum; hence, d-cycloserine, either alone or in combination with clarithromycin, may be promising for the treatment of M. abscessus- and M. fortuitum-associated diseases."

It has been identified globally as the cause of a large outbreak of cardiovascular infections following open heart surgery, but it can also cause respiratory infections in individuals with underlying structural pulmonary disease. Invasive M. chimaera infections are associated with poor clinical responses, and the optimal antibiotic treatment regimen for these infections is not known. In this study, the drug susceptibility profiles of clinical and environmental M. chimaera isolates for antimicrobial agents that are commonly considered for treatment of MAC infections were determined. All M. chimaera isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin, with a median MIC of 2 mug/ml, while 98% (85/87 isolates) were susceptible to amikacin. Twenty-five percent of isolates (22/87 isolates) had intermediate susceptibility and 52% (46/87 isolates) were resistant to moxifloxacin. Similarly, 39% of isolates (34/87 isolates) had intermediate susceptibility and 39% (34/87 isolates) were resistant to linezolid. MIC breakpoints derived from the literature were used to determine resistance to rifampin (16/87 isolates [18%]), ethambutol (10/87 isolates [11%]), rifabutin (2/87 isolates [2%]), and streptomycin (1/87 isolates [1%]). In conclusion, our results showed that clarithromycin, amikacin, rifabutin, and streptomycin had the best activity against M. chimaera isolates, while susceptibility rates were lower for rifampin and ethambutol. In contrast, there was a high prevalence of isolates that were not susceptible to moxifloxacin or linezolid. While factors in addition to antibiotic susceptibility may determine the outcomes of treatment of M. chimaera infections, our results should inform the selection of antimicrobials as part of the overall therapeutic strategy."

During the last decade Mycobacterium chimaera disseminated infections following cardiothoracic surgery, especially open-heart surgery, have been increasingly reported worldwide. From a pathogenic standpoint, Mycobacterium chimaera is acquired during cardiopulmonary bypass via bioaerosols emitted from contaminated heater-cooler units water systems. Due to non-specific symptoms and long latency, postoperative Mycobacterium chimaera infections may not be promptly diagnosed and treated, and may become life-threatening. The indication for revision surgery needs to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and antibiotic therapy should be based on drug susceptibility testing results.

M. chimaera isolates were identified based on the findings of sequencing of rpoB gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the 16S-23S rRNA gene, and the heat-shock protein 65 gene (hsp65). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined. RESULTS: During the study period, 247 patients with MAC lung disease were identified, and 11.3% (28/247) of the patients had lung disease caused by M. chimaera. Among these patients, 17 (60.7%) were female, and their median age was 72.5 (40-100) years. All M. chimaera isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin and rifabutin. All the isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin and only 10 (35.7%) and 2 (7.1%) were susceptible to amikacin and linezolid, respectively. Of the nine patients who received macrolide-based regimens, more achieved radiographic resolution than those treated with non-macrolide-based regimens (66.7% vs 15.8%, P=0.013), and they tended to have better survival (P=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial portion (11.3%) of MAC lung disease cases were caused by M. chimaera, and treatment with macrolide-based regimens resulted in better clinical outcomes for patients with M. chimaera lung disease."

Recent studies have detailed Mycobacterium chimaera infections acquired during cardiac surgery; however, little is known about the epidemiology and clinical courses of cardiac surgery patients with invasive MABC infection. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data on all patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our hospital and subsequently had positive cultures for MABC from 2013-2016. Patients with ventricular assist devices or heart transplants were excluded. We analyzed patient characteristics, antimicrobial therapy, surgical interventions, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Ten cardiac surgery patients developed invasive, extrapulmonary infection from M. abscessus subsp. abscessus in an outbreak setting. Median time from presumed inoculation in the operating room to first positive culture was 53 days (interquartile range [IQR], 38-139 days). Disseminated infection was common, and most frequent culture-positive sites were mediastinum (n=7) and blood (n=7). PATIENTS: received a median of 24 weeks (IQR, 5-33 weeks) of combination antimicrobial therapy that included multiple intravenous agents. Six patients required antibiotic changes due to adverse events attributed to amikacin, linezolid, or tigecycline. Eight patients underwent surgical management, and six patients required multiple sternal debridements. Eight patients died within 2 years of diagnosis, including 4 deaths directly attributable to MABC infection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite aggressive medical and surgical management, invasive MABC infection after cardiac surgery caused substantial morbidity and mortality. New treatment strategies are needed, and compliance with infection prevention guidelines remains critical."

We describe a case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis caused by M. chimaera in a patient with prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. A 63-year-old female with a mechanical aortic valve replacement developed fatigue, 20 lbs. weight loss, anemia, and an elevated creatinine. Fat pad aspirate at an outside hospital was suspicious for amyloidosis which prompted hematology referral at our institution. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a single granuloma, negative for amyloid or acid fast bacillus (AFB). She was admitted to our hospital for worsening kidney function refractory to intravenous fluid challenge. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed aortic root abscess and valve vegetation with negative blood cultures at seven days. Renal biopsy showed granulomatous interstitial nephritis and negative AFB stain. Prednisone 40 mg was started and renal function partially improved. Blood cultures obtained before biopsy subsequently grew M. chimaera. Three-drug antimicrobial therapy was initiated and prednisone discontinued. One month later, creatinine improved and follow up echocardiogram showed no lesion. Our case highlights this rare infection inducing granulomatous interstitial nephritis despite lack of positive AFB or gram stains on renal biopsy."

However, analysis of data obtained from the Registry for Tuberculosis and National Reference Laboratory for Mycobacteria at University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik from January 2000 to December 2017 revealed that the number of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) isolates is increasing. A group of slowly growing NTM and a common cause of NTM disease among humans is the Mycobacterium avium complex, the taxonomy of which is rapidly changing. M. intracellulare and M. chimaera are part of the Mycobacterium avium complex, and together represent 19.6% of all isolated NTM species in Slovenia. Due to the high genotypic and phenotypic similarity between M. intracellulare and M. chimaera species, both species are difficult to differentiate. A method that can be used to successfully distinguish between M. intracellulare and M. chimaera is the molecular assay GenoType NTM-DR. Mutations in the rrl and rrs genes that are associated with macrolide and aminoglycoside resistance, respectively, can also be detected with this method. Overall, 222 clinical isolates were tested, and the nationwide study showed that 44.6% of the previously identified M. intracellulare species were actually M. chimaera. Further, this study showed that none of the tested M. intracellulare and M. chimaera isolates harboured mutations in the rrl and rrs genes. The genotyping result that no isolates were resistant to macrolides or aminoglycosides was also confirmed phenotypically with the broth microdilution method. Among isolates from the Slovenian Mycobacterial Isolates Collection all these tested strains (n = 222) were sensitive to macrolides and aminoglycosides."

The impact of MAC subspecies on the risk of disease progression remains uncertain in MAC-LD patients. METHODS: In this cohort study, we included MAC-LD patients from 2013 to 2018 and classified them into M. intracellulare, M. avium, M. chimaera and other subspecies groups by genotype. We observed the disease progression of MAC-LD, indicated by antibiotic initiation and/or radiographic progression. We used Cox regression analysis to assess predictors for disease progression. RESULTS: Of 105 MAC isolates from unique MAC-LD patients, 35 (33%) were M. intracellulare, 41 (39%) M. avium, 16 (15%) M. chimaera, and 13 (12%) other subspecies. After a mean follow-up time of 1.3 years, 56 (53%) patients developed disease progression: 71% (25/35), 54% (22/41), 31% (4/13), and 31% (5/16) in patients with M. intracellulare, M. avium, others, and M. chimaera, respectively. The independent predictors for disease progression were M. chimaera subspecies (HR 0.356, 95% CI [0.134-0.943]), compared with the reference group of M. intracellulare, body mass index <= 20 kg/m2 (HR 1.788 [1.022-3.130]), and initial fibrocavitary pattern (HR 2.840 [1.190-6.777]) after adjustment for age, sex, and sputum-smear positivity. Among patients without fibrocavity lesions (n=94), the risk of disease progression significantly decreased in patients with other subspecies (HR 0.217 [0.050-0.945]) and remained low in those with M. chimaera (HR 0.352 [0.131-0.947]). CONCLUSIONS: M. chimaera was not uncommon in this study; unlike M. intracellulare, it was negatively correlated with disease progression of MAC-LD, suggesting a role of MAC subspecies identification in prioritizing patients."

Mycobacterium chimaera is a slow-growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium responsible for an infection, which is difficult to treat and has often a devastating course. Until now, M. chimaera infection has been shown to occur up to 8 years after operation. We report a patient presenting with an aortic pseudoaneurysm who developed M. chimaera infection 12 years after repair of an acute type A aortic dissection with graft replacement of the ascending aorta and stent-grafting of the arch. As far as we know, this is the case with the longest incubation period of M. chimaera infection.

Recently, a worldwide investigation conducted in hospitalized infected patients has detected M. chimaera in several Stockert 3T HCUs manufactured by LivaNova. AIM: Microbiological surveillance on Stockert 3T (LivaNova) and HCU40 Maquet (Getinge) devices as well as an evaluation of the efficacy of their recommended decontamination protocols. METHODS: A total of 308 water samples were collected from 29 HCUs: 264 samples were collected from 17 Stockert 3T HCUs by LivaNova and 44 samples from 12 HCUs40 2 Maquet by Getinge. Samples were tested for total viable counts (TVCs) both 22  and 37 C, P. aeruginosa, coliform bacteria and NTM. The microbiological surveillance began in June 2017 and ran until October 2019. FINDINGS: We analyzed 308 HCU water samples, 65.5% of which yielded NTM. The most frequently colonized device with NTM was the Stockert 3T (88.2%), with a frequency of positive samples of 59.5% (157/264). The HCUs Maquet devices less frequently yielded NTM (33.3%), with a frequency of positive water samples of 13.6% (6/44). Disinfection procedures proved effective in reducing TVCs of bacteria with the exception of NTM species. NTM were detected in both pre-disinfection (50.1%) and post-disinfection (55.7%) samples, and no significant association was found between disinfection and NTM results both in Stockert 3T and HCUs40. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that manufacturer's procedures for disinfection are ineffective and/or inadequate. Until effective disinfection protocols become available, the only way to minimize the risk of NTM contamination is to closely monitor the water quality in the cooler-heater, keep it as clean as possible, and treat it like any other biohazardous material."

Skin scrapings demonstrated Demodex cati mites. Antibiotics were administered and it was treated successfully for periocular demodectic mange, but the cat continued to exhibit respiratory signs and lose weight. Further investigation revealed an ascarid infection and active chronic inflammation of undetected cause affecting the lower airways. Repetitive treatment with pyrantel failed to eradicate the ascarid infection. The cat became cachectic and developed moist ulcerative dermatitis of the neck, severe non-regenerative anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Necropsy and histopathology revealed mycobacteriosis affecting skin, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, liver and kidney. Attempted culture of frozen tissues at a mycobacteria reference laboratory was unsuccessful. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue was retrieved and examined using PCR to amplify part of the 16S rRNA gene. A diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium genavense infection was made based on the presence of acid fast bacteria in many tissues and partial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene. Although M genavense has been identified previously as a cause of disseminated disease in AIDS patients, this is the first report of infection in a cat. It was suspected that the demodecosis, recurrent ascarid infections and disseminated M genavense infection resulted from an immune deficiency syndrome consequent to longstanding FIV infection."

Nevertheless, diseases caused by other mycobacteria have to be considered clinically and in diagnostic pathology especially in cases of immunosuppression and due to their potential zoonosis risk. An infection by mycobacteria was diagnosed in four animals (Mayotte Maki, Blue-headed Parrot, Patagonian sealion, Beagle) necropsied between 1995 and 2002 in the Institute of Veterinary-Pathology of the University of Leipzig. The Maki, the blue-headed parrot and the dog showed a disseminated character of the disease caused by Mycobacterium genavense (monkey and bird) resp. Mycobacterium avium (dog), while an open chronical tuberculosis of the lungs due to a pathogenic member of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was observed in the seal. All these bacteria are potential causes of zoonoses. So, if granulomatous or disseminated histiocytic alterations are detected in diagnostic pathology, mycobacterial infections should always be included in differential diagnoses and require careful aetiological investigations by histopathological and bacteriological methods."

METHODS: We report the findings of an observational study. RESULTS: Among 51 patients (43 with Mycobacterium avium complex [MAC] infection, 2 with Mycobacterium genavense infection, and 6 whose samples were smear positive but culture negative) from 1993-2004, the median follow-up period was 29 months. The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial immune reconstitution syndrome was 3.5% among patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with a baseline CD4+ cell count of &lt;100 cells/microL. Three main clinical presentations were peripheral lymphadenitis (in 17 patients), pulmonary-thoracic disease (in 15 patients), and intra-abdominal disease (in 13 patients). Six other patients had cases that involved joint, spine, prostate, skin, soft tissue, and spontaneously resolving MAC bacteremia. Disease was usually localized. Median CD4+ cell counts before initiation of HAART and at diagnosis were 20 and 120 cells/microL, respectively, and the median reduction in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load was 2.5 log10 copies/mL. Intra-abdominal disease was frequently preceded by disseminated MAC infection (in 62% of cases, compared with 6%-33% of cases for other groups; P=.003) and accounted for 16 (43%) of 36 hospitalizations (compared with 5%-35% for other groups; P=.008). The relapse rate was not higher among 10 patients who received no MAC therapy or received MAC therapy for &lt; or =2 weeks. Prednisone was associated with clinical responses in 8 (89%) of 9 patients with evaluable cases. In total, 7 patients (14%) had 13 subsequent culture-positive MAC events (6 of which were cases of immune reconstitution syndrome, and 7 of which were cases of disseminated MAC infection). Ten patients (20%) died (2 of disseminated MAC infection, 5 of other opportunistic infections, and 3 of HIV-unrelated causes). CONCLUSIONS: Nontuberculous mycobacterial immune reconstitution syndrome has a wide range of clinical presentations and severity. The long-term prognosis is favorable for HAART-adherent patients. Intra-abdominal disease is associated with greater morbidity than is peripheral lymphadenitis. The role of antimycobacterial therapy is uncertain, given the self-limited course of most nonabdominal cases."

American Thoracic Society criteria for environmental mycobacterial disease were met in 34 (22.7%) patients: 14 in the silicosis group and 20 in the non-silicosis group. Treatment was administered in 24 cases, with better bacteriological eradication levels in the non-silicosis group. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, a history of silicosis was related with a higher incidence of environmental mycobacterial disease. The causative species in the majority of cases in our setting was Mycobacterium avium complex, followed by Mycobacterium genavense. Patients with silicosis showed lower cure rates after treatment."

He presented with anorexia, diarrhoea, cachexia and multiple firm violaceous nodules distributed over the face, neck and upper and lower extremities. Biopsy of a skin nodule was performed, confirming KS. Immunoperoxidase staining for human herpesvirus 8 was strongly positive. Endoscopic examination revealed erosive duodenopathy. Multiple biopsy samples showed numerous acid-fast bacilli at direct microscopic examination. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) identified M. genavense. A CT scan showed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with a 'tree-in-bud' appearance, striking splenomegaly and abdominal lymphadenopathy. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing typical Kaposi's lesions in the upper respiratory tract. RT-PCR of bronchial aspirate identified M. genavense and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Despite treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy, antimycobacterial therapy and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, the outcome was fatal. "

We retrospectively examined the incidence of mycobacterial diseases within a randomized prospective trial of prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and toxoplasmosis. Of 501 participants who had not previously had a mycobacterial disease, 274 received dapsone/pyrimethamine (200/75 mg once weekly) and 227 received aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once every 4 weeks). The median CD4 lymphocyte count was 113/microL, and the median duration of treatment was 369 days. Six cases of tuberculosis, 22 of MAC infection, and 3 of Mycobacterium genavense disease occurred during treatment. Stratified by basement CD4 lymphocyte counts, the annual product-limit incidence of mycobacterial disease was 5% during treatment with dapsone/pyrimethamine vs. 12% during treatment with aerosolized pentamidine for patients whose counts were 0-24/microL, 0 vs. 12% for those whose counts were 25-49/microL, and 7% vs. 9% for those whose counts were 50-99/microL. Adjusted for CD4 lymphocyte counts at start of treatment, the relative risk for patients receiving dapsone/pyrimethamine was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-1.16; P = .10). This inexpensive and simple regimen may prevent mycobacterial diseases and warrants further investigation as a means of prophylaxis for multiple opportunistic diseases."

During the study period, 50 patients with hematological malignancy and tuberculosis (TB) were also evaluated. Among 2,846 patients with hematological malignancy, 34 (1.2%) patients had NTM infections. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (13 patients, 38%) was the most commonly isolated species, followed by M. abscessus (21%), M. fortuitum (18%), and M. kansasii (18%). Twenty-six patients had pulmonary NTM infection and eight patients had disseminated disease. Neutropenia was more frequently encountered among patients with disseminated NTM disease (p = 0.007) at diagnosis than among patients with pulmonary disease only. Twenty-five (74%) patients received adequate initial antibiotic treatment. Five of the 34 patients died within 30 days after diagnosis. Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that chronic kidney disease (p = 0.017) and neutropenia at diagnosis (p = 0.032) were independent prognostic factors of NTM infection in patients with hematological malignancy. Patients with NTM infection had higher absolute neutrophil counts at diagnosis (p = 0.003) and a higher 30-day mortality rate (15% vs. 2%, p = 0.025) than TB patients.

Human infections are mostly disseminated in the setting of the AIDS epidemic or the use of aggressive immunosuppressive treatments. M. genavense culture is fastidious, requiring supplemented media. Pulmonary involvement rarely occurs as a primary localization. CASES PRESENTATION: We report here two patients with pneumonia as the predominant manifestation of M. genavense infection: one kidney transplanted patient and one HIV-infected patient. Both patients were initially treated with anti-tuberculous drugs before the identification of M. genavense on sputum or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid culture. A four-drug regimen including clarithromycin and rifabutin was started. Gamma interferon has been helpful in addition to antimycobacterial treatment for one patient. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware that M. genavense could be the etiologic agent of sub-acute pneumonia mimicking tuberculosis in patients with cellular immunodeficiency status."

Exacerbation of infectious pneumonitis and interstitial pneumonia required complementary inpatient treatment in August 2007. Although polymerase chain reaction examination of expectorated sputa revealed the absence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. intracellulare on admission, nontuberculous M. abscessus was detected in the routine blood cultures. Taken together with clinical findings, M. abscessus was most likely the primary causative organism. Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be highly helpful for diagnosis."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium gordonaeID:22305672TITLE:[Atypical mycobacteria and pulmonary involvement in infectious diseases].ABSTRACT:Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly associated with infectious pulmonary disease. NTM are ubiquitous environmental pathogens with high isolation rates worldwide. The greater frequency of NTM associated with pulmonary diseases is probably due to a combination of increased exposure, improved diagnostic methods and an increase in the prevalence of risk factors predisposing individuals to infection. Difficulty may arise in determining whether an isolate from a respiratory sample is in fact a contaminant or a pathogenic organism. The ATS/IDSA guidelines highlight the importance of following microbiological and clinical criteria in making a diagnosis of NTM lung infection. These criteria may not be useful for all NTM and species-level identification is strongly recommended. Mycobacteria identification by conventional methods has been the standard in most clinical microbiology laboratories. However, conventional testing alone does not allow identification of many NTM. Newer, rapid molecular methods such as commercially available nucleic acid probes, genomic amplification and DNA sequence analysis should be used. Communication between the clinician and the laboratorian is essential to decide whether an isolate could be sent to a reference laboratory to determine the best method for species identification. Although the CLSI has recently published an approved standard for NTM susceptibility testing, there is ongoing debate about the role of in vitro susceptibility for managing patients with NTM disease. The goal of this review is to describe the mycobacteria involved in lung disease, the factors that predispose to this infection, its diagnosis with alternative procedures and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response."

We investigated the trends of NTM lung disease at a tertiary hospital in Korea and evaluated the contribution of liquid culture systems. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of mycobacterial cultures of respiratory specimens from 26,793 patients at Severance Hospital in South Korea from January 2006 to December 2010. RESULTS: The recovery percent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was 5.9% in 2006 and 7.1% in 2010, and the recovery percent of NTM isolates was 2.0% in 2006 and 6.3% in 2010. The annual percent of NTM isolation has increased steadily every year (p for trend &lt; 0.001), and the proportion of patients from whom NTM was isolated increased from 21.4% in 2006 to 55.0% in 2010 (p for trend &lt; 0.001).

This results, in part, from incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. OBJECTIVES: To study pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions of multidrug treatment regimens in a large cohort of patients with MAC lung disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected pharmacokinetic data of all patients treated for MAC lung disease in the Adult Care Unit at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, in the January 2006 to January 2010 period; we retrospectively calculated areas under the time-concentration curve (AUC). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of their MAC isolates were retrieved for pharmacodynamic calculations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 531 pharmacokinetic analyses, performed for 481 patients (84% females; mean age, 63 yr; mean body mass index, 21.6). Peak serum concentrations (C(max)) below target range were frequent for ethambutol (48% of patients); clarithromycin (56%); and azithromycin (35%). Concurrent administration of rifampicin led to 68%, 23%, and 10% decreases in C(max) of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin. C(max)/MIC or AUC/MIC ratios associated with bactericidal activity were seldom met; 57% of patients achieved target ratios for ethambutol, versus 42% for clarithromycin, 19% for amikacin, 18% for rifampicin, and 11% for moxifloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Currently recommended regimens for MAC lung disease yield important pharmacologic interactions and low concentrations of key drugs including macrolides. Pharmacodynamic indices for rifampicin, clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin are seldom met. This may partly explain the poor outcomes of currently recommended treatment regimens.

METHODS: From July 2000 to August 2007, 369 patients (mean age 58.3 years; 169 males and 200 females) with pulmonary NTM infection were retrospectively reviewed. Of these 369 patients, 24 ICPs (mean age 64.8 years; 15 males and 9 females) were identified. 16 patients had diabetes mellitus, and 6 patients had received long-term steroid therapy. One had received solid organ transplantation and one had received high-dose chemotherapy for haematological disease. 24 age- and sex-matched immunocompetent patients (mean age 64.6 years; 15 males and 9 females) were selected as the control group from the same registry. CT images were reviewed in consensus by three chest radiologists, who were blinded to immune status. Each lung lobe was evaluated in terms of extent of the lesion, bronchiectasis, parenchymal opacity and the presence of ancillary findings. results: A total of 287 lobes were evaluated in ICPs and the control group. The ICPs showed a higher prevalence of ill-defined nodules, with cavities and large opacity &gt;2 cm with/without cavity (p=0.03, 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). Regardless of the immune status, the most common CT findings were bronchiectasis and ill-defined nodules without cavity.

One-liter water samples and swabs were collected from all taps, and swimming pools or rainwater tanks. Shower aerosols were sampled using Andersen six-stage cascade impactors. For a subgroup of patients, real-time PCR was performed and high-resolution melt profiles were compared to those of ATCC control strains. Pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from 19 homes. Species identified in the home matched that found in the patient in seven (35%) cases: M. abscessus (3 cases), M. avium (1 case), M. gordonae (1 case), M. lentiflavum (1 case), and M. kansasii (1 case).

Natural course on serial computed tomographic scans.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: Existing literature is inconclusive regarding how the nodular bronchiectatic form of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease will progress without treatment and when treatment initiation should be considered. OBJECTIVES: To assess the natural course of MAC pulmonary disease by serial thin-section computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Of 339 patients with nodular bronchiectatic form of MAC disease, we selected 265 untreated patients who had serial CTs (mean observation period, 32 +- 21 mo). Two independent chest radiologists reviewed retrospectively all CT scans for the presence and extent of lung abnormalities (maximal total score, 30). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 265 patients, 126 patients (48%) had disease that had progressed and that needed treatment owing to radiologic deterioration or worsening symptoms, and the remaining 139 patients (52%) did not. On multivariate analysis, the presence of cavity (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.06; P = 0.004) and consolidation (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; P = 0.019) at initial CT remained as independent factors associated with disease progression and treatment requirement. The presence of cavitary lesions demonstrated the highest positive predictive value (61%) and significant correlation (P = 0.005) with smear positivity. Differences in the extent of each pattern and total CT score in the serial studies were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.05) in patients requiring treatment. The total CT score increased by 2.41 in the treatment-requiring group compared with 0.25 in the group that did not receive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Without treatment, about half of patients demonstrate progressive disease on serial CT over a mean follow-up period of 32 months and, thus, required treatment. Patients showing cavities or consolidation on initial CT are more likely to have progressive disease and thus to require treatment eventually."

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL &lt;0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration."

A CT scan of the thorax revealed multiple small nodules and consolidation over both lungs with cavitation. Sputum culture repeatedly grew M brisbanense species nova, a novel species never before isolated in Malaysia. The case met the American Thoracic Society criteria for the diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. There was dramatic clinical and radiologic response to treatment with an empirical combination of rifampicin, ethambutol, and levofloxacin and subsequently clarithromycin and levofloxacin once sensitivity was known. This report is the first, to our knowledge, of the pathogen isolated in a patient with chronic cavitary lung infection since it was first identified from an antral sinus in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and the first time it is isolated from a human subject in Malaysia."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium gordonaeID:24740640TITLE:Surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.ABSTRACT:While the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been decreasing, the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease has been increasing. Unlike tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is not communicable. However, their indolent nature may result in extensive parenchymal destruction, causing respiratory failure and vulnerability to airway infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, therefore, has been becoming a significant health problem. According to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement on nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, the primary treatment is a multidrug treatment regimen. However, its efficacy is less than satisfactory for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, which is the most common type of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, and for Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease, which is notoriously resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The statement, therefore, has proposed a multidisciplinary treatment approach for these types of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases: a combination of multidrug treatment regimen and adjuvant resectional surgery. This review covers the rationale, indication, procedure, and outcome of surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. The rationale of surgery is to prevent disease progressing by removing the areas of lung most affected, harboring the largest amounts of mycobacteria. The indications for surgery include a poor response to drug therapy, the development of macrolide-resistant disease, or the presence of a significant disease-related complication such as hemoptysis. The surgical procedures of choice are various types of pulmonary resections, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. The reported series have achieved favorable treatment outcomes in surgically treated patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. "

Impression smears and histopathology confirmed pyogranulomatous pneumonia, with large amounts of lipid corresponding to the green structures noted cytologically, and identified poorly staining bacterial rods within lipid vacuoles. Special stains confirmed the presence of acid-fast bacterial rods, and polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing identified the organism as Mycobacterium fortuitum. M. fortuitum pneumonia is well described in humans and has previously been reported in 4 dogs and 1 cat. Lipid was a prominent cytologic and histologic feature, as is often described in humans and in the single feline case report.

The bacteriological characteristics of the strain were determined. METHODS: Species identification was performed by homologue gene sequence comparison, then a series of biochemical tests was conducted to elucidate the bacteriological characteristics. Drug susceptibility and pathogenicity to mice of the strain were tested. RESULTS: The clinical M. parascrofulaceum strain presented a very similar phenotypic profile to that of Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. The M. parascrofulaceum strain was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin in vitro. At week 2 post-infection, the lung tissues of mice demonstrated a local inflammatory response denoted by peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates. At weeks 4 and 8, the lung tissues showed peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates with large aggregates of lymphocytes and part of the tissue showed granulomatous lesions; there was no appreciable necrosis. The colony-forming units (CFU) count of infected lung and spleen increased gradually during the 8 weeks of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The M. parascrofulaceum strain isolated in China was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin. The mycobacteria were capable of proliferating in mice and could lead to pathological changes in the lungs of the mice."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary NTM infection and pulmonary NTM disease. METHODS: A retrospective review of the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens from January 2007 to May 2013. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were identified with at least one respiratory NTM isolate and 56 patients (46%) fulfilled the microbiological ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. Of patients with adequate data, 16% fulfilled the complete ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. The incidence of pulmonary NTM infection and disease was 18.9 and 8.8 per 100.000 inpatients and outpatients, respectively. The spectrum of NTM species was high (13 species) and predominated by M. avium-intracellulare complex (M. avium (13%), M. intracellulare (10%)), M. gordonae (14%), and M. fortuitum (12%). The ratio of isolation of NTM to M. tuberculosis in all hospitalized patients was 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: The first data on the epidemiology of pulmonary NTM in Athens, Greece, are presented.

We examined the risk factors associated with treatment outcome in Taiwanese adults with pulmonary disease caused by the M. abscessus complex. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients from a southern Taiwan medical center from 2006 to 2012 who had respiratory specimens identified as M. abscessus complex and met the American Thoracic Society criteria for pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Of the 106 included patients, females (58.5%) and nonsmokers (79.2%) predominated. The mean age of patients was 64.8 years. Sixty-three patients (59.4%) had pre-existing lung disease. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (34.9%) was the most common underlying disorder. Chest radiography indicated that bronchiectasis was common (47.2%) and that cavitations were less common (14.2%). Fifty-six patients received antibiotic treatment. Clinicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics if the initial sputum acid-fast staining was positive (p &lt; 0.001). Treatment outcome was analyzed in 26 patients who were treated for more than 3 months; three of these patients (11.5%) had clinical failure and 18 (69.2%) experienced sputum conversion. Patients with cavitary lesions were more likely to experience microbiologic failure (p = 0.02). Nine patients had positive cultures after antibiotic treatment for &gt; 1 year. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (p = 0.011) and cavitary lesion (p = 0.034) are risk factors for persistence of M. abscessus complex. CONCLUSION: With antimicrobial therapy, previous mycobacterial disease, and cavitary lesion are associated with microbiologic failure in Taiwanese adults with M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease."

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

We investigated the characteristics and clinical impact of NTM isolation in this population. Medical records of adult patients who underwent SCT at the blood and marrow transplantation center at a University Hospital in South Korea between January 2004 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five of 2,658 patients were enrolled, an incidence of 0.94%. The most common NTM species isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 15) and Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 5). Sixteen patients were co-infected with other pathogens, including Aspergillus species (10 cases). Nonspecific pneumonia and cavitary pneumonia were the most common radiologic patterns. Sixteen patients had underlying lung graft-versus-host disease, including bronchiolitis obliterans (10 cases) with moderate obstructive lung defects. Whereas two of 10 patients who were treated for NTM died as a result of NTM progression, one of 15 patients who were not treated died of the same cause. This study shows that the incidence of respiratory NTM detection in SCT recipients was low and its virulence was not higher than expected. As patients frequently had concomitant infections and underlying lung diseases that made radiologic evaluation more difficult, we suggest that it would be advantageous to perform repeated microbiologic studies when NTM infection is clinically suspected."

In total, 452 nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains isolated from patients with NTM lung diseases in four specialised TB hospitals were enrolled in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to evaluate the drug susceptibility of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM lung diseases caused by M. avium and M. intracellulare were analysed. Of 452 NTM isolates, M. intracellulare (188; 41.6%) was the most frequently isolated organism. The percentages of moxifloxacin- and linezolid-resistant strains among the M. intracellulare isolates were significantly lower than those among the M. avium group (P=0.003 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, M. avium harboured a lower proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains than M. intracellulare (P=0.005). Among patients with M. intracellulare lung diseases, the percentages of patients aged &gt;64 years and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significantly higher than among patients with M. avium (P=0.008 for age and P=0.001 for COPD). In conclusion, these data demonstrated that M. intracellulare was the most common NTM species in China. This study also revealed that M. intracellulare and M. avium differed in their drug susceptibility profiles. In addition, clinical cases of M. intracellulare lung diseases were more likely to be found in the aged population and among patients with COPD co-morbidity. "

Patients with cDGS and mycobacterial infection have not previously been described. We present this case to illustrate that patients with cDGS are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and to discuss further antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to thymic transplantation. METHODS: A 13-month old male was identified as T cell deficient by the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay on newborn screening, and was subsequently confirmed to have cDGS. He presented with fever and cough, and was treated for chronic aspiration pneumonia as well as Pneumocystis jirovecii infection without significant improvement. It was only after biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes seen on CT that the diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii was made. We reviewed the literature regarding atypical mycobacterial infections and prophylaxis used in other immunocompromised patients, as well as the current data regarding cDGS detection through TREC newborn screening. RESULTS: Multiple cases of cDGS have been diagnosed via TREC newborn screening, however this is the first patient with cDGS and disseminated mycobacterial infection to be reported in literature. Thymic transplantation is the definitive treatment of choice for cDGS. Prophylaxis with either clarithromycin or azithromycin has been shown to reduce mycobacterial infections in children with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cDGS should receive thymic transplantion as soon as possible, but prior to this are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Severe, opportunistic infections may require invasive testing for diagnosis in patients with cDGS. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered to prevent disseminated mycobacterial infection in these patients."

We present the first case of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-associated IRIS (MAC-IRIS) that was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old homosexual Japanese man was referred to our hospital with fever and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and found to be HIV positive. After the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the patient's mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy gradually enlarged, and bilateral infiltrates appeared in the upper lung fields. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed five months after the initiation of cART and showed intense accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) corresponding to the lesions of infiltration as well as the mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. A bronchial wash culture and pathology findings led to a diagnosis of MAC-IRIS. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy with rifampicin, ethambutol, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin was started. One year after the chemotherapy was initiated, there was a significant reduction in FDG uptake in the area of the lesions except in the mediastinal lymph node. This implied incomplete resolution of the MAC-IRIS-related inflammation. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy was continued because of the residual lesion. To date, the patient has not experienced a recurrence of MAC-IRIS, a period of nine months. CONCLUSION: We present a case of MAC-IRIS in an HIV-infected patient whose disease activity was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our data suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for evaluating the disease activity of NTM-IRIS and assessing the appropriate duration of anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy for NTM-IRIS in HIV-infected patients."

Previous reports have demonstrated that cervical lymphadenitis of children is the most frequent pathology of M. lentiflavum. However, there are little reports regarding pulmonary diseases by M. lentiflavum specifically in immunocompetent patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man having prolonged productive cough and dyspnea with fever was initially diagnosed as pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. Imaging studies showed that the radiologic abnormality was acute bronchopneumonic infiltration with abscess formation in the left lower lobe and parapneumonic pleural effusion. M. lentiflavum was identified in the cultured pleural tissues. On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed as pulmonary infection and pleurisy caused by M. lentiflavum, which was treated with a combination of antibiotics covering NTM. His clinical manifestations were dramatically improved by the treatment targeting NTM, while those were refractory to empirical antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: In this report, we introduce the isolation of M. lentiflavum from pleural tissues associated with acute necrotizing pneumonia combined with parapneumonic effusion in an immunocompetent host, suggesting that the M. lentiflavum can be a human pathogen invovled in pulmonary infectious diseases and pleurisy with poor response to empirical antibiotic treatment."

Pulmonary disease caused by NTM has emerged as a major threat to the health of individuals with CF but remains difficult to diagnose and problematic to treat. In response to this challenge, the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) convened an expert panel of specialists to develop consensus recommendations for the screening, investigation, diagnosis and management of NTM pulmonary disease in individuals with CF. Nineteen experts were invited to participate in the recommendation development process. Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) methodology and systematic literature reviews were employed to inform draft recommendations. An anonymous voting process was used by the committee to reach consensus. All committee members were asked to rate each statement on a scale of: 0, completely disagree, to 9, completely agree; with 80% or more of scores between 7 and 9 being considered 'good' agreement. Additionally, the committee solicited feedback from the CF communities in the USA and Europe and considered the feedback in the development of the final recommendation statements. Three rounds of voting were conducted to achieve 80% consensus for each recommendation statement. Through this process, we have generated a series of pragmatic, evidence-based recommendations for the screening, investigation, diagnosis and treatment of NTM infection in individuals with CF as an initial step in optimising management for this challenging condition.

Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility. METHODS: Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria. RESULTS: Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients with ABPM focusing on the frequency of pNTM and cLRTIs, acute exacerbation of cLRTIs, and pneumonia. Results During a median follow-up period of 2,299 days (range, 118-6,138 days), 7 patients developed pNTM (mainly Mycobacterium avium complex), and 21 patients developed cLRTI (mostly from Staphylococcus aureus followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Twelve patients developed 21 episodes of acute exacerbation of cLRTIs, and 4 patients developed pneumonia. Conclusion Patients with ABPM can have concomitant NTM infection and, not uncommonly, cLRTI, and they can also sometimes develop pneumonia or an acute exacerbation of cLRTI. "

The development of molecular methods has allowed the characterization of new species and the identification of NTM to the precise species and subspecies levels. The incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease are increasing worldwide, and this syndrome accounts for the majority of clinical cases of NTM disease. Common causative organisms of pulmonary infection are the slowly growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium kansasii and the rapidly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex. NTM lung disease often affects elderly people with chronic lung disease and may be a manifestation of a complex genetic disorder determined by interactions among multiple genes, as well as environmental exposures. To be diagnosed with NTM lung disease, patients should meet all clinical and microbiologic criteria, but the decision to start treatment is complex, requiring careful individualized analysis of risks and benefits. Clinicians should be alert to the unique aspects of NTM lung disease, including the need for proper diagnosis, the availability of advanced molecular methods for species and subspecies identification, and the benefits and limitations of recommended treatments."

M.fortuitum can cause different types of disease including pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, cutaneous disease, and disseminated disease. However, the infection presenting as septicemia is exceedingly rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old immunocompromised male with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type was admitted to the hospital because of high fever for 10 days. DIAGNOSES: The pathogen identified twice in the hemoculture was M.fortuitum, but not in the sputum culture. The chest computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a chronic inflammatory infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin. OUTCOMES: The symptom of patient disappeared after the treatment for one week, and near-total absorption of the consolidation in CT after the treatment for one month. He continued the treatment for one year until the last negative hemoculture. LESSONS: Although the M.fortuitum infection presenting as septicemia is rare, a high suspicion of M.fortuitum is required, particularly in the immunosuppressive patients.

We selected 13 pathogens or syndromes implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks or other well-documented waterborne transmission (acute otitis externa, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), free-living ameba, Giardia, Hepatitis A virus, Legionella (Legionnaires' disease), nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Pseudomonas-related pneumonia or septicemia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio). We documented annual numbers of deaths in the United States associated with these infections using a combination of death certificate data, nationally representative hospital discharge data, and disease-specific surveillance systems (2003-2009). We documented 6,939 annual total deaths associated with the 13 infections; of these, 493 (7%) were caused by seven pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A total of 6,301 deaths (91%) were associated with infections from Pseudomonas, NTM, and Legionella, environmental pathogens that grow in water system biofilms. Biofilm-associated pathogens can cause illness following inhalation of aerosols or contact with contaminated water.

The microorganisms causing these infections most frequently are Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus complex. Their incidence has increased in the last three decades. After identifying an NTM in the respiratory tract, clinical and radiological aspects must be considered to determine if isolations are clinically relevant. Predisposing conditions that could contribute to infection must also be investigated. Pulmonary disease due to NTM is presented in three clinical forms: a) pneumonitis due to hypersensitivity; b) fibrocavitary form; and c) nodular-bronchiectasic. The diagnosis of respiratory disease due to NTM does not make it obligatory to immediately initiate treatment. Before initiating the latter, other factors must be considered, such as age, comorbidities, life expectancy, due to the prolonged nature of treatments, with potential side effects and, in many cases, only a slight response to the treatment."

However, little is known about the diagnostic indications for true M. fortuitum pulmonary infection and the natural history of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment against M. fortuitum pulmonary infection. Fifteen years before the referral, he underwent total gastrectomy, after which he experienced esophageal reflux symptoms. After the referral, the patient was closely monitored without antimicrobial therapy because of mild symptoms and no pathological evidence of M. fortuitum pulmonary infection. During the observation, chest imaging showed migratory infiltrates. Two years after the referral, his lung biopsy specimen revealed foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, indicating lipoid pneumonia. However, he was continually monitored without any treatment because there was no evidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Four years after the referral, he developed refractory pneumonia despite receiving adequate antibiotic therapy. After confirmation of granulomatous lesions, multiple antimicrobial therapy for M. fortuitum resulted in a remarkable improvement with no exacerbation for over 5 years. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed identical M. fortuitum strains in seven isolates from six sputum and one intestinal fluid specimens obtained during the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a patient with M. fortuitum pulmonary infection who presented with migratory infiltrates. The pathological evidence and microbiological analysis suggested that M. fortuitum pulmonary infection was associated with lipoid pneumonia and chronic exposure to gastrointestinal fluid. Therefore, physicians should carefully monitor patients with M. fortuitum detected from lower respiratory tract specimens and consider antimicrobial therapy for M. fortuitum infection when the patient does not respond to adequate antibiotic therapy against common pneumonia pathogens."

The prevalence of OIs differs among various countries in part due to different climates and socio-economic conditions. We, therefore, carried out the retrospective study at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan to comprehensively investigate the prevalence of OIs, predictors of OIs, and risk factors for in-hospital death among HIV-infected patients. Sichuan in West China is characterized by the largest population living with HIV/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) across China. In total, we reviewed 954 cases of HIV infection, admitted to the hospital during January 2014 to December 2015, and found that bacterial pneumonia (25.8%) was the most common OIs, followed by candida infection (18.3%), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (11.9%), tuberculosis (11.5%), infectious diarrhoea (9.3%), cryptococcus infection (7.3%), cytomegalovirus infection (4.9%), toxoplasmosis (4.6%), hepatitis C (4.0%), nontuberculous mycobacteria desease (2.2%) and Penicillium marneffei infection (0.3%). We also found two strongest risk factors for in-hospital mortality: CD4+T cell counts of less than 100 cells/muL and not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, the study revealed the specific pathogens causing bacterial pneumonia and/or candida infection, the effect of tuberculosis on CD4+T cell counts, and the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients.

Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of PNTM-associated CPA. In the present investigation, we aimed to elucidate the clinical course and prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 62 patients with CPA and a history of PNTM who were admitted to Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center between 2010 and 2015. Co-morbidities, causative microorganisms, radiological findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 69.5 years, and the median follow-up period was 4.2 years. The major underlying diseases, other than PNTM and CPA, were old pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia. The most common causative NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC; 37 patients; 59.7%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (20 patients; 32.3%). Survival was 83% after 1 year and 61% after 5 years. Use of systemic corticosteroids (hazard ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-9.51; P=0.00177) and C-reactive protein levels &gt;= 5.0 mg/dL (hazard ratio: 8.96, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-62.9; P=0.0014) at the time of CPA diagnosis were associated with increased over-all mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CPA frequently developed in patients with MAC and M. kansasii PNTM. The treatment course of PNTM was not associated with all-cause mortality. However, systemic corticosteroid use and high CRP levels were negative prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM.

RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (13%). After lung resection, 98 out of 108 patients (91%) achieved sputum culture conversion, eight (8.2%) of whom developed microbiological recurrence during the follow-up period. As a result, the success rate of adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD with drug resistance was 83%.

Mycobacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but in most cystic fibrosis centers it is performed less frequently than culture for other pathogens. Consensus today recommends just one annual mycobacterial culture for asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, a strategy likely to lead to diagnostic delays. Postponement of diagnosis might be the deciding factor in whether an early colonization turns into chronic infection. This review highlights the latest developments in knowledge about the pathogenicity and clinical consequences of M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease, addressing the central theme of why pulmonary infection requires early identification and aggressive antibiotic treatment.

Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common involved pathogen, followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (MABSC), while Mycobacterium kansasii is not a major concern. The rate of infection rate in lung transplant recipients is reported to range from 1.5-22.4%. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here four cases of NTM pulmonary infection and disease among 63 patients who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at our hospital. Those four occurred following living-donor transplantation in two patients, one with pulmonary arterial hypertension and one with bronchiectasia, and deceased donor lung transplantation in two patients, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and interstitial pneumonia, respectively. NTM was not detected in any of the patients prior to transplantation. The involved pathogens were Mycobacterium gordonae in one, MAC in one, and MABSC in two of these patients, which were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in two and sputum in two. The one case of MAC and two of MABSC were symptomatic with consolidation shown in chest CT images indicating possible pneumonia, while the one with M. gordonae had no symptoms and was detected by surveillance BAL. Onset time from detection of NTM was greater than 3 years in the three with MABSC and M. gordonae and less than 3 years in the one with MAC. Each patient required a decrease in immunosuppressive agents according to their condition, while antibiotics therapy was performed in the three who were symptomatic. Sputum culture findings became negative after several months and were maintained thereafter in all. CONCLUSION: An NTM infection leading to pulmonary disease can occur at any time following lung transplantation. Treatment should be considered depending on the involved pathogens, individual status, and disease severity."

Current guideline therapeutic regimens involving an intensive phase of intravenous (IV) antibiotics followed by a consolidation phase of inhaled and oral antibiotics are not evidence-based. The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical outcomes and clearance of Mycobacterium abscessus complex (M. abscessus) from respiratory cultures in children with CF M. abscessus PD. METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis evaluated the first course of treatment for M. abscessus PD in 33 children in Queensland, Australia between 2001 and 2015. Spirometry and nutritional outcomes 2 years pretreatment and 1 year posttreatment were compared with clearance or relapse/persistence of Mycobacterium abscessus complex from respiratory cultures. RESULTS: Nine of 18 children who completed therapy, cleared infection. Three of 7 children who completed only intensive therapy cleared sputum compared with 0/8 children who did not. The trajectory of the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s and age standardized body mass index significantly improved posttreatment in those that cleared sputum (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that current treatment recommendations for M. abscessus PD are associated with some success in clearing infection in children with CF and improvement in lung function and body mass index.

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium gordonaeID:30767776TITLE:Atypical bronchial carcinoid with postobstructive mycobacterial infection: case report and review of literature.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Pulmonary carcinoids are included in the group of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and derive from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. The incidence of these tumors is increasing, but disease awareness remains low among clinicians. The synchronous presentation of lung cancer and mycobacterial infection is well known but the combination of pulmonary carcinoid and mycobacterial infection is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a 45-year-old female who presented with recurrent pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed a consolidation in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with various courses of antibiotics without full recovery after six months. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a central mass in the left upper lobe. Bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial, well-defined lesion that totally obstructed the left upper lobe bronchus. Bronchial biopsy showed typical carcinoid tumor. Rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery was attempted, but we were unable to radically remove the tumor. Therefore lobectomy was performed. The surgical pathology specimen showed atypical bronchial carcinoid and consolidations in the lung parenchyma with granulomatous inflammation distally of the bronchial obstruction. Ziehl-Neelsen staining demonstrated acid fast bacilli indicative of mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case history illustrates the importance of careful surgical pathologic examination, not only of the resected tumor, but also of the postobstructive lung parenchyma. Specific postobstructive infections such as tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can have clinical implications."

Case presentation: In this case report we describe a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 6-week history of non-productive cough, pleuritic chest pain and weight loss. She had a history of gastric adenocarcinoma managed with a distal oesophagectomy and total gastrectomy and consequentially suffered severe post-operative gastric reflux. Initial cultures were negative but following a VATS lung biopsy Mycobacterium goodii was cultured and histology revealed an organising pneumonia. Treatment was with a prolonged course of steroids, amikacin and meropenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. Ongoing gastric dysmotility and weight loss showed clinical improvement with a novel approach of a combination of prokinetics and somatostatin analogues controlling risk of repeat aspiration and improving symptom control. Conclusions: This is an unusual case of organising pneumonia related to Mycobacterium goodii infection and highlights the importance of mycobacterial culture in unusual and unresolving cases of organising pneumonia. The importance of controlling symptoms related to gastric dysmotility and aspiration is also addressed."

DESIGN: Systematic review. We searched electronic databases and reference lists published between 1967 and 2018, restricted to non-accidental cases. RESULTS: Forty-four studies including 489 participants aged 1 day to 17 years from 13 countries were included. Cultural, medical, and behavioural rationale for oil-use was described. The clinical-radiological presentation varied widely. Diagnostic certainty was deemed highest if ELP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage/frozen section lung biopsy with documented extracellular lipid on cytological staining and/or fat analysis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection was identified in six studies: Mycobacterium fortuitum/chelonei, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium abscessus. Treatment comprised supportive therapy, corticosteroids, stopping oil, therapeutic lung-lavage and surgical resection. Outcomes were reported inconsistently. CONCLUSION: Paediatric ELP resulting from cultural and medical practices continues to be described globally.

METHODS: Minocycline MICs for 55 MAC clinical isolates from the Netherlands were determined. We also co-incubated primary isolated macrophages infected with MAC with minocycline. Next, we performed a 28 day HFS-MAC model dose-response study in which we mimicked pulmonary concentration-time profiles achieved in patients. The HFS-MAC model was sampled at intervals to determine the minocycline pharmacokinetics and MAC burden. We identified the AUC0-24/MIC ratios associated with 1.0 log10 cfu/mL kill below day 0 (stasis), defined as a bactericidal effect. We then performed 10000 Monte Carlo experiments to identify the optimal dose for a bactericidal effect in patients. RESULTS: The MIC for 50% and 90% of cumulative clinical isolates was 8 and 64 mg/L, respectively. Minocycline decreased MAC bacterial burden below stasis in primary isolated macrophages. In the HFS-MAC model, minocycline achieved a microbial kill of 3.6 log10 cfu/mL below stasis. The AUC0-24/MIC exposure associated with a bactericidal effect was 59. Monte Carlo experiments identified a minocycline susceptibility MIC breakpoint of 16 mg/L. At this proposed breakpoint, the clinical dose of 200 mg/day achieved the bactericidal effect exposure target in ~50% of patients, while 400 mg/day achieved this in 73.6% of patients, in Monte Carlo experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline at a dose of 400 mg/day is expected to be bactericidal. We propose a clinical trial for validation."

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

Previously reported cases of M. goodii infection have included prosthetic joint infections, pacemaker pocket infections, and pneumonia. We present a case of M. goodii bacteremia with concomitant pulmonary septic emboli that developed in a 32-year-old woman with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). The CVC had been placed one year previously for intermittent treatment with intravenous, broadspectrum antibiotics, administered by an outside physician for the treatment of symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease. Despite our recommendations, the patient declined follow-up in our Infectious Diseases clinic, opting to continue care under her chronic Lyme disease physician. This case clearly demonstrates the potential for serious medical complications that can arise from the inappropriate use of longterm intravenous antibiotics using a CVC to treat non-specific symptoms attributed to Lyme disease and patients should be counseled regarding these risks."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium gordonaeID:31690385TITLE:Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.ABSTRACT:Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis, and results in pulmonary infiltrates, tenacious mucus plugs that harbor hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus, elevations of total serum immunoglobulin E concentration and peripheral blood and sputum eosinophilia. Bronchiectasis is an irreversible complication of ABPA. The key to early diagnosis is to consider ABPA in anyone with asthma or cystic fibrosis and with a positive skin test result for Aspergillus, and/or recurrent infiltrates on radiographs. The differential diagnosis for ABPA in patients with asthma includes diseases in which there is an overlap of asthma, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and radiographic infiltrates. Examples include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, drug-induced pulmonary infiltrates, infection with a parasite, asthma with atelectasis, and lymphoma. Mucus plugging that causes a ""tree in bud"" pattern on computerized tomography examination of the lungs may be from ABPA or other conditions, such as nontuberculous (atypical) mycobacteria (Mycobacteria avium-Mycobacteria intracellulare complex). Prednisone is indicated to clear pulmonary infiltrates, and a usual course is for 3 months. Itraconazole and voriconazole are adjunctive, and drug-drug interactions must be considered because azoles decrease elimination of various medications. Although not familial in most patients, presentation of Aspergillus fumigatus f1 (Asp f1) antigen is restricted to specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR2 (HLA-DR2), and HLA-DR5. There is an increased number of CD4+ T-helper type 2 lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage, and A. fumigatus can serve as a growth factor of eosinophils potentiating the effects of interleukin (IL) 3, IL-5, and Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Eosinophils interact directly with A. fumigatus spores and generate extracellular traps, which can injure the bronchial epithelium."

Several studies have linked IgG4-RD to infections such as tuberculosis and actinomycosis. However, the coexistence of IgG4-RD and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) in a single pulmonary nodule has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old male patient presented with cough and sputum. A solitary pulmonary nodule suspicious of lung cancer was found on chest CT. DIAGNOSIS: Through video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy, a diagnosis of co-existing NTM and IgG4-RD in a single nodule was made. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was applied for pneumonia developed after surgery. The patient was also supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation since his pneumonia was refractory to medical treatment. OUTCOMES: The patient expired on the 60th postoperative day due to multiple organ failure. LESSONS: IgG4-RD can occur singularly or accompanied by other diseases. We report a solitary pulmonary nodule caused by NTM and concurrent IgG4-RD, suggesting a possible association between these 2 entities. Immunologic relations between IgG4-RD and accompanying infection should be further investigated."

NTM were identified in different clinical samples by microbiological culture and molecular-based methods. NTM were isolated from 14 patients, out of whom four (27%) were infected and were treated accordingly. Two were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), two with M. abscessus complex (MABSC) and one with M. intracellulare. Two patients had cystic fibrosis-related lung disease and improved after successful NTM eradication. One patient was HIV-positive and died. One patient had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-related pneumonia and is currently being followed-up. We conclude that NTM frequency in our center was low among pediatric patients. Whether this is inherent to Brazilian patients, due to the broad coverage of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine in Brazil, or a result of underdiagnosis remains to be elucidated."

In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

Given the limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of NTM treatment, this study aimed to evaluate the same among elderly patients. Material and methods: Patients diagnosed with NTM disease at a tertiary hospital from January 2007 to December 2017 were enrolled and data were then retrospectively collected. Data of elderly patients who received antimycobacterial treatment were then analyzed. Results: A total of 161 patients satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NTM disease. There were 40 elderly patients who received treatments. Of the patients, 60% received the guideline oriented standard regimens. Single drug regimens were administered to 22.5% of patients. Only 55.0% of the patients were able to continue any treatment. Treatment-related discontinuation was observed in 44.4% of discontinued or changed patients. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of patients with or without adverse events. Patients who were able to continue the treatment for >12 months had a lower proportion of activities of daily living (ADL) disability (nine in 18, 50.0% vs. three in 22, 13.6%, p = 0.018) and heart disease (six in 18, 33.3% vs. 1/22, 4.6%, p = 0.033). Sputum culture conversion was achieved in 28 out of 40 (70.0%) elderly patients treated, and those who achieved sputum culture conversion had more standard regimens prescribed than those who failed sputum culture conversion (21 in 28, 75% vs. 3 in 12, 25%; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Age may not be an obstacle for receiving the benefits of the treatment of NTM disease with a precise evaluation of patient's comorbidities. Furthermore, elderly patients without heart disease and ADL disability may have better rate of continuing the NTM treatment. The current study suggested that selecting standard regimens to treat pulmonary NTM is important for elderly patients."

However, a large-scale epidemiological study on this issue in Korea is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of NTM infection after lung transplant surgery in Korea. METHODS: Between October 2012 and December 2018, we retrospectively evaluated lung transplant recipients in a referral hospital in South Korea. A total of 215 recipients were enrolled. The median age at transplantation was 56 years (range, 17-75), and 62% were men. Bronchoscopy was performed according to the surveillance protocol and clinical indications. A diagnosis of NTM infection was defined as a positive NTM culture from a bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample, or two separate sputum samples. We determined NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America 2007 guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for conditional survival analysis in patients with follow-up of >=12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6.5%) were diagnosed with NTM infection at a median of 11.8 months (range, 0.3-51.4) after transplantation. Nine patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with NTM-PD, and the incidence rate was 1980/100,000 person-years. Mycobacterium abscessus was the most common species causing NTM-PD (66%), followed by M. avium complex (33%). The presence of NTM infection did not influence all-cause mortality among those who underwent follow-up for >=12 months (N = 133, log-rank P = 0.816).

It has in vitro activity against nontuberculous mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex, but clinical data for this indication are lacking. Methods: Omadacycline use was reviewed at an 804-bed academic medical center. Patients were included if they received omadacycline for culture-proven M abscessus disease in 2019. Results: Four patients received omadacycline for the treatment of culture-positive M abscessus disease in 2019. Two patients had cutaneous disease, 1 had pulmonary disease, and 1 had osteomyelitis and bacteremia. The patients received omadacycline for a median duration of 166 days (range, 104-227) along with a combination of other antimicrobial agents. Omadacycline-containing regimens were associated with a clinical cure in 3 of 4 patients, with 1 patient improving on ongoing treatment. Omadacycline's tolerability was acceptable for patients with M abscessus disease, with 1 patient discontinuing therapy in month 6 due to nausea. Conclusions: Omadacycline is a novel oral option for the treatment of M abscessus disease, for which safe and effective options are needed. Although this case series is promising, further data are required to determine omadacycline's definitive role in the treatment of M abscessus disease."

Most cases occur during lactation and are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species; parasites and Mycobacteria have rarely been reported to cause breast infections (Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases (9th edn);2019, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007;175:367). Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which are also referred to as atypical mycobacteria, mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT), or environmental mycobacteria are a large group of Mycobacteria which are becoming increasingly common cause of infection all over the world (Arch Dermatol. 2006;142:1287). NTM can cause infection diseases especially in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-positive hosts, most commonly in the lungs, skin and soft tissue, lymph nodes or rarely spread with multiorgan dissemination (Arch Plast Surg. 2014;41:759). Mycobacterium gordonae (M. gordonae) is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium that is considered the least pathogenic NTM. The organism is ubiquitous, and mostly isolated from soil and water. Despite its nonvirulent nature, clinically significant infections have been reported also in some immunocompetent patients (J Formosan Med Assoc. 2020, Clin Infect Dis. 1992;1229). We report the first documented case of breast infection in a young immunocompetent woman sustained by Mycobacterium Gordonae."

Methods: From January 2014 to December 2018, there were 1 006 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Chest Hospital for the first time and received examination by bronchoscopy. A total of 89 patients with complete data were selected, including 40 males and 49 females, aged 20 to 85 years, with 46 patients (52%) aged 60 years or older. The clinical symptoms and signs of the patients were analyzed with chest imaging, bronchoscopy and pathological examination results. Comparisons between groups were made by Chi-square test and t test. Results: The number of patients with NTM complicated with tracheobronchial lesions accounted for 8.9%(89/1 006) of those hospitalized with NTM and received bronchoscopy during the same period. Clinical symptoms included cough and sputum (89/89), different degrees of hemoptysis or blood sputum (52/89), and shortness of breath (50/89). Chest CT showed that 72 cases (72/89, 81%) had lung lesions involving more than 3 lung fields, and 83 cases (93%) had bronchiectasis and 63 cases (63/89, 71%) with cavities. Pulmonary atelectasis was shown in 45 cases (45/89, 51%). By bronchoscopy, 39 cases (39/89, 44%) were diagnosed as tuberculous lesions involving bilateral upper bronchi, while lesions of the right lower bronchus was found in 27 cases (27/89, 30%).The percentage of patients with multilobar bronchial involvement was 50.6%(45/89). The morphological characteristics of the bronchial lesions included scar stenosis or atresia in 63 cases (63/89, 71%), hyperemia and edema in 46 cases (46/89, 52%), and multiple types of lesions in 48 cases (48/89, 54%). Conclusions: Patients with NTM lung disease complicated with tracheobronchial inflammatory lesions did not have specific manifestations clinically. Lung lesions are extensive, often accompanied by bronchiectasis and cavity formation. Endoscopic changes were mostly manifested as multilobar tracheobronchial involvement characterized by scar stenosis, congestion and edema, mainly involving bilateral upper bronchi and the right lower bronchus."

Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and February 2019, 18 cases of NTM were diagnosed and their relevant clinical, diagnostic, and treatment details were recorded after taking informed consent. Results: We report 18 cases of NTM involving lungs (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), joint (n = 2), genitourinary (n = 1), and central nervous system (n = 1). History of immunosuppression was present in two patients, whereas history of some form of intervention was seen in six patients. Mycobacterium fortuitum group (n = 5) was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 4), Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 3), Mycobacterium kansasii (n = 2), and Mycobacterium chelonae (n = 1). In two patients, M. chelonae and M. abscessus were isolated in succession. Of these 18 patients, clinical response was present in 15 of the patients. Diagnosis and treatment of NTM in resource limited settings is extremely challenging. Conclusion: Most of the patients with NTM are misdiagnosed and are treated as tuberculosis in India, sometimes with a multidrug resistance regimen, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. We present these cases to shed some light on the epidemiology of NTM in this part of India."

However, studies about extrapulmonary NTM infections have been limited. Therefore, we aim to describe the diversity of extrapulmonary NTM infections and identify predictors for species. Information regarding diversity of NTM isolates, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, treatment regimens, and outcomes were collected from four tertiary care centers in South Korea. Comparisons were made between patients with rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) and slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM) infections. A total of 117 patients (46 males vs. 71 females) were included. Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) predominated (34.2%), followed by bone and joint infections (28.2%). In SSTIs, RGM species were predominantly identified (26/28, 92.9%), whereas SGM species were mainly identified in bone and joint infections (18/26, 69.2%), and the difference of isolated sites was verified by a post hoc test (p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that male sex (vs. female sex; OR 5.30, CI 1.35-24.26, p = 0.020) and bone and joint infections (vs. SSTIs; OR 18.10, CI 3.28-157.07, p = 0.002) were predictors of SGM infections, whereas the opposite was observed for RGM infections.

It is susceptible to multiple antibiotics both in vitro and in clinical practice, so that any combination of susceptible drugs is effective. However, we encountered a case of infection due to fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum. In this study, we report the case and describe the mechanism of resistance. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man with a history of total gastrectomy and immunosuppressant treatment for rheumatoid arthritis developed a recurrence of pulmonary infection caused by M. fortuitum. He was treated with clarithromycin and levofloxacin as a first-line treatment, based on the favorable susceptibility at that time. After recurrence, a high minimum inhibitory concentration to fluoroquinolones was detected. DNA sequencing of the pathogen showed the substitution of serine for tryptophan at residue 83 in the gyrA gene. He was successfully treated with a combination of other antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum and investigation of the mechanism of resistance. We suggest that the susceptibility test remains effective for determining the next line of treatment after a pathogen has acquired resistance, and resistance to fluoroquinolones in M. fortuitum can be attributed to a single change of amino acid."

Recent advances in analysis techniques have allowed the accurate identification of previously unknown NTM species. Here, we report a case of NTM-PD caused by a newly identified mycobacteria in an immunocompetent patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to the frequent aggravation of her chronic respiratory symptoms, with NTM-PD-compatible computed tomography findings. Unidentified mycobacterium was repeatedly isolated from respiratory specimens and we diagnosed her as NTM-PD of unidentified mycobacterium. Subsequent whole-genome analysis revealed that the unidentified mycobacterium was a novel mycobacterium genetically close to Mycolicibacterium mucogenicum. We started combination therapy with clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, and imipenem/cilastatin, referring to drug sensitivity test results and observed its effect on M. mucogenicum infection. Her symptoms and radiological findings improved significantly. CONCLUSION: We report a case of NTM-PD caused by a newly identified mycobacteria, Mycolicibacterium toneyamachuris, genetically close to M. mucogenicum. This pathogenic mycobacterium showed different characteristics from M. mucogenicum about clinical presentation and drug sensitivity. The clinical application of genomic sequencing will advance the identification and classification of pathogenic NTM species, and enhance our understanding of mycobacterial diseases."

The symptoms had started two months after continued use of an ultrasonic humidifier. He had hypoxemia on admission and late inspiratory crackles in both lungs on physical examination. The laboratory findings showed an increased white blood cell count and a C-reactive protein level, and his serum KL-6 level was slightly elevated, at 674 U/mL. Chest computed tomography showed diffuse ground-glass opacities, and histological examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy showed alveolitis without granulomas. The humidifier inhalation challenge test result was positive. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with humidifier lung. His symptoms gradually improved after avoiding the humidifier without taking medication. The humidifier water was contaminated by various bacteria and fungi, as well as Mycobacterium gordonae and a high concentration of endotoxin. Unlike in those with typical hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the elevation of serum KL-6 levels in humidifier lung patients is mild, and granulomas are not apparent on histological examination, similar to our case. Furthermore, the endotoxin identified from the humidifier is one of the known pathogens of humidifier lung. Thus, humidifier lung seems to have different characteristics compared to other hypersensitivity pneumonitis phenotypes. The mechanism driven by the high concentration of endotoxin could be one of the main causes of humidifier lung."

NTM lung disease has been identified as a predictor of mortality in CPA patients. The major risk factors for NTM-associated CPA include fibrocavitary NTM lung disease, the presence of pulmonary emphysema, and high-dose corticosteroid use. The onset of CPA is 1.5-7 years following the diagnosis of NTM lung disease. The diagnosis can be made using standard criteria; however, serological diagnosis using Aspergillus precipitin has demonstrated a higher sensitivity and specificity when compared with fungal culture from respiratory specimens. Treatment is challenging since rifampicin and oral triazoles should not be used concomitantly. The prognosis is poor, and the factors associated with worse prognosis are corticosteroid use and high C-reactive protein level."

Of these, 12 were reports of pseudo-outbreaks, i.e., the nosocomial transmission of organism from hospital ice/ice machines to patients, resulting in patient colonization, but with no disease manifestations. In addition, there were five outbreaks that resulted in clinical disease/pathology associated with NTM organism. Eleven different species of NTMs have been associated with these reports, where over half (59%) of the species identified were Mycobacterium fortuitum (18%), Mycobacterium gordonae (14%), Mycobacterium mucogenicum (14%), and Mycobacterium porcinum (14%). Several of these reports clearly documented that ice machines had been properly maintained, cleaned, and serviced in accordance with the CDC guidelines yet became contaminated with NTM organisms. These reports frequently detail that after extensive cleaning/disinfection following the discovery of NTM organisms, ice machines remained contaminated with NTM organisms, highlighting the difficulty in eradicating these from ice machines, once contaminated. Several reports identified that the only remedy to the contamination problem was to replace the ice machine with a new machine. Two qualitative risk assessment models are presented for (i) patients exposed to contaminated ice machine but before NTM colonization/infection and (ii) patients already colonized with NTMs from ice machines. Therefore, to protect immunocompromised/immunosuppressed patients' safety, especially during surgical or respiratory procedures, ice should not be sourced from the ice machine but should be made from sterile water and stored safely and separately away from the ice machine."

Associations were evaluated among residents of central North Carolina between pulmonary isolation of NTM and environmental risk factors including: surface water, drinking water source, urbanicity, and exposures to soils favorable to NTM growth. Reports of pulmonary NTM isolation from patients residing in three counties in central North Carolina during 2006-2010 were collected from clinical laboratories and from the State Laboratory of Public Health. This analysis was restricted to patients residing in single family homes with a valid residential street address and conducted at the census block level (n = 13,495 blocks). Negative binomial regression models with thin-plate spline smoothing function of geographic coordinates were applied to assess effects of census block-level environmental characteristics on pulmonary NTM isolation count. Patients (n = 507) resided in 473 (3.4%) blocks within the study area. Blocks with >20% hydric soils had 26.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8%, 58.0%), p = 0.03, higher adjusted mean patient counts compared to blocks with <=20% hydric soil, while blocks with >50% acidic soil had 24.8% (-2.4%, 59.6%), p = 0.08 greater mean patient count compared to blocks with <=50% acidic soil. Isolation rates varied by county after adjusting for covariates. The effects of using disinfected public water supplies vs. private wells, and of various measures of urbanicity were not significantly associated with NTM. Our results suggest that proximity to certain soil types (hydric and acidic) could be a risk factor for pulmonary NTM isolation in central North Carolina."

Four distinct clinical syndromes associated with NTM infection have been described: skin and soft tissue disease, lymphadenitis, disseminated disease and pulmonary disease. In children, lymphadenitis is the most common NTM clinical entity, particularly affecting those aged 1-5 years who have no known risk factors for disease. Optimal management of NTM lymphadenitis is not entirely clear, although surgical intervention is likely a definitive therapy. Disseminated NTM disease is uncommon and only seen in the setting of immunocompromise. In previously well children, this presentation should always lead to consideration of an underlying immune defect, such as Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. Identification of the underlying cause enables more targeted therapy and better prognostic understanding. Pulmonary NTM disease is fundamentally different to the other clinical syndromes, presenting in different hosts, who have different comorbidities, and follow a different clinical course."

This pathogen caused severe bilateral cavitary lung disease, making two surgical interventions necessary after years of chronic disease. This case prompted us to characterize this mycobacterium by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The isolate contained chemotaxonomic markers which were typical for the genus Mycobacterium, i.e., the meso isomer of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose, and galactose as diagnostic whole-cell sugars, MK-9(H(2)) as the principal isoprenoid quinone, a mycolic acid pattern of alpha-mycolates, ketomycolates, and wax ester mycolates, unbranched saturated and unsaturated fatty acids plus a significant amount of tuberculostearic acid, and small amounts of a C(20:0) secondary alcohol. On the basis of its unique 16S rRNA and 16S-23S spacer gene sequences, we propose that the isolate should be assigned to a new species, Mycobacterium heckeshornense.

Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection. RESULTS: The prevalence of NTM was 9.7% of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P &lt; 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7%), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1%), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5%), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8%) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS. CONCLUSION: NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure."

Large quantities of acid-fast microorganisms have been repeatedly observed in her sputum. Multiple courses of antimycobacterial treatment did not stop the progression of the disease. The mycobacterium involved was first identified as Mycobacterium gordonae, and later as Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. Analysis of part of the amplified gene of the 16S rRNA, however, revealed that its sequence differed from that of any established mycobacterial species, although it was observed once before in a German lymph node isolate, for which the name ""Mycobacterium interjectum"" has been proposed. Retrospective analysis confirmed the presence of this sequence in frozen samples which had been provided by the patient in 1983, 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1993. Our case confirms the value of amplification and sequencing of mycobacterial 16S rRNA for classifying mycobacteria, and suggests that ""Mycobacterium interjectum"" may be involved in cases of chronic destructive lung disease."

Conventional phenotypic methods failed to identify the species of these isolates, and high-performance liquid chromatography found that only one of the three isolates had a mycolic acid pattern similar to that of the type strain. In contrast, all three isolates were rapidly identified as M. interjectum by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Two isolates were recovered from the lymph nodes of children with cervical lymphadenitis, confirming the pathogenicity of this organism. However, the third isolate was obtained from the sputum of an elderly male with chronic lung disease without evidence of clinical or radiological progression, suggesting that isolation of M. interjectum should not imply disease. With the increasing use of molecular biology-based technology in mycobacterial laboratories, M. interjectum may be recognized more frequently as a pathogen or commensal organism."

The diagnosis of malignancy was made by intraoperative frozen section of resected tissue, the patients were performed lobectomy with systematic mediiastinal lymph nodes dissection. According to increment of detection of the small peripheral lesion, infectious disease such as MOTT can be detected as small abnormal shadow by CT. However, it is difficult to distinguish malignancy from infectious disease preoperatively.

Pneumococcal pneumonia occurred in 12 patients and all bacterial pneumonia (pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or other bacteria, as well as those with negative cultures but presumably bacterial in origin) in 40 patients. In the univariate analysis, immunodepressed patients (defined as those with less than 200 CD4+ T cell/microl), those without immunological response to HAART (defined as an increase of 25% of CD4+ T lymphocyte count), patients with previous admissions to hospital and those with cotrimoxazole or Mycobacterium avium intracellulare prophylaxis showed a higher incidence of both pneumococcal and all bacterial pneumonia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with a CD4+ lymphocyte count at the time of HIV diagnosis &lt;200 cells/microl. The multivariate model that was more valid for prediction of all bacterial pneumonia included a CD4+ T cell count &lt;200 cells/microl and absence of immunological response to HAART. Only in patients with a baseline CD4+ T cell count lower than 200/microl and immunological response to HAART, a near significant lower incidence of all bacterial pneumonia was observed after vaccination. Thus, these results do not support an important additional protective effect of 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine in HIV-patients with immunological response to HAART."

METHODS: A database search of primary care information for the dates and causes of death for all patients documented with HIV infection and living in Southern Alberta between 1984 and 2003 was undertaken. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Causes of death were then individually confirmed by reviewing the patients' hospital charts, autopsy reports, or death certificates and coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revisions. AIDS deaths were reconciled with Public Health Reports. The time span was divided into pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (1984-1996) and current HAART (1997-2003) periods. RESULTS: Between 1984 and 2003, there were 560 deaths in the 1987 individuals living with HIV infection in Southern Alberta. Of these, 436 deaths (78%) occurred pre-HAART and 124 (22%) in the current HAART period. The crude mortality rate declined from 117 deaths per 1000 patient-years pre-HAART to 24 in the current HAART period. In the pre-HAART era, 90% of all deaths were AIDS related whereas only 67% were AIDS related in the current HAART era. The leading causes of AIDS deaths were AIDS multiple causes (31%), Mycobacterium avium complex (18%), Pneumocystis pneumonia (10%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7%). The proportion of non-AIDS related deaths increased from 7% pre-HAART to 32% in the current HAART era. Accidental deaths, including drug overdose (29%), suicide (7%) and violence (3%), hepatic disease (19%), non-AIDS related malignancies (19%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) accounted for the majority of non-AIDS related deaths. No deaths directly caused by drug toxicity were found. Overall, 21% of patients who died were antiretroviral (ARV)-naive. A total of 14% of patients dying from AIDS were ARV-naive in contrast to 35% dying from non-HIV related conditions. Of all those dying from AIDS, 23% died&lt;3 months after their initial diagnosis, reflecting late presentation. In the current HAART era, 87% of patients who died from AIDS were extensively treated, reflecting HAART treatment failures due mostly to multiclass drug resistance (42%), inexorable disease progression despite ARV (32%), lack of ability or interest to be maintained on a lifelong HAART programme (21%) and, rarely, drug intolerance (&lt;1%). CONCLUSIONS: Deaths from AIDS-related causes have decreased significantly, but deaths from non-AIDS related conditions have increased, both as an absolute number of deaths and as a proportion of all deaths in HIV-infected patients. The increasing age of the HIV population, and the increased mean CD4 count, increased proportion of intravenous drug users, increased hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus coinfection rate, and increased history of smoking seen in our population also influenced the mortality rate and causes of death. These factors must also be considered in projecting future trends in mortality of an HIV-infected population."

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether demographic disparities in use of OI prophylaxis persist in 2001 and if outpatient care is associated with OI prophylaxis utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN: Demographic, clinical, and pharmacy utilization data were collected from 10 U.S. HIV primary care sites in the HIV Research Network. SUBJECTS: This study consisted of adult patients (&gt;or=18 years old) in longitudinal HIV primary care. MEASURES: Indications for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis were 2 or more CD4 counts less than 200 or 50 cells/mm(3) during calendar year (CY) 2001, respectively. Using multivariate logistic regression, we examined demographic and clinical characteristics associated with receipt of PCP or MAC prophylaxis and the association of outpatient utilization with appropriate OI prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 88.1% received PCP prophylaxis and 87.6% received MAC prophylaxis. Approximately 80% had 4 or more outpatient visits during CY 2001. Adjusting for care site, male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.47), Medicare coverage (OR, 1.60), and having 4 or more outpatient visits in a year (OR, 2.34) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of PCP prophylaxis. Adjusting for care site, having 4 or more outpatient visits in a year (OR, 1.85) was associated with increased likelihood of receipt of MAC prophylaxis. There were no demographic or insurance characteristics associated with receipt of MAC prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of OI prophylaxis has increased since the mid-1990s, and previous racial and HIV risk factor disparities in receipt of OI prophylaxis have waned.

METHODS: Hospital discharge diagnoses were established for 521 HIV-positive patients. RESULTS: Respiratory disease accounted for 49% of the admissions. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) was the main cause of respiratory disease (52%) followed by Pneumocystis carinii (PCP, 24%), non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM, 11%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, 9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease was established using bacteriological, clinical and radiographic criteria. NTM disease was defined following the American Thoracic Society criteria. NTM was disseminated in the majority of cases (19 Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), one Mycobacterium kansasii). Nine patients had respiratory disease (seven MAC, one Mycobacterium fortuitum, one Mycobacterium kansasii) and one had gastrointestinal disease caused by MAC. Mortality was 10% for NTM disseminated cases; none of the TB patients died over the course of the study. The length of hospitalization for NTM patients was longer (15+/-13 days) than for other respiratory cases (10+/-10, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: NTM disease along with its related mortality is a significant pathology as a cause of hospitalization among HIV-infected individuals."

To make a differential diagnosis between bacterial pneumonia, pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens, and mycobacterial infections, it is very important to analyze the radiological findings of inflammatory lung diseases based on normal antomical structures. If clinicoradiological anlyses could make these differentiations, the appropriate treatment strategy for respiratory infections could be established. To accomplish this, exact orientations of pulmonary lobulus, acinus, and respiratory bronchioles is very important. Then, through analyzing chest CT findings and distribution patterns based on normal anatomical structures, estimation of causative pathogens could be possible. Especially, whether inflammatory exudates could pass Kohn's pores as well as Lambert's channel or not is very important factor to affect radiological findings of several pneumonia (as traditionally called ""segmental"" and ""nonsegmental"" distribution). To differentiate infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis from nontuberculous mycobacteria, several important criteria have been demonstrated. Briefly, it has been suggested that Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) respiratory infection is increasing especially in elderly women without underlying diseases. In MAC respiratory infection, right middle lobe and left lingula are frequently involved and centrilobular nodules and diffuse bronchiectases are characteristic radiological findings. Finally, the role of telithromycin in the treatment of respiratory infections is discussed."

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 51 patients over a 15-yr period with clarithromycin-resistant MAC (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)&gt;or=32 microg/ml) lung disease at a single referral center. Twenty-four (47%) patients had nodular disease with bronchiectasis and 27 (53%) had upper lobe cavitary disease. Most patients (77%) had M. intracellulare. Sequencing of the 23S r-RNA gene showed 49 of 51 isolates (96%) with the expected mutation in adenine 2058 or 2059. Risk factors for resistance included macrolide monotherapy or combination with a quinolone only (39/51 or 76%). Macrolide resistance developed in 12 of 303 (4.0%) patients started on the American Thoracic Society-recommended two companion drugs, with no risk difference in clarithromycin versus azithromycin and daily versus intermittent therapy. Sputum conversion with macrolide-resistant MAC occurred in 11 of 14 (79%) patients who received more than 6 mo of injectable aminoglycoside therapy and lung resection, compared with 2 of 37 (5%) who did not.

CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide resistance rarely occurs in patients also receiving ethambutol and a rifamycin. Macrolide-resistant MAC lung disease requires aggressive drug and surgical therapy for cure."

We report a very rare case of M. intracellulare pulmonary disease with pleural empyema. A 56-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of fever, purulent sputum and pleuritic chest pain. A chest radiograph and CT revealed pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe and loculated hydropneumothorax. The sputum smear was positive for acid fast bacilli. The aspirated pleural fluid was grossly purulent and the smear of the pleural effusion was also positive for acid fast bacilli. M. intracellulare was identified by culture and PCR from sputum and pleural fluid specimens. The patient improved with percutaneous tube drainage of the purulent effusion and antibiotic treatment including clarithromycin, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin."

Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAC) causes most lung infections due to NTM. Patients with preexisting lung disease or immunodeficiency are at greatest risk for developing MAC infection. The majority of MAC pulmonary cases, however, occur in immunocompetent elderly women in association with nodular infiltrates and bronchiectasis. More recently, pulmonary disease has also been described in immunocompetent patients after exposure to MAC-contaminated hot tubs. We describe a case of aggressive MAC lung disease in a young immunocompetent female patient without preexisting lung disease whose clinical and pathologic characteristics do not fit into any of these categories and may represent a unique manifestation of MAC lung disease."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chart review was performed to identify all patients with a histologic diagnosis of granulomatous pneumonitis and positive cultures for MAC between January 1, 1995, and July 1, 2004. Individuals identified who also had a hot tub were included in the study. Twelve patients, seven females and five males with an average age of 50 years (range, 13-66 years), who had a CT scan were identified. The CT images were reviewed by two thoracic radiologists who assessed the images for the presence of any parenchymal abnormalities, including nodules, areas of ground-glass attenuation, reticular opacities, and air trapping, on expiratory images. When nodules, reticular opacities, areas of ground-glass attenuation, or a combination of these findings was present, the reviewers visually determined the extent of involvement of the lungs using a scale of &lt; 10%, 10-40%, or &gt; 40%. They also recorded the distribution of the involvement both cephalocaudal and transaxial. Decisions were reached by consensus of the reviewers. RESULTS: Nodules were present in 10 (83%) of 12 patients. In eight (80%) of 10 patients, the nodules were diffuse with a centrilobular distribution. In the other two, the nodules were randomly distributed with an upper lung predominance. In five patients the nodules showed areas of ground-glass attenuation, whereas in the other five the nodules were solid. Areas of ground-glass attenuation were present in eight (75%) of 12 patients and were bilateral in all cases. The areas of ground-glass attenuation were diffuse in the cephalocaudal plane with a random distribution in the transaxial plane in seven (88%) of eight cases. In the remaining case, the areas of ground-glass attenuation had a lower lung predominance with a random distribution in the transaxial plane. Expiratory images showed evidence of air trapping in all seven cases for which these images were available. In one patient, air trapping was the only abnormality identified. CONCLUSION: The CT findings in patients with hot tub lung include areas of ground-glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and air trapping on expiratory images. These findings are similar to previously published findings of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Therefore, in cases in which CT findings suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hot tub lung should also be a diagnostic consideration."

METHOD: In 2004 each of NZ's mycobacterium reference laboratories collected data on NTM isolates. The clinical significance of isolates was decided by contacting the requesting clinician. American Thoracic Society criteria were used to assign clinical significance to respiratory isolates. RESULTS: 368 patients had NTM isolated from various sites. 21% (78/368) were clinically significant [15% (47/316) of respiratory isolates, 100% (17/17) lymph node and 89% (8/9) of soft tissue isolates]. Of the significant isolates, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAIC) was the most common, accounting for 83%, 88%, and 44% of respiratory, lymph node, and soft tissue infections respectively. Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were the second most common cause of significant infection. Of 47 patients with significant respiratory isolates 79% were female and 83% had underlying lung disease. The incidence of disease caused by NTM in NZ in 2004 was 1.92/100,000 population. The specific incidence of pulmonary, lymph node and soft tissue infections was 1.17, 0.39, and 0.24 per 100,000 population respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM respiratory disease in NZ during 2004 is approximately twice that recorded for Australia in 2000 (0.56/100,000). MAIC is the most common pathogen, followed by RGM. Both organisms most commonly cause respiratory infections in elderly female patients with underlying lung disease."

The mean age at the onset of RA and the duration of RA was 57.2 +/- 15.2 years and 10.9 +/- 11.5 years, respectively. Pulmonary infections included nontuberculous mycobacteriosis in 59 patients (Mycobacterium avium complex infection, 50 cases : Mycobacterium kansasii infection, 4 cases; others, 5 cases), pneumonia in 46 patients, pulmonary tuberculosis in 28 patients, pulmonary aspergillosis in 12 patients, pulmonary cryptococcosis in 5 patients, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in 5 patients, lung abscess in 9 patients, exacerbation of bronchiectasis in 7 patients, and empyema in 4 patients. One hundred percent of patients with exacerbation of bronchiectasis, 91.7% of patients with pulmonary aspergillosis, 87% of patients with pneumonia, and 81.4% of patients with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis had underlying lung diseases. The pulmonary infections during therapy with steroids were pulmonary tuberculosis (78.6%), pneumonia (65.2%), and pulmonary aspergillosis (58.3%), while the pulmonary infections during methotrexate treatment were Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (80%), pulmonary cryptococcosis (40%), and pulmonary tuberculosis (28.6%). Pulmonary infections in RA patients who were taking TNFalpha inhibitors included 1 patient each with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Among the RA patients with lung abscess, malignancy was noted in 55.6%, and diabetes mellitus in 22.2%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second-most-common cause of pneumonia and cause of all exacerbations of bronchiectasis. As well as immunosuppressive medications (steroids, methotrexate, TNFalpha inhibitors) and systemic comorbid diseases, underlying lung diseases could be one of the risk factor for pulmonary infections in patients with RA. The dominant risk factor for each pulmonary infection in patients with RA might be different."

A chest x-ray showed interstitial infiltration over bilateral lung fields. A kidney biopsy showed immune complex-mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis and diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity with exudative neutrophils. Reactive NTM infection of the lungs was suspected when mycobacterial cultures of the sputum repeatedly yielded Mycobacterium avium. A lung biopsy revealed chronic inflammation without evidence of alveolar capillaritis. NTM pulmonary disease was further confirmed by tissue culture of the lung biopsy specimens. Anti-tuberculous drugs in combination with clarithromycin were given for the treatment of NTM infection. Because of the risk of aggravating underlying infectious disease, immunosuppressive therapy for crescentic glomerulonephritis was not carried out. Pulmonary symptoms promptly responded to treatment. Furthermore, renal function steadily improved after the initiation of anti-NTM therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with NTM infection."

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the morphotype, immunophenotype, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genotype in a large cohort with PNTM. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 63 patients with PNTM infection, each of whom had computerized tomography, echocardiogram, pulmonary function, and flow cytometry of peripheral blood. In vitro cytokine production in response to mitogen, LPS, and cytokines was performed. Anthropometric measurements were compared with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) age- and ethnicity-matched female control subjects extracted from the NHANES 2001-2002 dataset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 59.9 (+/-9.8 yr [SD]) old, and 5.4 (+/-7.9 yr) from diagnosis to enrollment. Patients were 95% female, 91% white, and 68% lifetime nonsmokers. A total of 46 were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex, M. xenopi, or M. kansasii; 17 were infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria. Female patients were significantly taller (164.7 vs. 161.0 cm; P &lt; 0.001) and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 28.2; P &lt; 0.001) than matched NHANES control subjects, and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 26.8; P = 0.002) than patients with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. A total of 51% of patients had scoliosis, 11% pectus excavatum, and 9% mitral valve prolapse, all significantly more than reference populations. Stimulated cytokine production was similar to that of healthy control subjects, including the IFN-gamma/IL-12 pathway. CD4(+), CD8(+), B, and natural killer cell numbers were normal. A total of 36% of patients had mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNTM infection are taller and leaner than control subjects, with high rates of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations, but without recognized immune defects."

However, NTM are a heterogeneous group and most of the data come from only three species: Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus. Still, information about these three species is confusing because it is based mainly on retrospective studies and series of clinical cases performed in developed countries. In recent years, new information has appeared about other species and the pathogenesis of NTM. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that NTM infection is a worldwide phenomenon with an increasing presence in developing countries perhaps because of the implementation of tap water. Women with characteristic phenotype are at higher risk of acquiring NTM infection along with patients with defects on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. New studies on Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium szulgai and Mycobacterium simiae indicate that the American Thoracic Society criteria for diagnosing NTM disease may not be useful for all species of NTM. SUMMARY: New multicentric and prospective studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of NTM. These organisms form a numerous and heterogeneous group and each species should be studied separately."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study (2001-2008) including all patients who met American Thoracic Society criteria for M. abscessus pulmonary disease. Our aim was the evaluation of clinical and microbiologic outcomes in patients treated with combined antibiotic and surgical therapy, compared with antibiotic therapy alone. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in the analysis. Patients were predominantly female (83%) and never-smokers (60%), with a mean age of 60 years. Fifty-nine (55%) of 107 patients had coexistent or previous history of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary infection. High-resolution chest CT showed bronchiectasis and nodular opacities in 98% of patients and cavities in 44%. Sixty-nine (46 medical, 23 surgical) patients were followed up for a mean duration of 34 months (standard deviation, 21.1 months, range, 2-82 months). Cough, sputum production, and fatigue remained stable, improved, or resolved in 80%, 69%, and 59% of patients, respectively. Twenty (29%) of 69 patients remained culture positive, 16 (23%) converted but experienced relapse, 33 (48%) converted to negative and did not experience relapse, and 17 (16%) died during the study period. There were significantly more surgical patients than medical patients whose culture converted and remained negative for at least 1 year (57% vs 28%; P = .022).

During the study period, 50 patients with hematological malignancy and tuberculosis (TB) were also evaluated. Among 2,846 patients with hematological malignancy, 34 (1.2%) patients had NTM infections. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (13 patients, 38%) was the most commonly isolated species, followed by M. abscessus (21%), M. fortuitum (18%), and M. kansasii (18%).

However, there is uncertainty regarding the association between long-term use of ICS and exacerbations of respiratory tract infections among asthmatic patients. METHODS: A case-control nested cohort study was performed to assess the association of asthma with nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infection.

METHODS: We examined patients in the University of Washington Human Immunodeficiency Virus Cohort initiating potent ART subsequent to an AIDS-defining OI. IRIS was determined through retrospective medical record review and adjudication using a standardized data collection process and clinical case definition. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics, and immunologic changes in patients with and without IRIS.

Exacerbation of infectious pneumonitis and interstitial pneumonia required complementary inpatient treatment in August 2007. Although polymerase chain reaction examination of expectorated sputa revealed the absence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. intracellulare on admission, nontuberculous M. abscessus was detected in the routine blood cultures. Taken together with clinical findings, M. abscessus was most likely the primary causative organism. Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be highly helpful for diagnosis."

NTM are ubiquitous environmental pathogens with high isolation rates worldwide. The greater frequency of NTM associated with pulmonary diseases is probably due to a combination of increased exposure, improved diagnostic methods and an increase in the prevalence of risk factors predisposing individuals to infection. Difficulty may arise in determining whether an isolate from a respiratory sample is in fact a contaminant or a pathogenic organism. The ATS/IDSA guidelines highlight the importance of following microbiological and clinical criteria in making a diagnosis of NTM lung infection. These criteria may not be useful for all NTM and species-level identification is strongly recommended. Mycobacteria identification by conventional methods has been the standard in most clinical microbiology laboratories. However, conventional testing alone does not allow identification of many NTM. Newer, rapid molecular methods such as commercially available nucleic acid probes, genomic amplification and DNA sequence analysis should be used. Communication between the clinician and the laboratorian is essential to decide whether an isolate could be sent to a reference laboratory to determine the best method for species identification. Although the CLSI has recently published an approved standard for NTM susceptibility testing, there is ongoing debate about the role of in vitro susceptibility for managing patients with NTM disease. The goal of this review is to describe the mycobacteria involved in lung disease, the factors that predispose to this infection, its diagnosis with alternative procedures and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response."

Peak serum concentrations (C(max)) below target range were frequent for ethambutol (48% of patients); clarithromycin (56%); and azithromycin (35%). Concurrent administration of rifampicin led to 68%, 23%, and 10% decreases in C(max) of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin.

CONCLUSIONS: Currently recommended regimens for MAC lung disease yield important pharmacologic interactions and low concentrations of key drugs including macrolides. Pharmacodynamic indices for rifampicin, clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin are seldom met. This may partly explain the poor outcomes of currently recommended treatment regimens. Trials of new drugs and new dosing strategies are needed."

Among these are non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), with Mycobacterium avium complex being the most commonly described finding. Antimycobacterial treatment of NTM in cases of IRIS is controversial. We report the case of a 39-year-old man diagnosed with HIV-1 infection during admission to hospital with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and a CD4 cell count of 60/mul. The patient started antiretroviral treatment and made an uneventful recovery from the PCP diagnosis, but was readmitted after 2.5 months with a purulent infrapatellar bursitis on the left knee. A surgical procedure was performed and Mycobacterium malmoense was grown from the pus from the bursa. The patient recovered without supplemental antimycobacterial treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report on IRIS caused by M malmoense."

CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 62 year old white female with pseudallescheria boydii pneumonia. The patient was non-immunocompromised, had a history of mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection prior to presentation. After successful response to initial antitubercular therapy, the patient developed recurrent symptoms and bibasilar nodular infiltrates. Second line therapy for MAC failed to improve symptomatology. Pseudallescheria boydii pneumonia was diagnosed from a bronchoscopic biopsy. Treatment with voriconazole resolved her symptomatology and radiological infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for superimposed fungal infections in patients who are refractory to medical treatment of bacterial pneumonitis such as MAC. Further diagnostic interventions are encouraged when insufficient clinical improvement is observed. Prompt initiation of an antifungal regimen is warranted."

It results from restored immunity to specific infectious or non-infectious antigens. We describe the case of a 47-year-old female patient who presented with an unspecific painful pressure in the abdomen and weight loss that was diagnosed as intra-abdominal (unmasking) IRIS due to nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (Mycobacterium avium complex). Antiretroviral therapy had been initiated six months earlier when pneumocystis pneumonia led to the diagnosis of HIV infection with a viral load of 123 000 copies/ml and a CD 4 cell count of 6/microl. Although IRIS is a known complication after initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients this case with a rare site of manifestation and symptoms that are common in all day gastroenterological clinic highlights a differential diagnosis that requires a high index of suspicion and the need for the careful use of diagnostic tools.

This study examined household water and shower aerosols of patients with NTM pulmonary disease. The mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples from 20 patients included M. avium (5 patients), M. intracellulare (12 patients), M. abscessus (7 patients), M. gordonae (1 patient), M. lentiflavum (1 patient), M. fortuitum (1 patient), M. peregrinum (1 patient), M. chelonae (1 patient), M. triplex (1 patient), and M. kansasii (1 patient). One-liter water samples and swabs were collected from all taps, and swimming pools or rainwater tanks. Shower aerosols were sampled using Andersen six-stage cascade impactors. For a subgroup of patients, real-time PCR was performed and high-resolution melt profiles were compared to those of ATCC control strains. Pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from 19 homes. Species identified in the home matched that found in the patient in seven (35%) cases: M. abscessus (3 cases), M. avium (1 case), M. gordonae (1 case), M. lentiflavum (1 case), and M. kansasii (1 case). In an additional patient with M. abscessus infection, this species was isolated from potable water supplying her home. NTM grown from aerosols included M. abscessus (3 homes), M. gordonae (2 homes), M. kansasii (1 home), M. fortuitum complex (4 homes), M. mucogenicum (1 home), and M. wolinskyi (1 home). NTM causing human disease can be isolated from household water and aerosols. The evidence appears strongest for M. avium, M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, and M. abscessus. Despite a predominance of disease due to M. intracellulare, we found no evidence for acquisition of infection from household water for this species. "

Natural course on serial computed tomographic scans.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: Existing literature is inconclusive regarding how the nodular bronchiectatic form of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease will progress without treatment and when treatment initiation should be considered. OBJECTIVES: To assess the natural course of MAC pulmonary disease by serial thin-section computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Of 339 patients with nodular bronchiectatic form of MAC disease, we selected 265 untreated patients who had serial CTs (mean observation period, 32 +- 21 mo). Two independent chest radiologists reviewed retrospectively all CT scans for the presence and extent of lung abnormalities (maximal total score, 30). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 265 patients, 126 patients (48%) had disease that had progressed and that needed treatment owing to radiologic deterioration or worsening symptoms, and the remaining 139 patients (52%) did not. On multivariate analysis, the presence of cavity (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.06; P = 0.004) and consolidation (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; P = 0.019) at initial CT remained as independent factors associated with disease progression and treatment requirement. The presence of cavitary lesions demonstrated the highest positive predictive value (61%) and significant correlation (P = 0.005) with smear positivity. Differences in the extent of each pattern and total CT score in the serial studies were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.05) in patients requiring treatment. The total CT score increased by 2.41 in the treatment-requiring group compared with 0.25 in the group that did not receive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Without treatment, about half of patients demonstrate progressive disease on serial CT over a mean follow-up period of 32 months and, thus, required treatment. Patients showing cavities or consolidation on initial CT are more likely to have progressive disease and thus to require treatment eventually."

The objective for this study is to elucidate the prevalence and spectrums of OIs and malignancies in HIV-infected patients in the Beijing Ditan Hospital. METHODS: The evaluation of the prevalence and spectrums of OIs and malignancies was conducted by using the clinical data of 834 HIV-infected patients admitted in the Beijing Ditan hospital from January 1, 2009, to November 30, 2012. RESULTS: The prevalence and spectrums of OIs and malignancies varied contingent on geographic region, transmission routes, and CD4 levels. We found that tuberculosis was most common OI and prevalence was 32.5%, followed by candidiasis(29.3%), Pneumocystis pneumonia(PCP)(22.4%), cytomegalovirus(CMV) infection(21.7%), other fungal infections(16.2%), mycobacterium avium complex(MAC)(11.3%), cryptococcosis(8.0%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy(PML)(4.4%), Cerebral Toxoplasmosis(3.5%) and Penicillium marneffei infection(1.4%); while Lymphoma(2.9%), Kaposi's sarcoma(0.8%) and cervix carcinoma(0.3%) were emerged as common AIDS-defining malignancies. Pulmonary OI infections were the most prevalent morbidity and mortality in patients in the AIDS stage including pulmonary tuberculosis (26.6%) and PCP (22.4%). CMV infection(21.7%) was most common viral infection; Fungal OIs were one of most prevalent morbidity in patients in the AIDS stage, including oral candidiasis (29.3%), other fungal infection (16.2%), Cryptococcosis (8.0%) and Penicillium marneffei infection (1.4%). We found the low prevalence of AIDS-defining illnesses in central neural system in this study, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (4.4%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (3.5%), tuberculosis meningitis (3.2%), cryptococcal meningitis (2.4%) and CMV encephalitis (1.1%). In-hospital mortality rate was 4.3 per 100 person-years due to severe OIs, malignancies, and medical cost constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and spectrums of OIs, malignancies and co-infections were discussed in this study.

METHODS: We retrospectively selected 220 patients who satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NTM disease proposed by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Nine patients with pulmonary NTM disease were complicated with pneumothorax. We investigated the patients' background, laboratory findings, radiological findings, treatment and prognoses. RESULTS: There were nine patients, including six men and three women, with a mean age of 73.2 years. Seven patients had underlying respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) excluding pulmonary NTM disease. The causative microorganisms was Mycobacterium avium in four patients, M. intracellulare in four patients, and M. kansasii in one patient. Regarding the radiological findings, pneumothorax was recognized in the right lung in five patients, in the left lung in three patients, and in both lungs heterogeneously in one patient. Although most patients exhibited multiple cavities and extensive lesions over the unilateral lung fields, three patients were simultaneously diagnosed with pulmonary NTM disease at the onset of pneumothorax. As for treatment, thoracic drainage was performed in seven patients, while one patient was advised only to rest and one patient required both thoracic drainage and surgery. The responses to the treatment was poor in each case, and five patients died due to pneumonia or heart failure. CONCLUSION: In this study, the rate of pneumothorax complications in the patients with pulmonary NTM disease (4.1%) was higher than that of other reports. The responses to treatment, and prognoses were poor due to the presence of other complications."

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL &lt;0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration."

To elucidate clinicopathological features of these rare cases, we examined PAS cases determined by histological examination of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) specimens. METHODS: Of 6105 TBLB cases investigated from 1990 to 2007, 11 were diagnosed as PAS based on histology. Of these, we examined 9 records in detail, as the medical records for 2 cases were unavailable. RESULTS: Histopathological findings indicated 8 patients with aspiration pneumonia and 1 with diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis. However, the pre-bronchoscopy diagnoses included lung cancer, mycobacteriosis, organizing pneumonia, repetitive pneumonia, fungal infection, and interstitial pneumonia. PAS was not considered before TBLB. Only 4 of the 9 patients developed subjective symptoms including fever and cough with sputum production. Laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of white blood cell (WBC) count in only 1 patient and elevation of C reactive protein (CRP) level in 4 patients. Radiographic examination revealed abnormal findings in the dorsal right lower lobes, which was the most vulnerable site for aspiration pneumonia, and also in the upper and ventral portions of the lung. Although the characteristic findings of PAS were scarce, all patients had conditions predisposing to aspiration; i.e., gastrectomy, excessive alcohol drinking, post-cerebral infarction, and sinobronchial syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: We diagnosed 9 PAS patients on the basis of histological findings that were distinct from clinical findings. Despite presenting with variable symptoms and laboratory and radiographic findings, they all exhibited predisposing factors to aspiration."

METHODS: We used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan in this study. The NTM cohort contained 3,005 patients, and each case was randomly frequency matched by age, sex, income, occupation, and index year with four people from the general population without NTM infections. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of COPD in the NTM cohort compared with the non-NTM cohort. RESULTS: The incidence of COPD was 3.08-fold higher (21.75 vs. 6.11 per 1,000 person-years) in the NTM cohort than in the non-NTM cohort. The aHR of COPD comparing the NTM cohort with the non-NTM cohort was 3.57 (95 % CI 2.56-4.97) for women and 2.89 (95 % CI 2.31-3.61) for men. The aHR of COPD was higher in the patients with NTM infection and a comorbidity such as bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, diabetes, asthma, and heart disease. The Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex group (MAC) and the non-MAC group were isolated in the NTM cohort. The MAC group had a higher aHR of COPD than the non-NTM cohort (aHR = 3.72, 95 % CI 2.94-4.72).

Unlike tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is not communicable. However, their indolent nature may result in extensive parenchymal destruction, causing respiratory failure and vulnerability to airway infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, therefore, has been becoming a significant health problem. According to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement on nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, the primary treatment is a multidrug treatment regimen. However, its efficacy is less than satisfactory for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, which is the most common type of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, and for Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease, which is notoriously resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The statement, therefore, has proposed a multidisciplinary treatment approach for these types of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases: a combination of multidrug treatment regimen and adjuvant resectional surgery. This review covers the rationale, indication, procedure, and outcome of surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. The rationale of surgery is to prevent disease progressing by removing the areas of lung most affected, harboring the largest amounts of mycobacteria. The indications for surgery include a poor response to drug therapy, the development of macrolide-resistant disease, or the presence of a significant disease-related complication such as hemoptysis. The surgical procedures of choice are various types of pulmonary resections, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. The reported series have achieved favorable treatment outcomes in surgically treated patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. "

METHODS: A retrospective review of the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens from January 2007 to May 2013. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were identified with at least one respiratory NTM isolate and 56 patients (46%) fulfilled the microbiological ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. Of patients with adequate data, 16% fulfilled the complete ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. The incidence of pulmonary NTM infection and disease was 18.9 and 8.8 per 100.000 inpatients and outpatients, respectively. The spectrum of NTM species was high (13 species) and predominated by M. avium-intracellulare complex (M. avium (13%), M. intracellulare (10%)), M. gordonae (14%), and M. fortuitum (12%). The ratio of isolation of NTM to M. tuberculosis in all hospitalized patients was 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: The first data on the epidemiology of pulmonary NTM in Athens, Greece, are presented.

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

We investigated the characteristics and clinical impact of NTM isolation in this population. Medical records of adult patients who underwent SCT at the blood and marrow transplantation center at a University Hospital in South Korea between January 2004 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five of 2,658 patients were enrolled, an incidence of 0.94%. The most common NTM species isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 15) and Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 5). Sixteen patients were co-infected with other pathogens, including Aspergillus species (10 cases). Nonspecific pneumonia and cavitary pneumonia were the most common radiologic patterns. Sixteen patients had underlying lung graft-versus-host disease, including bronchiolitis obliterans (10 cases) with moderate obstructive lung defects. Whereas two of 10 patients who were treated for NTM died as a result of NTM progression, one of 15 patients who were not treated died of the same cause. This study shows that the incidence of respiratory NTM detection in SCT recipients was low and its virulence was not higher than expected. As patients frequently had concomitant infections and underlying lung diseases that made radiologic evaluation more difficult, we suggest that it would be advantageous to perform repeated microbiologic studies when NTM infection is clinically suspected."

In total, 452 nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains isolated from patients with NTM lung diseases in four specialised TB hospitals were enrolled in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to evaluate the drug susceptibility of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM lung diseases caused by M. avium and M. intracellulare were analysed. Of 452 NTM isolates, M. intracellulare (188; 41.6%) was the most frequently isolated organism. The percentages of moxifloxacin- and linezolid-resistant strains among the M. intracellulare isolates were significantly lower than those among the M. avium group (P=0.003 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, M. avium harboured a lower proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains than M. intracellulare (P=0.005). Among patients with M. intracellulare lung diseases, the percentages of patients aged &gt;64 years and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significantly higher than among patients with M. avium (P=0.008 for age and P=0.001 for COPD). In conclusion, these data demonstrated that M. intracellulare was the most common NTM species in China. This study also revealed that M. intracellulare and M. avium differed in their drug susceptibility profiles. In addition, clinical cases of M. intracellulare lung diseases were more likely to be found in the aged population and among patients with COPD co-morbidity. "

Most previous studies focused mainly on tuberculosis (TB) rather than NTM infections. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical features of mycobacterial infections, from both MTB and NTM in HIV-infected patients in Siriraj Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study of adult HIV-infected patients in Infectious Disease Clinic, Siriraj Hospital, was conducted. Clinical characteristics and factors associated with mycobacterial infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 253 patients enrolled, 65 (25.7%) developed mycobacterial infections, in which 56 patients (86%) were tuberculosis (TB), whereas NTM was diagnosed in 9 (14%). Of these 65 patients, 45 (69.2%) were culture-proven, 14 (21.6%) were diagnosed TB by positive acid-fast bacilli smears and 6 (9.2%) were diagnosed TB by clinical response to anti-tuberculosis treatment only. Among culture-positive patients, MTB was found in 36 (80%) and NTM in 9 (20%), in which Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the most common among NTMisolates (n = 5),followed by unidentifiable slowly-growing mycobacteria (n = 3) and M. fortuitum (n = 1). Among patients with MTB infection, 58.3% were disseminated. The most affected organ in patients with mycobacterial infections was lung (75%), followed by lymph node (66.7%). Factors associated with mycobacterial infections included male gender (64.6% vs. 54.3%; p = 0.026), higher HIV Viral load (1.04 x 10(6) VS. 0.3 x 10(6); p = 0.004), lower hematocrit (32.7% vs. 35.3%; p = 0.032) and higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (146 U/L vs. 107 U/L;p = 0.032). In contrast, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) was negatively associated with mycobacterial infections in HIV-infected individuals (28.8% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.004). Favorable treatment response was 86.1% and 77.8% for MTB and NTM infection, respectively, and the 6-month mortality rates were 2.78% and 11.1% for MTB and NTM infection, respectively. In patients who received treatment for TB, 22.2% had hepatitis, 13.9% had drug allergy and 8.3% had immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. CONCLUSION: Disseminated infection is the most common form of mycobacterial infection in HIV-infected patients, resulting in anemia and high ALP levels. PCP was negatively associated with mycobacterial infection. MAC is the most common of the NTM isolates in HIV-infected patients."

We present the first case of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-associated IRIS (MAC-IRIS) that was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old homosexual Japanese man was referred to our hospital with fever and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and found to be HIV positive. After the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the patient's mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy gradually enlarged, and bilateral infiltrates appeared in the upper lung fields. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed five months after the initiation of cART and showed intense accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) corresponding to the lesions of infiltration as well as the mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. A bronchial wash culture and pathology findings led to a diagnosis of MAC-IRIS. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy with rifampicin, ethambutol, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin was started. One year after the chemotherapy was initiated, there was a significant reduction in FDG uptake in the area of the lesions except in the mediastinal lymph node. This implied incomplete resolution of the MAC-IRIS-related inflammation. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy was continued because of the residual lesion. To date, the patient has not experienced a recurrence of MAC-IRIS, a period of nine months. CONCLUSION: We present a case of MAC-IRIS in an HIV-infected patient whose disease activity was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our data suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for evaluating the disease activity of NTM-IRIS and assessing the appropriate duration of anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy for NTM-IRIS in HIV-infected patients."

Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility. METHODS: Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria. RESULTS: Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

Opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other conditions develop progressively over time, particularly in untreated patients. The AIDS-defining opportunistic infections most common in the United States include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Candida esophagitis, toxoplasmic encephalitis, tuberculosis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococcal meningitis, and cytomegalovirus retinitis. Specific prophylaxis regimens exist for several opportunistic infections, and effective antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of most others. Other AIDS-defining conditions include wasting syndrome and HIV encephalopathy. AIDS-defining malignancies include Kaposi sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer. Although not an AIDS-defining condition, anal cancer is common in patients with HIV infection. Other HIV-related conditions include thrombocytopenia, recurrent bacterial respiratory infections, HIV-associated nephropathy, and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. "

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients with ABPM focusing on the frequency of pNTM and cLRTIs, acute exacerbation of cLRTIs, and pneumonia. Results During a median follow-up period of 2,299 days (range, 118-6,138 days), 7 patients developed pNTM (mainly Mycobacterium avium complex), and 21 patients developed cLRTI (mostly from Staphylococcus aureus followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Twelve patients developed 21 episodes of acute exacerbation of cLRTIs, and 4 patients developed pneumonia. Conclusion Patients with ABPM can have concomitant NTM infection and, not uncommonly, cLRTI, and they can also sometimes develop pneumonia or an acute exacerbation of cLRTI. "

A common radiological feature in pulmonary MAC infection is a mixture of two basic patterns: fibrocavitary and nodular bronchiectatic; however, lobar consolidation is rare. We report an 83-year-old man with lobar caseous pneumonia caused by pulmonary MAC infection. Radiological findings were predominantly composed of dense lobar consolidation and ground-glass opacity. A diagnosis was made in accordance with the clinical and microbiological criteria set by the American Thoracic Society. A histological examination of lung specimens obtained by using a bronchoscope revealed a caseous granulomatous inflammation with an appearance of Langhans cells. The patient was treated using combined mycobacterium chemotherapy with an initial positive response for 6 months; however, the disease progressed later. We suggest that an awareness of lobar pneumonic consolidation as a rare radiological finding in pulmonary MAC infection is important. "

The development of molecular methods has allowed the characterization of new species and the identification of NTM to the precise species and subspecies levels. The incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease are increasing worldwide, and this syndrome accounts for the majority of clinical cases of NTM disease. Common causative organisms of pulmonary infection are the slowly growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium kansasii and the rapidly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex. NTM lung disease often affects elderly people with chronic lung disease and may be a manifestation of a complex genetic disorder determined by interactions among multiple genes, as well as environmental exposures. To be diagnosed with NTM lung disease, patients should meet all clinical and microbiologic criteria, but the decision to start treatment is complex, requiring careful individualized analysis of risks and benefits. Clinicians should be alert to the unique aspects of NTM lung disease, including the need for proper diagnosis, the availability of advanced molecular methods for species and subspecies identification, and the benefits and limitations of recommended treatments."

We hypothesized an association between pulmonary MAI infection and Th2-type immune responses as seen in allergy. METHODS: Biomarkers of patient Th2-type immune responses (peripheral blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE levels) were compared between patients with positive pulmonary samples for tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. A further comparison of clinical characteristics, including respiratory co-morbidities, and biomarkers, was conducted between patients culturing MAI NTM and those culturing NTM other than MAI. RESULTS: Patients culturing NTM from pulmonary samples had significantly higher peripheral blood eosinophil levels than those culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, patients culturing MAI compared to those culturing NTM other than MAI had higher eosinophil counts (mean 0.29x109/L vs 0.15x109/L, p = 0.010) and IgE levels (geometric mean 138kU/L vs 47kU/L, p = 0.021). However there was no significant difference in the frequency of asthma between the two NTM groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between biomarkers of Th2-type immune responses and pulmonary MAI. Prospective and translational research could identify the direction of causation; and so determine whether our finding may be utilized within future management strategies for MAI."

However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of PNTM-associated CPA. In the present investigation, we aimed to elucidate the clinical course and prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 62 patients with CPA and a history of PNTM who were admitted to Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center between 2010 and 2015. Co-morbidities, causative microorganisms, radiological findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 69.5 years, and the median follow-up period was 4.2 years. The major underlying diseases, other than PNTM and CPA, were old pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia. The most common causative NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC; 37 patients; 59.7%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (20 patients; 32.3%). Survival was 83% after 1 year and 61% after 5 years. Use of systemic corticosteroids (hazard ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-9.51; P=0.00177) and C-reactive protein levels &gt;= 5.0 mg/dL (hazard ratio: 8.96, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-62.9; P=0.0014) at the time of CPA diagnosis were associated with increased over-all mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CPA frequently developed in patients with MAC and M. kansasii PNTM. The treatment course of PNTM was not associated with all-cause mortality. However, systemic corticosteroid use and high CRP levels were negative prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. Since the prognosis is poor, early diagnosis and treatment of CPA are important in patients with PNTM."

In such cases, Occam's razor need not apply: multiple infections and malignancies are often present concurrently upon presentation to care. A patient off anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for several years developed advanced HIV infection (CD4 count 19 cells/uL) and presented with five simultaneous opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bloodstream infection, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia. Simultaneously, he was found to have primary central nervous system (CNS) B-cell lymphoma. Treatment decisions for such patients are often complex, as ideal therapy for one disease may directly counter or interact with therapy for another. For instance, methotrexate for primary CNS lymphoma and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for PJP is a strictly contraindicated medication combination. It is important to understand not just the management of any single opportunistic disease in patients with advanced HIV, but how to balance management for patients with a variety of concurrent processes.

OBJECTIVE: To show the outcomes of pulmonary resection and identify risk factors after adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD. METHODS: One hundred and eight patients underwent adjuvant lung resection for MAC-LD at two hospitals between January 2008 and July 2016. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes and risk factors. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (13%). After lung resection, 98 out of 108 patients (91%) achieved sputum culture conversion, eight (8.2%) of whom developed microbiological recurrence during the follow-up period. As a result, the success rate of adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD with drug resistance was 83%. A multivariable analysis showed that a longer period from the initial medical treatment to surgery (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.02; p = 0.008) was independently associated with an increased risk of unfavorable outcomes after adjuvant surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD have acceptable outcomes. Better control of the disease may be achieved in some patients with drug resistance and indications for surgery through surgical treatments, and pulmonary resection needs to be performed earlier rather than continuing chemotherapy in these patients because it reduces unfavorable outcomes."

Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common involved pathogen, followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (MABSC), while Mycobacterium kansasii is not a major concern. The rate of infection rate in lung transplant recipients is reported to range from 1.5-22.4%. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here four cases of NTM pulmonary infection and disease among 63 patients who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at our hospital. Those four occurred following living-donor transplantation in two patients, one with pulmonary arterial hypertension and one with bronchiectasia, and deceased donor lung transplantation in two patients, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and interstitial pneumonia, respectively. NTM was not detected in any of the patients prior to transplantation. The involved pathogens were Mycobacterium gordonae in one, MAC in one, and MABSC in two of these patients, which were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in two and sputum in two. The one case of MAC and two of MABSC were symptomatic with consolidation shown in chest CT images indicating possible pneumonia, while the one with M. gordonae had no symptoms and was detected by surveillance BAL. Onset time from detection of NTM was greater than 3 years in the three with MABSC and M. gordonae and less than 3 years in the one with MAC. Each patient required a decrease in immunosuppressive agents according to their condition, while antibiotics therapy was performed in the three who were symptomatic. Sputum culture findings became negative after several months and were maintained thereafter in all. CONCLUSION: An NTM infection leading to pulmonary disease can occur at any time following lung transplantation.

METHODS: Minocycline MICs for 55 MAC clinical isolates from the Netherlands were determined. We also co-incubated primary isolated macrophages infected with MAC with minocycline. Next, we performed a 28 day HFS-MAC model dose-response study in which we mimicked pulmonary concentration-time profiles achieved in patients. The HFS-MAC model was sampled at intervals to determine the minocycline pharmacokinetics and MAC burden. We identified the AUC0-24/MIC ratios associated with 1.0 log10 cfu/mL kill below day 0 (stasis), defined as a bactericidal effect. We then performed 10000 Monte Carlo experiments to identify the optimal dose for a bactericidal effect in patients. RESULTS: The MIC for 50% and 90% of cumulative clinical isolates was 8 and 64 mg/L, respectively. Minocycline decreased MAC bacterial burden below stasis in primary isolated macrophages. In the HFS-MAC model, minocycline achieved a microbial kill of 3.6 log10 cfu/mL below stasis. The AUC0-24/MIC exposure associated with a bactericidal effect was 59. Monte Carlo experiments identified a minocycline susceptibility MIC breakpoint of 16 mg/L. At this proposed breakpoint, the clinical dose of 200 mg/day achieved the bactericidal effect exposure target in ~50% of patients, while 400 mg/day achieved this in 73.6% of patients, in Monte Carlo experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline at a dose of 400 mg/day is expected to be bactericidal. We propose a clinical trial for validation."

Methods: We conducted a case-control study. Seventeen of 7013 patients with SARD fulfilling the criteria for pulmonary NTM infection were enrolled in the NTM group. The control group was matched for age, sex, and SARD at a ratio of 2:1. Results: Eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis, four with systemic vasculitis, three with Sjogren's syndrome, and one each with dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus were included in the NTM group. Mycobacterium avium was detected in 12 (71%) patients, M. chelonae in 2, and M. intracellulare, M. abscessus, and M. kansasii in 1 patient each. Preexisting lung disease was more common in the NTM group than in the control group (88% versus 38%, p = .0009), particularly bronchiectasis (65% versus 29%, p = .033). The body mass index and serum albumin level were significantly lower in the NTM group than in the control group. Six patients (35%) experienced NTM exacerbation during observation. Clinical immune status at the time of NTM diagnosis, as indicated by the peripheral blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and serum immunoglobulin G level, was unremarkable and comparable between patients with and without exacerbation, as were the treatments for SARD. Conclusions: In patients with SARD, pulmonary NTM infection may develop and exacerbate without clinically apparent immunosuppression."

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

NTM were identified in different clinical samples by microbiological culture and molecular-based methods. NTM were isolated from 14 patients, out of whom four (27%) were infected and were treated accordingly. Two were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), two with M. abscessus complex (MABSC) and one with M. intracellulare. Two patients had cystic fibrosis-related lung disease and improved after successful NTM eradication. One patient was HIV-positive and died. One patient had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-related pneumonia and is currently being followed-up. We conclude that NTM frequency in our center was low among pediatric patients. Whether this is inherent to Brazilian patients, due to the broad coverage of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine in Brazil, or a result of underdiagnosis remains to be elucidated."

In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

Accumulating data suggests higher rates of bronchiectasis among the HIV-positive population. This case series involves 14 patients with bronchiectasis and HIV followed at two major urban institutions from 1999 to 2018. Demographics, clinical presentation, microbiology, radiographic imaging, and outcomes were collected and compiled. Mean age was 42 years (range 12-77 years). 36% had a CD4 count greater than 500 cells/mm3, 28% had a CD4 count between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, and 36% had AIDS. 43% were treated for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and 50% for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. 21% had COPD, 7% had asthma, and 7% had a history of pulmonary aspergillosis. Two patients were followed up by pulmonary services after diagnosis of bronchiectasis on CT. The timeline of the follow-up in these cases was within months and after three years respectively. It is posited that the prevalence of bronchiectasis in HIV patients may be underestimated. Improving recognition and management of bronchiectasis could help diminish rehospitalization rates."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

The efficacy and safety of fluoroquinolone-containing combination regimens as an alternative remain uncertain. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of fluoroquinolone-containing regimens with those of the standard regimens for treating pulmonary MAC disease. METHODS: We retrospectively included consecutive MAC patients who were treated in our hospital between January 2011 and May 2019. Patients treated with fluoroquinolone-containing regimens who had relapsed after treatment with standard regimens were excluded. A propensity score analysis was conducted to reduce selection bias, and the proportions of clinical improvement, defined by chest imaging findings and sputum conversion, were compared between the fluoroquinolone-containing regimen and standard regimen groups. RESULTS: We analyzed 28 patients who received fluoroquinolone-containing regimens and 46 who received the standard regimen. Fluoroquinolone-containing regimens were more likely selected for patients with cavitary lesions, diabetes mellitus, culture negativity, a low daily physical activity level, a decreased lymphocyte count and an increased CRP level. The propensity score was calculated using these variables (C-statistic of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the propensity score: 0.807, p < 0.0001). The fluoroquinolone-containing regimens were significantly inferior to the standard regimen in clinical improvements (p = 0.002, Log-rank test) in the univariate analysis, but the significance was lost after adjusting for the propensity score (HR 0.553, 95% CI 0.285-1.074, p = 0.080). Six (21%) patients in the fluoroquinolone-containing regimen group and ten (22%) patients in the standard regimen group experienced low-grade adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in clinical improvement between these regimens after propensity score adjustment. A large-scale prospective study is required to validate these results."

However, for patients without initial treatment at diagnosis, the survival outcomes and predictors of mortality remain unclear. METHODS: From 2011 to 2017, MAC-LD patients at two medical centers in Taiwan were screened, and those who received MAC treatment at the initial were excluded. The clinical course and characteristics were recorded. Cox regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess risk factors of mortality within 4 years. RESULTS: We included 123 MAC-LD patients without initial MAC treatment. The mean follow-up period was 4.15 +- 2.52 years. Twenty-two (17.9%) patients died within four years. Multivariate analysis showed that four independent factors related to 4-year mortality were consolidation pattern (hazard ratio [HR] 6.0, 95% confidence interval [2.3-15.5]), radiographic score > 6 (HR:11.0 [4.0-31.1]), radiographic deterioration within two years (HR: 5.2 [2.1-13.1]) and no MAC treatment during follow up (HR: 6.5 [1.3-31.1]). The areas under the ROC curves for prediction of 4-year mortality for the combination of consolidation and radiographic score >6, the two factors plus radiographic progression, the two plus no MAC treatment, and the combination of the four factors were 0.702, 0.798, 0.758, and 0.835, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The four-year mortality rate in MAC-LD without initial treatment is high. Presence of consolidation pattern and radiographic score >6 at initial visit, radiographic deterioration and no treatment during follow-up were risk factors of 4-year mortality in initially untreated MAC-LD."

Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for viral detection were implemented to specimens (nasopharynx swab, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) obtained from all the patients, which was consistent with the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the status of immune function (immunocompromised group, n=26; immunocompetent group, n=44), and patients were divided into PIV infection group (n=43) and mixed infection group (n=27) according to whether there was mixed infection. Characteristics including age, gender, underlying diseases, symptoms, disease severity, imaging manifestations, etiology, respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drug, antimicrobial drug and 30-day mortality between the groups were compared, and the prognostic factors of PIV infections were investigated using Cox regression. Results: The peak incidence of PIV infection time was in May, August, September and December, accounting for 58.6% of all cases. The enrolled 70 cases included 43 cases with pneumonia, 16 cases with interstitial lung disease and infection, 7 cases with bronchiectasis and infection, and 4 cases with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Eight patients (11.4%) had no underlying diseases, 21 patients (30.0%) had respiratory failure, 18 patients (25.7%) were treated with mechanical ventilation, 15 patients (21.4%) died within 30 days after admission. The pneumonia severity index score, percentage of patients with ground-glass opacity according CT scan, with honeycomb or reticular pattern, with mechanical ventilation, with respiratory failure, with ICU admission, and 30-day mortality in immunocompromised group were higher than those of immunocompetent group [(91.5 vs 84.0), (60.0% vs 34.1%), (44.0% vs 11.4%), (42.3% vs 15.9%), (50.0% vs 18.2%), (38.5% vs 22.7%), (34.6% vs 13.6%)] (all P<0.05). There were 27 cases (38.6%) with mixed infection, including 17 viruses (24.3%), 19 bacteria (27.1%), 14 (20.0%) fungi (PCP, aspergillus) and 1 (1.4%) Mycobacterium intracellulare. Sixteen patients (59.3%) in the mixed infection group were immunocompromised patients and 21 patients (77.8%) had chronic lung disease. Cox regression analysis showed that mechanical ventilation and interstitial lung disease were independent predictors of prognosis in all patients, and mechanical ventilation was an independent predictor of prognosis in PIV infection group. Conclusions: Most of the patients with PIV lower respiratory tract infection in adults are complicated with underlying diseases and mixed infection, with a high 30-day mortality. Interstitial lung disease and mechanical ventilation indicate poor prognosis in these patients."

However, little is known about the factors causing exacerbations of pulmonary MAC disease in untreated patients. The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of radiological aggravations of pulmonary MAC disease. METHODS: From April 2011 to December 2018, 238 MAC patients at our institute were newly diagnosed with pulmonary MAC disease according to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society guideline. Their medical records were examined retrospectively for their clinical findings. The radiological findings at the time of the diagnosis and 1 year later were evaluated. To identify the predictors of radiological aggravation, multivariable analysis was performed with the data of 167 treatment-naive patients. RESULTS: Female, never-smoker, and nodular/bronchiectatic (NB) type were predominant in patients with pulmonary MAC disease. Univariate analysis of data from treatment-naive subjects showed that no lung diseases other than MAC, extensive radiological findings, and a positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear were significantly associated with radiological aggravations. On multivariate analysis, the radiological factor (larger affected area) and absence of other lung disease were significantly associated with radiological aggravations. In particular, the presence of abnormal shadows in more than 3 lobes was significantly associated with radiological aggravations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the presence of extensive radiological findings and the absence of lung diseases other than MAC were predictors of radiological aggravations of treatment-naive pulmonary MAC disease. In particular, the presence of abnormal shadows in more than 3 lobes was significantly associated with radiological aggravations."

NTM are ubiquitous in the environment, with certain species causing opportunistic infection in humans, including Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus. The incidence and prevalence of NTM infections are rising globally, especially in developed countries with declining incidence rates of M. tuberculosis infection. Mycobacterium avium, a slow-growing mycobacterium, is associated with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections that can cause chronic pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, as well as lymphadenitis. M. abscessus infections are considered one of the most antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria and are associated with pulmonary disease, especially cystic fibrosis, as well as contaminated traumatic skin wounds, postsurgical soft tissue infections, and healthcare-associated infections (HAI). Clinical manifestations of diseases depend on the interaction of the host's immune response and the specific mycobacterial species. This review will give a general overview of the general characteristics, vulnerable populations most at risk, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium, in the context of MAC, and M. abscessus."

The most common species causing pulmonary disease are members of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) can be chronic, debilitating, costly, and associated with a high mortality. However, MAC diagnoses are often delayed due to the nonspecific presentation of MAC-PD and radiological findings that overlap with other pulmonary diseases. Patients with risk factors and who meet the diagnostic criteria-which include clinical, radiological, and microbiologic criteria-should be considered for treatment. Diagnosis requires 2 or more positive sputum cultures or 1 bronchoscopic specimen culture. The recommendation for those who are treated is a 3-drug regimen including macrolide, rifamycin, and ethambutol that is continued for 12 months beyond sputum culture conversion to negative. MAC-PD is difficult to treat, with frequent drug-related side effects and suboptimal treatment outcomes. Refractory and recurrent disease is common, leading to lifelong follow-up of patients. There are limited treatment options for patients with macrolide-resistant or refractory disease. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is recommended for treatment-refractory patients whose cultures remain positive after 6 months of guideline-based therapy. Among the research priorities to improve patient outcomes and quality of life are developing new, more rapid diagnostic tests, investigating biomarkers associated with disease progression, and identifying new drugs and routes of administration as well as new, shorter, and better-tolerated regimens."

Even in tuberculosis endemic country such as India, they are being isolated from the clinical specimens more often than previously. This change in trend is of concern, because they are often misdiagnosed as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or even as drug-resistant tuberculosis. Objectives: A prospective, observational study was planned to identify the frequency and risk factors associated with pulmonary and extrapulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections. Agreement between two commercially available molecular systems, namely GenoType Mycobacteria CM assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) used in the identification of mycobacterial species is also analysed. Materials and Methods: NTM isolated from pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical specimens over a period of 11/2 year was included in the study. Patient demographics were collected, and the risk factors associated with NTM infections were analyzed. NTM grown on culture was speciated using GenoType Mycobacteria CM assay (HAIN Life Sciences, Germany) and MALDI TOF MS (bioMerieux, France). Drug-susceptibility tests were done for rapid-growing NTM using E-test (bioMerieux, France). Results: Eight hundred and fifty-four mycobacteria were isolated from 5009 specimens processed during the study period. Out of the mycobacteria grown, 74 (8.7%) were NTM and 780 (91.3%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The NTM isolated from pulmonary specimens were 46 (62.16%) and from extrapulmonary sources were 28 (37.84%). The most common species isolated from pulmonary specimens was Mycobacterium intracellulare and from extrapulmonary specimens was Mycobacterium abscessus. Concordance between the two commercial assays used for the identification was 96.49%. The most common risk factor associated with pulmonary NTM was previous lung pathology, while with extrapulmonary NTM infection was previous surgical intervention. Drug-susceptibility tests for rapid growers showed amikacin and clarithromycin as the most active drugs in vitro. Conclusions: NTM plays a significant role in causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections even in our part of the country with high endemicity of tuberculosis. NTM has emerged as important pathogens even in the immunocompetent patients. There is a need for rapid diagnosis and susceptibility testing of NTM to aid physicians administer timely and appropriate treatment to the patients."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic validity of gastric aspirate culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). METHODS: Gastric aspirates were collected from patients with suspected NTM-PD at the Osaka Toneyama Medical Center between December 2006 and February 2018. Patients with a final diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, an observation period less than six months, or less than three conducted sputum cultures were excluded from the study. NTM-PD was diagnosed as per ATS/IDSA criteria. We retrospectively examined the diagnostic validity of gastric aspirate culture in Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-PD and M. kansasii-PD by comparing culture results with final diagnoses. This was done first for all patients, and subsequently for patients with negative results for early sputum cultures. In addition, we compared the time required for an NTM-PD diagnosis based on gastric aspiration to that based on ATS/IDSA criteria. RESULTS: Among 475 total patients, 119 (25.1%) had positive NTM gastric aspirate cultures and 154 (32.4%) fulfilled the ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM-PD. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPVs) of gastric aspiration were 63.9%, 95.8%, 83.5%, and 88.8% in MAC-PD and 82.4%, 99.6%, 87.5%, and 99.3% in M. kansasii-PD, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of gastric aspirate cultures of the 378 patients who were undiagnosed based on sputum culture within 120 days were 34.0%, 95.5%, 51.6%, and 91.1% for MAC-PD and 75.0%, 99.5%, 60.0%, and 99.7% for M. kansasii-PD, respectively. Furthermore, gastric aspirate cultures tested in addition to bronchoscopy yielded incremental sensitivity of 8.7% (95.7% vs. 87.0%) and an NPV of 1.3% (99.3% vs. 98.0%) in MAC-PD. In NTM-PD patients with NTM-positive gastric aspirate cultures, the period between gastric aspirate collection and the positive culture result was shorter than the time between gastric aspirate collection and NTM-PD diagnosis [6 (9, 36) days vs. 25 (12, 69) days, median (IQR), p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: In settings where AFB pulmonary diseases are suspected, gastric aspirate culture may be helpful for diagnosing MAC-PD and M. kansasii-PD."

This study aimed to determine the clinical utility of these antibodies in assessing disease progression and the clinical characteristics of MAC-LD patients with negative antibody results. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive newly diagnosed, untreated MAC-LD patients in two referral hospitals. We evaluated the association of anti-GPL-core IgA antibody results with disease progression requiring treatment and the factors associated with negative antibody results. RESULTS: In total, 229 patients (161 females; median age, 71 years; 185 with nodular/bronchiectatic disease phenotype; 69 with cavitary lesions) were enrolled; 146 patients (64%) were anti-GPL-core IgA antibody-positive. Radiological severity scores were associated with anti-GPL-core IgA antibody titers. During the median 364-day follow-up, 114 patients (49.8%) required treatment. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that positive anti-GPL-core IgA antibody results, a younger age, the absence of malignancy, and the presence of cavitary lesions were associated with disease progression requiring treatment. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that significant factors related to the negative antibody results included underlying pulmonary disease, lower radiological scores, chronic sinusitis, and macrolide monotherapy. CONCLUSION: In addition to cavitary lesions, anti-GPL-core IgA antibody positivity was associated with disease progression requiring treatment. Physicians should carefully use anti-GPL-core IgA antibody results for the diagnosis of patients with underlying pulmonary disease, chronic sinusitis, macrolide monotherapy, and lower radiological severity."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium intracellulareID:32995571TITLE:Serological diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex lung diseases by enzyme immunoassay of IgA antibodies against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid core antigen.ABSTRACT:Introduction: There is an increasing trend worldwide in the incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary diseases (MAC-PD) and the diagnosis is sometimes complicated. Recently, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that detects serum IgA antibody against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core antigen had been developed and found to be useful in discriminating MAC-PD from other lung diseases. The antibody was subsequently also found to be elevated in patients suffering Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary diseases (MAB-PD). This study is to evaluate this EIA kit in the serological diagnosis of MAC-PD in Hong Kong Chinese patients. Methods: The study was conducted in Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong between July 2017 and July 2018. Assay of the IgA antibody level using the EIA kit was done on blood samples collected from patients suffering from MAC-PD, MAB-PD, pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases. Results: There were 100 subjects recruited into the study, among which 11 were excluded. By using the cut-off value 0.7 U/mL provided by the manufacturer, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis were 73.7% and 77.6% for MAC-PD; 50% and 77.6% for MAB-PD. By receiver operating characteristic curves analysis, new cut-off for MAC-PD and MAB-PD were calculated as 1.771 U/mL and 0.172 U/m, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 68.4% and 86.2% for MAC-PD, whereas 66.7% and 72.4% for MAB-PD. Conclusions: Our study showed that the enzyme immunoassay of IgA antibodies against MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid core antigen could help to distinguishing MAC and M. abscessus pulmonary diseases from pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases among Hong Kong Chinese patients. Further larger scale studies in our local population for the usefulness of this antibody test in the diagnosis and monitoring of MAC and M. abscessus lung diseases might be warranted."

The risk factors for hemoptysis are not well understood. In the current study, potential risk factors for hemoptysis were investigated in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease, which is the most common NTM in Japan. METHODS: Medical records from the Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center were reviewed. Consecutive patients with MAC lung disease diagnosed in 2014 and followed up for more than 1 year in the hospital were included in the study. Hemoptysis was confirmed between 2014 and 2016. The characteristics of patients with hemoptysis and non-hemoptysis at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease were obtained from the medical records, and the two groups were compared. The radiological findings assessed included nodules, infiltration shadows, cavities, and bronchiectasis. Each was classified and scored individually in six lung fields, and these data were used to generate radiological scores. RESULTS: The study included 82 patients with MAC lung disease, 18 with hemoptysis and 64 without. Higher total radiological severity score at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC was associated with an increased risk of hemoptysis. Among the radiological scores, infiltration and cavities were marginally associated with the risk of hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS: The radiological severity score at the time of initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease was associated with hemoptysis."

However, a large-scale epidemiological study on this issue in Korea is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of NTM infection after lung transplant surgery in Korea. METHODS: Between October 2012 and December 2018, we retrospectively evaluated lung transplant recipients in a referral hospital in South Korea. A total of 215 recipients were enrolled. The median age at transplantation was 56 years (range, 17-75), and 62% were men. Bronchoscopy was performed according to the surveillance protocol and clinical indications. A diagnosis of NTM infection was defined as a positive NTM culture from a bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample, or two separate sputum samples. We determined NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America 2007 guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for conditional survival analysis in patients with follow-up of >=12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6.5%) were diagnosed with NTM infection at a median of 11.8 months (range, 0.3-51.4) after transplantation. Nine patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with NTM-PD, and the incidence rate was 1980/100,000 person-years. Mycobacterium abscessus was the most common species causing NTM-PD (66%), followed by M. avium complex (33%). The presence of NTM infection did not influence all-cause mortality among those who underwent follow-up for >=12 months (N = 133, log-rank P = 0.816). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM-PD was considerably high among lung-transplant recipients. M. abscessus was the most common causative species of NTM-PD after lung transplantation."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium intracellulareID:33080299TITLE:How I Do It: Managing M. avium complex lung disease with a little help from my friend.ABSTRACT:Management of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease is complicated, frequently unsuccessful and frustrating to patients and clinicians. The initial treatment effort may not be solely directed at MAC infection, rather it is often initiating airway clearance measures for bronchiectasis. The next important steps are deciding who to treat and when to initiate therapy. Definitive or unambiguous guidance for these decisions is often elusive. The evidence supporting the current macrolide-based regimen for treating MAC lung disease is compelling. This regimen has been recommended in consensus nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) treatment guidelines from 1997, 2007 and 2020, although clinician compliance with these recommendations is inconsistent. Understanding the idiosyncrasies of MAC antibiotic resistance is crucial for optimal antibiotic management. As a corollary, the importance of avoiding development of macrolide resistance due to inadequate therapy cannot be overstated. An inhaled liposome amikacin preparation is now approved for treating refractory MAC lung disease and holds promise for an even broader role in MAC therapy. Surgery is also an important therapeutic adjunct for selected patients. Microbiologic recurrences due either to new infection or treatment relapse/failure are common and require the same level of rigorous assessment and clinical judgement for determining their significance as initial MAC isolates. In summary, management of MAC lung disease patients is rarely straight forward and requires familiarity with multiple factors directly and indirectly related to MAC lung disease. The many nuances of MAC lung disease therapy defy simple treatment algorithms but with patience, attention to detail and perseverance, the outcome for most patients is favorable."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium intracellulareID:33107481TITLE:Epidemiology, diagnosis & treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases.ABSTRACT:Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitously present in the environment, but NTM diseases occur infrequently. NTM are generally considered to be less virulent than Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, these organisms can cause diseases in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. As compared to tuberculosis, person-to-person transmission does not occur except with M. abscessus NTM species among cystic fibrosis patients. Lung is the most commonly involved organ, and the NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) occurs frequently in patients with pre-existing lung disease. NTM may also present as localized disease involving extrapulmonary sites such as lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues and rarely bones. Disseminated NTM disease is rare and occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired immune defects such as HIV/AIDS. Rapid molecular tests are now available for confirmation of NTM diagnosis at species and subspecies level. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) is not routinely done except in non-responsive disease due to slowly growing mycobacteria ( M. avium complex, M. kansasii) or infection due to rapidly growing mycobacteria, especially M. abscessus. While the decision to treat the patients with NTM-PD is made carefully, the treatment is given for 12 months after sputum culture conversion. Additional measures include pulmonary rehabilitation and correction of malnutrition. Treatment response in NTM-PD is variable and depends on isolated NTM species and severity of the underlying PD. Surgery is reserved for patients with localized disease with good pulmonary functions. Future research should focus on the development and validation of non-culture-based rapid diagnostic tests for early diagnosis and discovery of newer drugs with greater efficacy and lesser toxicity than the available ones."

Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and February 2019, 18 cases of NTM were diagnosed and their relevant clinical, diagnostic, and treatment details were recorded after taking informed consent. Results: We report 18 cases of NTM involving lungs (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), joint (n = 2), genitourinary (n = 1), and central nervous system (n = 1). History of immunosuppression was present in two patients, whereas history of some form of intervention was seen in six patients. Mycobacterium fortuitum group (n = 5) was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 4), Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 3), Mycobacterium kansasii (n = 2), and Mycobacterium chelonae (n = 1). In two patients, M. chelonae and M. abscessus were isolated in succession. Of these 18 patients, clinical response was present in 15 of the patients. Diagnosis and treatment of NTM in resource limited settings is extremely challenging. Conclusion: Most of the patients with NTM are misdiagnosed and are treated as tuberculosis in India, sometimes with a multidrug resistance regimen, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. We present these cases to shed some light on the epidemiology of NTM in this part of India."

However, the clinical impact of subsequent new-onset NTM-PD in bronchiectasis patients has not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical courses and radiographic changes of patients with bronchiectasis in whom NTM-PD subsequently developed. METHODS: A total of 221 patients with bronchiectasis who had participated in a non-NTM bronchiectasis cohort between July 1st 2011 and August 31st 2019 at Seoul National University Hospital were included in this study. The data of patients in whom NTM-PD developed during this observation period were analyzed; specifically, changes in the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and lesions on computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest arising during the observation period. RESULTS: During the observation period, NTM was isolated from 35 patients. A total of 31 patients (14.0%) satisfied the diagnostic criteria of NTM-PD. The median time from enrollment in the cohort to the development of subsequent NTM-PD was 37 months (Interquartile range [IQR], 18-78 months). Mycobacterium avium complex was the most common pathogen (80.6%). Twelve patients underwent antibiotic treatment for NTM-PD with a median interval of 20 months (IQR, 13-30) from the time of NTM-PD diagnosis. When NTM-PD developed, the severity and extent of bronchiectasis, cellular bronchiolitis, and the extent of nodules worsened on CT scans, while BSI did not change. CONCLUSIONS: NTM-PD can develop in previously negative bronchiectasis patients. It is associated with worsening radiographic lesions. Active screening of non-NTM bronchiectasis patients for new-onset NTM infection should be considered, especially if radiographic findings worsen. The BSI is not a reliable predictor of new-onset NTM-PD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was performed at Seoul National University Hospital ( NCT01616745 )."

Mycobacterium kansasii, a slow-growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria, causes disease in both humans and animals. While infections have been well described in humans, where it may be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, there are fewer reports in animals. Only four cases have been reported in the domestic cat.

METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients who were newly diagnosed with pulmonary NTM disease at participating institutions between August 2009 and December 2018. Patients were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study. Taking into consideration the presence of competing risks, we used the cumulative incidence function with Gray's test and Fine-Gray regression analysis for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients (34 RA patients and 191 non-RA controls) were followed, with a mean time of 47.5 months. Death occurred in 35.3% of RA patients and 25.7% of non-RA patients. An exacerbation of pulmonary NTM disease represented the major cause of death. The estimated cumulative incidence of all-cause death at 5 years was 24% for RA patients and 23% for non-RA patients. For NTM-related death, the 5-year cumulative incidence rate was estimated to be 11% for RA patients and 18% for non-RA patients. Gray's test revealed that long-term mortality estimates were not significantly different between patient groups. Fine-Gray regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for NTM-related death were advanced age (adjusted hazards ratio 7.28 [95% confidence interval 2.91-18.20] for >=80 years and 3.68 [1.46-9.26] for 70-80 years vs. <70 years), male sex (2.40 [1.29-4.45]), Mycobacterium abscessus complex (4.30 [1.46-12.69] vs. M. avium), and cavitary disease (4.08 [1.70-9.80]). CONCLUSIONS: RA patients with pulmonary NTM disease were not at greater risk of long-term mortality compared with non-RA patients. Rather, advanced age, male sex, causative NTM species, and cavitary NTM disease should be considered when predicting the outcomes of RA patients with pulmonary NTM disease."

The aetiological debate is not completely settled in the literature. METHOD: An observational study of 14 cases of HTL, diagnosed at the University Hospital of Besancon, France, between 2004 and 2018 according to the diagnostic criteria used in the clinic. RESULTS: This cohort corresponds to type I HP (inflammatory), with one case of type II HP. Decrease of lung transfer for carbon monoxide was present in 86% of examinations (n=12/14). In total, 84% of bronchoalveolar lavages showed a lymphocytic cellular pattern>=30% (n=11/13). The environmental survey enabled the identification of NTM in 93% of cases (n=13/14), mainly Mycobacterium avium. Serum precipitins directed against NTM were found in 10% of the cases (n=2/20). Three cases received corticosteroid therapy and none received antibiotics. Antigenic eviction has improved the symptomatology in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort supports the hypothesis that HTL is predominantly a type I HP. Avoidance of the agent involved (NTM) is necessary. The diagnosis is difficult because serum precipitins against NTM are not easily demonstrable. An environmental survey could facilitate the identification of the NTM. Prevention of HTL depends on education of the clinician and the patient."

Although mycobacterial infections are generally uncommon in horses, 10 equine abortion cases caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH) infections occurred between 2018 and 2019 in Japan. They occurred on seven Thoroughbred horse farms in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, but direct contact among the mares on different farms was not recorded. Most cases were characterized by extensive pathological lesions of the placenta, which are not typical in cases of common pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Escherichia coli. All abortions featured white-yellow exudates on the surface of the placenta. Mycobacterial granuloma formations were histologically found in the placenta and fetal organs, and acid-fast bacteria were isolated from the placenta, fetal samples (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and stomach contents) or uterine lavage fluid. The greatest number of bacteria was isolated from necrotic lesions on the placenta, which could be an important site for bacterial isolation in mycobacterial equine abortions. The isolates were identified as MAH based on internal genome sequences. In variable number tandem repeat analysis, all patterns of the strains were identical. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the core genome grouped all strains in the II-a/SC3 subcluster. Both results reveal that these strains share the same genetic background, suggesting that the horses had been infected by the same unknown contagious source."

Primary, which is associated with genetic mutation and familial predisposition and secondary, which is usually associated with infections, malignancies and autoimmune conditions. More often multiple risk factors are present at the time of initial presentation. We report a case where HLH was the presenting manifestation of relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the presence of multiple risk factors of secondary HLH such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active genital herpes, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and prior chemotherapy. A 38-year-old male to female transgender woman presented with one-week history of fever, nausea, vomiting and generalized weakness. The past medical history was significant for HIV and previously treated and positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed complete remission of Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Physical examination showed BP 92/40 mmHg, fever of 102.6 F, heart rate of 114 beats per minutes, diffuse abdominal tenderness and male genitalia with multiple small ulcerative lesions. Labs showed pancytopenia, hyponatremia, mildly elevated total and direct bilirubin, transaminitis, CD-4 count 96/mcL, HIV viral load undetectable and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative. Imaging showed right middle lung lobe consolidation and hepatosplenomegaly with multiple hypodense lesions. Lymphadenopathy was reported in mediastinum and retroperitoneum. The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, vasopressors and stress dose steroids. After initial improvement, vasopressors and steroids were stopped. The patient again started spiking fever on day 9 despite being on antibiotics. Workup showed EBV viremia, genital herpes and evidence of MAC infection on sputum culture. No improvement noted despite appropriate treatment for genital herpes and MAC. Additional lab work showed hyperferritinemia and elevated soluble Interleukin-2 receptors. The patient was diagnosed with HLH as per HLH-2004 criteria and treated with dexamethasone and etoposide. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed hemophagocytosis and immunoperoxidase staining established the diagnosis of relapsed Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma. We can conclude that in patients with a history of hematological malignancy presenting with HLH, a high degree of suspicion for relapse should be maintained even in the presence of other risk factors."

Bronchoscopy showed complete obstruction of the left basal bronchus by a tumor and a sleeve lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological examination showed typical carcinoid located in the left basal bronchus and many caseous granulomas containing mycobacteria in the lung parenchyma distal to the bronchus. Bacterial examinations of sputum and gastric juice after the operation showed a growth of Mycobacterium kansasii. Case 2 was a 50-year-old woman with the atelectasis of the left upper division. Bronchoscopy showed complete obstruction of the left upper division bronchus by a tumor and a left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological examination showed typical carcinoid located in the left upper division bronchus and many caseous granulomas in the lung parenchyma distal to the bronchus. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain showed many mycobacteria in these granulomas and they were identified as Mycobacterium avium by PCR analysis. Although NTM are not well recognized as possible pathogens of pulmonary infection related to bronchial obstruction by endobronchial carcinoma, our experiences rouse a caution to consider NTM as potential pathogens. We also discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for the specific relationship between carcinoid tumor and TNM."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium kansasiiID:12708897TITLE:Pathologic features of Mycobacterium kansasii infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.ABSTRACT:CONTEXT: Mycobacterium kansasii is a slow-growing photochromogenic mycobacterium that may infect patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) late in the course of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The clinical features of pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections have been described in the literature; however, the pathology of infection has not been adequately addressed. OBJECTIVE: This report describes the pathologic features of 12 cases of M kansasii infection in patients with AIDS. DESIGN: The medical records, autopsy protocols, cytologic material, and histologic material from patients with AIDS and concomitant M kansasii infection at a tertiary-care medical center during 1990-2001 were reviewed. RESULTS: Twelve cases were identified, 6 by autopsy, 5 of which were diagnosed postmortem. Four of the 12 cases had cytologic material and 4 cases had histologic biopsies available for review. Pulmonary infection was most common (9/12), and all patients in whom thoracic lymph nodes were assessed showed involvement (7/7). Abdominal infection was less frequent, with only 1 of 6, 2 of 6, and 2 of 6, demonstrating liver, spleen, and abdominal lymph node infection, respectively. Isolated infections without documented pulmonary infection included brain abscess (n = 1), ulnar osteomyelitis (n = 1), and paratracheal mass (n = 1). Cytologic and histologic material showed a wide range of inflammatory reactions, including granulomas with and without necrosis, neutrophilic abscesses, spindle-cell proliferations, and foci of granular eosinophilic necrosis. The M kansasii bacillus was characteristically long, coarsely beaded, and frequently showed folded, bent, or curved ends. Intracellular bacilli were randomly or haphazardly distributed within histiocytes. CONCLUSION: Mycobacterium kansasii infection produces predominantly pulmonary infection in late-stage AIDS with a high incidence of thoracic lymph node involvement and a much lower incidence of dissemination to other sites. Infection is manifest as a wide variety of inflammatory reactions on cytology and histology; however, the characteristic appearance of the bacillus on acid-fast bacilli stain and its intracellular arrangement in histiocytes can allow a presumptive identification."

We retrospectively studied HIV-infected patients with pulmonary M. kansasii isolated between 1989 and 2002 at one institution. Of 127 patients, 33% fulfilled ATS disease criteria. Twenty-nine percent received at least three active drugs for at least 3 months, and 53% died. In survival analysis, a lower CD4 count (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.3) and positive smear microscopy (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.1) were associated with mortality, whereas antiretroviral therapy (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8) and M. kansasii treatment (HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) were associated with survival. ATS criteria did not predict mortality (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9). Fifteen patients (12%) apparently had indolent infection, not requiring immediate therapy. They had fewer positive cultures and lower rates of positive smear microscopy and ATS-defined disease. In HIV-infected patients with pulmonary M. kansasii infection, predictors of survival include higher CD4 counts, antiretroviral therapy, negative smear microscopy, and adequate treatment for M. kansasii infection, but not ATS diagnostic criteria. Withholding treatment in HIV-infected patients with respiratory M. kansasii isolates should only be considered with negative smear microscopy, few positive cultures, and mild immunosuppression."

An in-depth evaluation of the innate and adaptive immune systems was performed for five available patients. A comparison was made of the genetic fingerprint patterns of the isolates obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, with the major polymorphic tandem repeat (MPTR) as a probe. Predisposing factors consisted of smoking, airway abnormalities, substance abuse, diabetes or poor general condition, but in two patients no risk factor was identified. In the five patients tested, no abnormalities or deficiencies were detected in the innate or adaptive type-1 immunity. All M. kansasii isolates had identical MPTR RFLP patterns, although no epidemiological connection could be established, and these were identical to those of clinical isolates from Australian patients. These data do not support the theory that defects in the innate or adaptive type-1 immunity have a role in the pathogenesis of invasive M. kansasii infections. The identical fingerprint patterns of the isolates suggested the existence of a virulent strain of M. kansasii."

FINDINGS: 302 patients were confirmed to have M kansasii pulmonary infection; diagnosis was not made until death in 2%. The average age was 50 years old; 76% were white; all were men. Productive cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain were common; 16% were asymptomatic. Right sided, apical or subapical, thin walled cavitary infiltrate was the characteristic radiological feature. Heavy smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism, peptic ulcer disease, coronary artery disease, prior tuberculosis, psychosis, prior pneumonia, and immunocompromising conditions were prevalent. Average follow up was 10 years and 2 months. PPD was positive in 58% of 179 tested. Two thirds of the patients required only first line drugs. Fourteen per cent required surgical intervention, none after 1977. Spontaneous resolution occurred in 1%. Aspergillosis developed in 4%. Bronchogenic carcinoma coexisted with M kansasii infection in 6% and followed it in 4%. Extrapulmonary malignancy coexisted with the infection in 4% and followed it in 6%; most involved head and neck. Eleven per cent of 224 deaths were attributed to M kansasii. Outcomes were affected by comorbidity, treatment compliance, rifampicin use, and extent of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis of M kansasii pulmonary infection is good if diagnosed and treated early, together with control of underlying conditions. Clinicians should be aware of atypical radiological manifestations of the disease when coexisting with other pulmonary or immunocompromising conditions."

METHODS: Hospital discharge diagnoses were established for 521 HIV-positive patients. RESULTS: Respiratory disease accounted for 49% of the admissions. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) was the main cause of respiratory disease (52%) followed by Pneumocystis carinii (PCP, 24%), non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM, 11%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, 9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease was established using bacteriological, clinical and radiographic criteria. NTM disease was defined following the American Thoracic Society criteria. NTM was disseminated in the majority of cases (19 Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), one Mycobacterium kansasii). Nine patients had respiratory disease (seven MAC, one Mycobacterium fortuitum, one Mycobacterium kansasii) and one had gastrointestinal disease caused by MAC. Mortality was 10% for NTM disseminated cases; none of the TB patients died over the course of the study. The length of hospitalization for NTM patients was longer (15+/-13 days) than for other respiratory cases (10+/-10, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: NTM disease along with its related mortality is a significant pathology as a cause of hospitalization among HIV-infected individuals."

DESIGN: We reviewed the records of all patients with M. kansasii and HIV infection treated between January 1985 and June 1990. SETTING: The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with M. kansasii and HIV infection were identified; 14 patients had exclusive pulmonary infection, 3 patients had pulmonary and extrapulmonary infection, and 2 patients had exclusive extrapulmonary infection. At the time of diagnosis of M. kansasii infection, the median CD4+ lymphocyte count was 49 cells/microL (range, 0 to 198 cells/microL), and 16 of 19 patients had a previous diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). All 17 patients with pulmonary infection presented with fever and cough of at least 2 weeks duration. Chest radiographs showed either focal upper lobe infiltrates (n = 8) or diffuse interstitial infiltrates (n = 9); 9 patients also had thin-walled cavitary lesions. Nine patients with pulmonary M. kansasii infection were treated with antituberculosis chemotherapy, with resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, improvement of radiographic infiltrates, and sputum conversion; 1 patient with M. kansasii osteomyelitis also responded to antituberculosis therapy. Autopsies done on 3 treated patients did not reveal any evidence of M. kansasii infection. Nine patients did not receive any antituberculosis chemotherapy; 2 untreated patients developed progressive cavitary pulmonary disease and died from M. kansasii pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium kansasii causes serious and potentially life-threatening pulmonary disease in patients with advanced HIV-related immunosuppression. In contrast to previous reports, our findings indicate that disease produced by M. kansasii in patients with HIV infection is responsive to antituberculosis chemotherapy."

The authors' experience].ABSTRACT:UNLABELLED: The diagnosis of NTM-related pulmonary disease is based on clinical symptoms, radiological features and several positive cultures of one and the same NTM species from samples obtained from the respiratory tract. Short hospitalization usually does not enable sufficient diagnostic procedures to meet the diagnostic criteria, and this may lead to the reduction of diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of the study was to draw attention to NTM-related pulmonary disease, to share the authors' experience in the diagnosing of pulmonary mycobacteriosis and to indicate the possibilities of improving the diagnostic accuracy in this disease. A group of 31 patients with sputum, bronchial washing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) NTM-positive cultures was selected from a cohort of 245 patients evaluated for tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases (total number of 1277 specimens were invastigated). In two of them NTM related pulmonary disease was diagnosed (caused by M. kansasii and M. avium) at the course of initial evaluation. In the remaining 29 patients the microbiological data did not allow to establish the diagnosis of mycobacterial lung disease mainly due to a small number of samples from the respiratory tract. From this group 13 patients were reevaluated within 3 - 6 months from the initial investigation. This allowed to identify two new cases of mycobacteriosis (M. kansasii and M. avium). Thus among 31 patients with NTM positive cultures from respiratory tract specimens 4 patients (4/31, 12,9%) met the diagnostic criteria for mycobacterial disaease. CONCLUSION: Microbiological analysis of an adequate number of samples in symptomatic patients with radiological features suggestive for NTM-related pulmonary disease increses the diagnostic sensitivity in pulmonary mycobacteriosis. Identification of the species in positive cultures is of great importance."

The incidence of NTM infections has been increasing since the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemics. However, the epidemiologic and clinical data of NTM infections in Thailand are limited. OBJECTIVE: Determine the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcome of NTM infections in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2000 to December 2003. MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred and fourteen patients had positive NTM cultures; however, complete medical records were available in only 103 (90.3%) patients. RESULTS: There were 71 (68.9%) HIV-infected patients, and 38 (87%) of them had the CD4 counts of &lt; 200 cells/microL (range 4-360). Among HIV-infected patients, the most common previous opportunistic infections included tuberculosis (36.6%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (25.3%), cryptococcal meningitis (15.5%), penicilliosis (5.6%), and cytomegalovirus infection (5.6%). Most patients presented with prolonged fever (67%), chronic cough (54.4%), lymphadenopathy (52.4%), weight loss (50.5%), or chronic diarrhea (31%). The clinical manifestations included disseminated (17.4%) and localized (82.6%) infections. The localized infection included pulmonary infection (82.3%), followed by gastrointestinal infection (34.1%), skin infection (12.9%), lymphadenitis (8.2%), genitourinary tract infection (2.4%), central nervous system infection (2.4%), and keratitis (1.2%). Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the predominant species (48.5%), followed by M. kansasii (19.4%), and rapidly growing mycobacteria (16.4%). Diffuse reticular infiltration was most commonly observed on chest radiography (53.4%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anemia (48.5%), hyponatremia (42.7%), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (39.8%). The overall mortality rate was 34.8% (45.9% and 11.1% in HIV- and HIV-noninfected patients). CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of NTM infection requires a high index of suspicion in patients especially with AIDS or immunocompromised status who present with prolonged fever, with or without organ-specific symptoms and signs. Therefore, clinical specimens must be sent for mycobacterial cultures for a definite diagnosis, a determination of the species of NTM, and an appropriate management. In addition to four standard antituberculous drugs, clarithromycin should be added for the treatment of MAC in patients with AIDS who presented with disseminated opportunistic infections before obtaining the microbiologic results."

The mean age at the onset of RA and the duration of RA was 57.2 +/- 15.2 years and 10.9 +/- 11.5 years, respectively. Pulmonary infections included nontuberculous mycobacteriosis in 59 patients (Mycobacterium avium complex infection, 50 cases : Mycobacterium kansasii infection, 4 cases; others, 5 cases), pneumonia in 46 patients, pulmonary tuberculosis in 28 patients, pulmonary aspergillosis in 12 patients, pulmonary cryptococcosis in 5 patients, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in 5 patients, lung abscess in 9 patients, exacerbation of bronchiectasis in 7 patients, and empyema in 4 patients. One hundred percent of patients with exacerbation of bronchiectasis, 91.7% of patients with pulmonary aspergillosis, 87% of patients with pneumonia, and 81.4% of patients with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis had underlying lung diseases. The pulmonary infections during therapy with steroids were pulmonary tuberculosis (78.6%), pneumonia (65.2%), and pulmonary aspergillosis (58.3%), while the pulmonary infections during methotrexate treatment were Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (80%), pulmonary cryptococcosis (40%), and pulmonary tuberculosis (28.6%). Pulmonary infections in RA patients who were taking TNFalpha inhibitors included 1 patient each with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Among the RA patients with lung abscess, malignancy was noted in 55.6%, and diabetes mellitus in 22.2%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second-most-common cause of pneumonia and cause of all exacerbations of bronchiectasis. As well as immunosuppressive medications (steroids, methotrexate, TNFalpha inhibitors) and systemic comorbid diseases, underlying lung diseases could be one of the risk factor for pulmonary infections in patients with RA. The dominant risk factor for each pulmonary infection in patients with RA might be different."

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the morphotype, immunophenotype, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genotype in a large cohort with PNTM. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 63 patients with PNTM infection, each of whom had computerized tomography, echocardiogram, pulmonary function, and flow cytometry of peripheral blood. In vitro cytokine production in response to mitogen, LPS, and cytokines was performed. Anthropometric measurements were compared with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) age- and ethnicity-matched female control subjects extracted from the NHANES 2001-2002 dataset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 59.9 (+/-9.8 yr [SD]) old, and 5.4 (+/-7.9 yr) from diagnosis to enrollment. Patients were 95% female, 91% white, and 68% lifetime nonsmokers. A total of 46 were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex, M. xenopi, or M. kansasii; 17 were infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria. Female patients were significantly taller (164.7 vs. 161.0 cm; P &lt; 0.001) and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 28.2; P &lt; 0.001) than matched NHANES control subjects, and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 26.8; P = 0.002) than patients with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. A total of 51% of patients had scoliosis, 11% pectus excavatum, and 9% mitral valve prolapse, all significantly more than reference populations. Stimulated cytokine production was similar to that of healthy control subjects, including the IFN-gamma/IL-12 pathway. CD4(+), CD8(+), B, and natural killer cell numbers were normal. A total of 36% of patients had mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNTM infection are taller and leaner than control subjects, with high rates of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations, but without recognized immune defects."

However, NTM are a heterogeneous group and most of the data come from only three species: Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus. Still, information about these three species is confusing because it is based mainly on retrospective studies and series of clinical cases performed in developed countries. In recent years, new information has appeared about other species and the pathogenesis of NTM. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that NTM infection is a worldwide phenomenon with an increasing presence in developing countries perhaps because of the implementation of tap water. Women with characteristic phenotype are at higher risk of acquiring NTM infection along with patients with defects on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. New studies on Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium szulgai and Mycobacterium simiae indicate that the American Thoracic Society criteria for diagnosing NTM disease may not be useful for all species of NTM. SUMMARY: New multicentric and prospective studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of NTM. These organisms form a numerous and heterogeneous group and each species should be studied separately."

However, there is uncertainty regarding the association between long-term use of ICS and exacerbations of respiratory tract infections among asthmatic patients. METHODS: A case-control nested cohort study was performed to assess the association of asthma with nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infection. RESULTS: Among this cohort of 464 asthmatic patients, 14 experienced complications due to NTM infections, of which eight were caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, three by M. kansasii, one by M.terrae and the remaining two by unclassifiable scotochromogens. Asthmatic patients with NTM infections were older (67.1 +- 8.6 vs 58.8 +- 12.3 years, P &lt; 0.01) and had more severe airflow limitation (FEV(1) %, 60.6 +- 10.3 vs 72.3 +- 18.3, P &lt; 0.03) than those without NTM infections.

Necropsy findings were similar in both cases and consisted of disseminated granulomatous lesions in the liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, pleural surfaces, and multiple lymph nodes. Mycobacterium kansasii was isolated from both cases after multiple attempts on a variety of samples by two laboratories. The remaining four animals in the herd were tested for antibody responses using the Chembio ElephantTB STAT-PAK, DPP VetTB kits, and multi-antigen print immunoassay (MAPIA), for immune reaction using the intradermal tuberculin test, and by tracheal wash cultures, and thoracic radiographs. Banked serum samples collected in 2005 and obtained from the original institution, revealed 1/9 (11.11%) seropositive animals using the three immunoassays. Retesting the current herd in 2008 showed 2/6 (33.33%) seropositive animals by the three tests, with MAPIA demonstrating antibody reactivity to MPB83 and MPB70 proteins. Inconsistent intradermal tuberculin test results, cross-reactivity in serologic assays designed for tuberculosis detection, difficulty in obtaining definitive identification by culture, and inability to identify a source of infection created challenges in distinguishing the atypical mycobacteriosis due to M. kansasii from the initially suspected tuberculous infection in this herd. Owing to regulatory considerations, differences in host-to-host transmission, and source of infection between Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and nontuberculous mycobacteria, correct diagnosis is crucial for management of these diseases in wildlife species."

This study examined household water and shower aerosols of patients with NTM pulmonary disease. The mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples from 20 patients included M. avium (5 patients), M. intracellulare (12 patients), M. abscessus (7 patients), M. gordonae (1 patient), M. lentiflavum (1 patient), M. fortuitum (1 patient), M. peregrinum (1 patient), M. chelonae (1 patient), M. triplex (1 patient), and M. kansasii (1 patient). One-liter water samples and swabs were collected from all taps, and swimming pools or rainwater tanks. Shower aerosols were sampled using Andersen six-stage cascade impactors. For a subgroup of patients, real-time PCR was performed and high-resolution melt profiles were compared to those of ATCC control strains. Pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from 19 homes. Species identified in the home matched that found in the patient in seven (35%) cases: M. abscessus (3 cases), M. avium (1 case), M. gordonae (1 case), M. lentiflavum (1 case), and M. kansasii (1 case). In an additional patient with M. abscessus infection, this species was isolated from potable water supplying her home. NTM grown from aerosols included M. abscessus (3 homes), M. gordonae (2 homes), M. kansasii (1 home), M. fortuitum complex (4 homes), M. mucogenicum (1 home), and M. wolinskyi (1 home). NTM causing human disease can be isolated from household water and aerosols. The evidence appears strongest for M. avium, M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, and M. abscessus. Despite a predominance of disease due to M. intracellulare, we found no evidence for acquisition of infection from household water for this species. "

The initial stage of disease was defined as the period when less than one-sixth of the total lung area was affected by the infection, as visualized on chest radiography and CT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four patients were diagnosed with M.kansasii infection between 1996 and 2010 and 835 patients, with M.tuberculosis infection between 2008 and 2009 at our hospital. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the results of sputum culture and/or bronchial washing. After excluding the patients with underlying lung diseases such as chronic pulmonary emphysema, interstitial pneumonia, and old pulmonary tuberculosis as well as those in advanced stages, 24 patients with M. kansasii infection and 62 patients with M. tuberculosis infection were included in this study. The affected segments of the lungs and the rates of cavity development were determined by using CT scans. RESULTS: In patients with M.kansasii, 17 had an infected right lung, while 7 had an infected left lung. Additionally, in patients with M.tuberculosis, 58 had an infected right lung, 3 had an infected left lung, and 1 had a bilateral infection. In patients infected with M. kansasii, the upper lobes were affected in 22 cases and the lower lobes in 3 cases. In patients infected with M. tuberculosis, the upper, middle, and lower lobes and the lingular segment were affected in 41, 8, 24, and 1 cases, respectively. Upper lobe lesions were seen more frequently in patients with M. kansasii infection than in those with M. tuberculosis infection (p &lt; 0.05). Cavity formation was identified more frequently in patients infected with M. kansasii (91.7%) than in those infected with M. tuberculosis (32.3%) (p &lt; 0.001). Cavitary lesions were more frequently localized to the apical, posterior, and apico-posterior regions (S1, S2 or S1 +2) of the upper lobes in patients infected with M. kansasii (86.4%) than in those infected with M. tuberculosis (35%) (p &lt; 0.001). A solitary lesion without endobronchial spread, which is characterized by centrilobular micronodules and tree-in-bud appearance, was more frequently demonstrated in patients infected with M.ka nsasii (45.8%) than in those infected with M. tuberculosis (6.5%) (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that the apical, posterior, and apico-posterior regions of the upper lobes are vulnerable to infection by not only M.tu berculosis, but also M.ka nsasii. It is likely that M.ka nsasii might gain access to these regions via the airways and that its weak virulence may lead to higher localization."

METHODS: We retrospectively selected 220 patients who satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NTM disease proposed by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Nine patients with pulmonary NTM disease were complicated with pneumothorax. We investigated the patients' background, laboratory findings, radiological findings, treatment and prognoses. RESULTS: There were nine patients, including six men and three women, with a mean age of 73.2 years. Seven patients had underlying respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) excluding pulmonary NTM disease. The causative microorganisms was Mycobacterium avium in four patients, M. intracellulare in four patients, and M. kansasii in one patient. Regarding the radiological findings, pneumothorax was recognized in the right lung in five patients, in the left lung in three patients, and in both lungs heterogeneously in one patient. Although most patients exhibited multiple cavities and extensive lesions over the unilateral lung fields, three patients were simultaneously diagnosed with pulmonary NTM disease at the onset of pneumothorax. As for treatment, thoracic drainage was performed in seven patients, while one patient was advised only to rest and one patient required both thoracic drainage and surgery. The responses to the treatment was poor in each case, and five patients died due to pneumonia or heart failure. CONCLUSION: In this study, the rate of pneumothorax complications in the patients with pulmonary NTM disease (4.1%) was higher than that of other reports. The responses to treatment, and prognoses were poor due to the presence of other complications."

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL &lt;0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration."

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

Patients with cDGS and mycobacterial infection have not previously been described. We present this case to illustrate that patients with cDGS are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and to discuss further antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to thymic transplantation. METHODS: A 13-month old male was identified as T cell deficient by the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay on newborn screening, and was subsequently confirmed to have cDGS. He presented with fever and cough, and was treated for chronic aspiration pneumonia as well as Pneumocystis jirovecii infection without significant improvement. It was only after biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes seen on CT that the diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii was made. We reviewed the literature regarding atypical mycobacterial infections and prophylaxis used in other immunocompromised patients, as well as the current data regarding cDGS detection through TREC newborn screening. RESULTS: Multiple cases of cDGS have been diagnosed via TREC newborn screening, however this is the first patient with cDGS and disseminated mycobacterial infection to be reported in literature. Thymic transplantation is the definitive treatment of choice for cDGS. Prophylaxis with either clarithromycin or azithromycin has been shown to reduce mycobacterial infections in children with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cDGS should receive thymic transplantion as soon as possible, but prior to this are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Severe, opportunistic infections may require invasive testing for diagnosis in patients with cDGS. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered to prevent disseminated mycobacterial infection in these patients."

The development of molecular methods has allowed the characterization of new species and the identification of NTM to the precise species and subspecies levels. The incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease are increasing worldwide, and this syndrome accounts for the majority of clinical cases of NTM disease. Common causative organisms of pulmonary infection are the slowly growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium kansasii and the rapidly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex. NTM lung disease often affects elderly people with chronic lung disease and may be a manifestation of a complex genetic disorder determined by interactions among multiple genes, as well as environmental exposures. To be diagnosed with NTM lung disease, patients should meet all clinical and microbiologic criteria, but the decision to start treatment is complex, requiring careful individualized analysis of risks and benefits. Clinicians should be alert to the unique aspects of NTM lung disease, including the need for proper diagnosis, the availability of advanced molecular methods for species and subspecies identification, and the benefits and limitations of recommended treatments."

During the neutropenic period, performing invasive procedures for microbiological or pathological confirmation is difficult. In addition, the optimal treatment duration for NTM disease in patients with leukemia, especially prior to stem cell transplantation (SCT), has not been documented. Therefore, we report a case of pneumonia with necrotizing lymphadenitis caused by Mycobacterium kansasii diagnosed during chemotherapy being performed for acute myeloid leukemia. The radiologic findings were similar to those of invasive fungal pneumonia; however, a bronchoalveolar washing fluid culture confirmed that the pathogen was M. kansasii. After 70 days from starting NTM treatment, allogeneic SCT was performed without any complications.

Here we aimed to examine the main epidemiological aspects and diagnostic challenges associated with NTM in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and compare these findings to the international arena findings. Data revealed that countries of the GCC are largely dominated by rapidly growing mycobacteria species such as M. fortuitum (29%) and M. abscessus (17%) with high rate of definitive respiratory diseases. On the other hand, most of the developed countries are dominated by slowly growing mycobacteria such as MAC, M. kansasii, and M. gordonae.

After identifying an NTM in the respiratory tract, clinical and radiological aspects must be considered to determine if isolations are clinically relevant.

However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of PNTM-associated CPA. In the present investigation, we aimed to elucidate the clinical course and prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 62 patients with CPA and a history of PNTM who were admitted to Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center between 2010 and 2015. Co-morbidities, causative microorganisms, radiological findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 69.5 years, and the median follow-up period was 4.2 years. The major underlying diseases, other than PNTM and CPA, were old pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia. The most common causative NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC; 37 patients; 59.7%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (20 patients; 32.3%). Survival was 83% after 1 year and 61% after 5 years. Use of systemic corticosteroids (hazard ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-9.51; P=0.00177) and C-reactive protein levels &gt;= 5.0 mg/dL (hazard ratio: 8.96, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-62.9; P=0.0014) at the time of CPA diagnosis were associated with increased over-all mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CPA frequently developed in patients with MAC and M. kansasii PNTM. The treatment course of PNTM was not associated with all-cause mortality. However, systemic corticosteroid use and high CRP levels were negative prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM.

Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common involved pathogen, followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (MABSC), while Mycobacterium kansasii is not a major concern. The rate of infection rate in lung transplant recipients is reported to range from 1.5-22.4%. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here four cases of NTM pulmonary infection and disease among 63 patients who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at our hospital. Those four occurred following living-donor transplantation in two patients, one with pulmonary arterial hypertension and one with bronchiectasia, and deceased donor lung transplantation in two patients, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and interstitial pneumonia, respectively. NTM was not detected in any of the patients prior to transplantation. The involved pathogens were Mycobacterium gordonae in one, MAC in one, and MABSC in two of these patients, which were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in two and sputum in two. The one case of MAC and two of MABSC were symptomatic with consolidation shown in chest CT images indicating possible pneumonia, while the one with M. gordonae had no symptoms and was detected by surveillance BAL. Onset time from detection of NTM was greater than 3 years in the three with MABSC and M. gordonae and less than 3 years in the one with MAC. Each patient required a decrease in immunosuppressive agents according to their condition, while antibiotics therapy was performed in the three who were symptomatic. Sputum culture findings became negative after several months and were maintained thereafter in all. CONCLUSION: An NTM infection leading to pulmonary disease can occur at any time following lung transplantation. Treatment should be considered depending on the involved pathogens, individual status, and disease severity."

However, some clinicians may be concerned regarding the lengthy course and numerous adverse effects. This study evaluated the natural course of MK-PD and investigated its prognostic factors. METHODS: Radiographic outcome, prognostic factors, and mortality within 1 year for MK-PD were obtained from patients in 6 hospitals in Taiwan from 2010 to 2014 (derivation cohort) and validated using patients in 2015 and 2016 (validation cohort). RESULTS: Of the 109 patients with MK-PD in the derivation cohort, radiographic progression occurred in 70 (64%), with a 1-year mortality rate of 43% and median survival of 71 days, whereas none of the 39 cases without radiographic progression died. All patients with acid-fast smear (AFS) grade &gt;= 3 experienced radiographic progression. For the others, the independent risk factors of radiographic progression were fibroCavitary pattern, Leucocyte count &gt;9000/muL, Old age (age &gt;65 years), pUre MK in sputum (no other mycobacteria), and no Diabetes mellitus (the CLOUD factors).

METHODS: Sixty nineM. kansasii isolates from 69 patients were identified by partial sequencing of the hsp65 gene and had their susceptibility profiles analyzed by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. RESULTS: From 69 isolates, 68 showed susceptibility to clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin. Most strains showed high rates of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Resistance to rifampicin and ethambutol was found (in 12% and 25% of isolates, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We have observed worrying results regarding susceptibility to some drugs used as first-line agents in the treatment of diseases caused byM. kansasii."

However, the long-term evaluation of clinico-epidemiological features of NTM-PD in relation to TB are limited. We aimed to clarify the long-term changes in the epidemiology and clinical features of NTM-PD in relation to those of TB at a nationally-designated TB center in Japan. METHODS: We reviewed all mycobacterial examination records at Fukujuji Hospital between 2006 and 2016. Cases of NTM-PD were defined according to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America microbiologic criteria. The current characteristics of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) were compared with those in the 1980s and circa 2000. RESULTS: We identified a total of 3,546 pulmonary TB cases and 2,155 NTM-PD cases. While the annual number of incident pulmonary TB cases remained stable over the study period (P = 0.59), that of NTM-PD cases increased significantly from 165 to 278 (P &lt; 0.01). The mean age of pulmonary TB cases increased from 59.7 +- 16.3 to 66.2 +- 21.7 years, whereas that of NTM-PD cases remained unchanged. Regarding the age distribution, the greatest increases were observed in patients over 75 years for TB and in patients 50-74 years for NTM. The most common causative organism for NTM was Mycobacterium avium complex (87.3%), M. abscessus complex (5.5%) and M. kansasii (3.9%). Among patients with MAC-PD, the proportion of the nodular bronchiectatic (NB) form increased significantly from 60.0% to 84.4% between circa 2000 and 2016 (P &lt; 0.01). Significant increases in the NB form were observed in both males (33.3%-70.7%, P &lt; 0.01) and females (71.3%-89.2%, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The annual number of incident NTM-PD cases increased markedly. In contrast to patients with TB, the mean age of new NTM-PD patients did not increase in the last 10 years. Among MAC-PD patients, the proportions accounted for by the NB form increased significantly in both sexes."

Infection is typically seen in middle aged males, and the risk of infection is greatly increased in immunocompromised hosts. Pulmonary infection presents in clinical parallel to that of Mycobaterium tuberculosis (TB) and is therefore often misdiagnosed. A combination of clinical, radiological, and microbiological evidence of infection is generally required to clinch the diagnosis. Treatment of such cases include prolonged courses of rifampin in combination with 2 other antimicrobial agents. The overall prognosis with appropriate treatment is good with the exception of disseminated disease in severely immunocompromised hosts. In patients who are misdiagnosed or undertreated, there is progressive destruction of the lung parenchyma with distortion of lung architecture. This can in-turn lead to bronchiectatic changes leaving the airways exposed to devastating superimposed bacterial pneumonia. We describe a case of a patient with untreated M. kansasii infection who developed superimposed necrotizing pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support."

The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of NTM infection from respiratory samples and to determine their clinical significance. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 7,825 clinical samples from December 2015 to December 2017. Detection was conducted using phenotypic and genotypic (hsp65 PCR-RFLP, rpoB, and 16S rRNA genes sequencing) methods. All clinical information including symptoms and radiological findings was extracted from patients' records. Results: A total of 478 were confirmed to have respiratory samples which were culture positive for mycobacteria, with the prevalence of NTM infection obtained as 53 (11.1%). Overall, Mycobacterium (M.) fortuitum was the most frequent NTM isolate, followed by M. simiae, M. kansasii, M. gordonae, and M. conceptionense. There was a relationship between NTM isolates and gender (P=0.039), symptoms (P=0.048), and radiographic findings (P=0.013). Bronchiectasis, infiltration, and cavitary lesion were the most frequent radiological findings in M. fortuitum, M. simiae, and M. kansasii, respectively, with cough being the most frequent symptom. Conclusion: We reported five different NTM isolates in respiratory samples with a high frequency of M. fortuitum. NTM infections may play an important role in causing pulmonary disease and in tuberculosis management in endemic settings. Nevertheless, more studies are required to further examine the clinical significance of NTM isolates."

NTM can cause a wide range of infections. However, pulmonary NTM disease is the most frequent clinical picture. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate drug susceptibility of slow growing NTM isolated from pulmonary samples of patients prediagnosed as tuberculosis between 2014 and 2018 in Ataturk Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training and Research Hospital Microbiology Laboratory by a commercial microtube dilution plaque method. A total of 435 NTM strains obtained from suspected TB patients were included in the study. After the samples were processed by homogenization and decontamination and acid-fast staining, culture in two solid media (Lowenstein-Jensen, Ogawa) and in MGIT-BACTEC960 automated system were performed. Acid-fast bacilli isolated from culture media were identified by using cart test (MPB64, Capilla TB-Neo) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based reverse hybridization ""line probe assay (LPA)"" method (GenoType MycobacteriumCM/AS, Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Germany). After DNA isolation from the culture, PCR was performed by using the primers specific for mycobacterial 23S rRNA spacer region. PCR products were then hybridized with the probes specific for Mycobacterium species on nitrocellulose strips according to the recommendations of the manufacturer and the results were evaluated. In this study, Mycobacterium avium (n= 77, 17.7%), Mycobacterium intracellulare (n= 70, 16.1%), Mycobacterium szulgai (n= 19, 4.4%), Mycobacterium kansasii (n= 10, 2.3%) ve Mycobacterium smiae (n= 9, 2.1%) were isolated as slowly growing mycobacteria from the pulmonary patients. Susceptibility testing was performed in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMH), supplemented with ""oleic acid, albumin dextrose catalase"" according to CLSI/ M24-A2 guideline recommendations. For the antibiotic susceptibility test, ready-to-use plaque drugs for slow-growing mycobacteria (SLOMYCO-Sensititre, TREK Diagnostic Systems Ltd, UK), were used. M.intracellulare, M.avium, M.kansasii and M.smiae isolates were found to be sensitive to clarithromycin %100, %99, %100 and %100, respectively. For M.intracellulare and M.avium isolates, moxifloxacin and linezolid sensitivity values were found to be 91%, 64% and 80%, 74% respectively. M.kansasii isolates were more sensitive than M.simiae isolates to the most of the drugs. M.kansasii isolates, were susceptible to rifabutin, rifampin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, linezolid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin and etambutol, with the frequencies of 100%, 90%, 100%, 100%, 80%, 70% and 50%, respectively. The study showed that the species identification and drug susceptibility testing of frequently isolated slow-growing NTM's from pulmonary specimens could guide for the treatment."

M. kansasii is known to cause septic arthritis as an extrapulmonary disease in immunosuppressed patients or chronic skin disease. Herein, we present a case of M. kansasii arthritis involving the elbow of an immunocompetent patient, which was initially suspected to be a soft-tissue tumor. A 70-year-old man presented with a swollen left elbow that had progressed for 18 months with deteriorating arthralgia and limited range of motion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed filling of the intra-articular space of the elbow and surrounding of the radial head with a soft tissue mass with mixed signal intensity. Initial incisional biopsy was performed via the lateral approach to the elbow joint, and pathological examination of the mass did not reveal any evidence of malignancy. One year after the first operation, arthroscopic surgery was performed to excise the mass following the recurrence of swelling and limited function of the elbow. Pathological examination of the resected synovium revealed epithelioid granulomas containing a multinucleated giant cell and inflammatory cell infiltration, characteristic of mycobacterial infection. M. kansasii was cultured after 2 weeks of incubation of the synovial sample. He experienced full resolution of the swelling and limited function following a combination of synovectomy and multidrug antimycobacterial treatment (rifampin 600 mg/day, clarithromycin 800 mg/day, and ethambutol 750 mg/day). This case highlights the need to consider this rare infection in the differential diagnosis of intra-articular soft tissue tumor-like lesions even in immunocompetent patients."

In recent studies, a few recent studies reported that NTM patients require preoperative treatment. In addition, some cases are found to be granuloma suspected to be NTM (gsNTM) after surgery. We conducted a clinico-bacteriological examination of resected NTM and gsNTM cases we managed. Methods: Between 2003 and 2017, 82 patients with NTM and gsNTM underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) biopsy at our institution. The objectives of surgery, perioperative treatment, progression of NTM and gsNTM, and bacteriological data were analyzed. Results: We enrolled 42 men and 40 women with a median age of 65 years. The bacteriological findings were Mycobacterium avium in 38 cases, M. intracellulare in 6 cases, M. kansasii in 3 cases, and gsNTM in 35 cases. The objectives of surgery were the diagnosis in 77 cases, and resistance to treatment in 6 cases. We performed postoperative treatment in 8 cases. There was no surgery-related (30-day mortality) death or complication. Conclusions: We analyzed surgical outcome for pulmonary NTM infections. We need to reconsider the surgical procedure for single pulmonary NTM lesion and whether adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary for NTM treatment."

Further analysis of 390 culture-positive cases demonstrated that 358 (358/390, 91.8%) were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), 24 (24/390, 6.2%) with NTM and eight (8/390, 2.0%) with both MTB and NTM. M. intracellulare was the most prevalent NTM isolated (16/24, 66.7%), followed by M. abscessus (3/24), M. kansasii (2/24), M. avium (1/24), M. szulgai (1/24) and M. fortuitum (1/24). The difference between NTM and TB case rates for the &gt;=65-year-old age group significantly exceeded the difference for the reference group (patients aged 25-44 years) (OR (95% CI): 4.63 (1.03-20.90)). Pulmonary NTM diseases incidence positively correlated with prior TB history (OR (95% CI): 12.92 (3.24-31.82)). Moreover, pulmonary NTM patients were significantly more likely to exhibit underlying bronchiectasis than pulmonary TB patients (OR (95% CI): 18.89 (7.54-47.88)). In conclusion, approximately one-tenth of culture-positive suspected pulmonary TB patients are infected with NTM (most frequently M. intracellulare) in Zhejiang Province, China. The elderly and those with bronchiectasis or a history of TB are at the greatest risk of contracting pulmonary NTM disease."

This cohort study determined the clinical characteristics and outcome of asymptomatic patients with NTM-SPN after surgical resection. Resected SPNs with culture-positive for NTM in six hospitals in Taiwan during January, 2010 to January, 2017 were identified. Asymptomatic patients without a history of NTM-pulmonary disease (PD) or same NTM species isolated from the respiratory samples were selected. All were followed until May 1, 2019. A total of 43 patients with NTM-SPN were enrolled. Mycobacterium avium complex (60%) and M. kansasii (19%) were the most common species. The mean age was 61.7 +- 13.4. Of them, 60% were female and 4% had history of pulmonary tuberculosis. The NTM-SPN was removed by wedge resection in 38 (88%), lobectomy in 3 (7%) and segmentectomy in 2 (5%). Caseating granuloma was the most common histologic feature (58%), while chronic inflammation accounts for 23%. Mean duration of the follow-up was 5.2 +- 2.8 years (median: 4.2 years [2.5-7.0]), there were no mycobacteriology recurrence or NTM-PD development. In conclusion, surgical resection is likely to curative for incidentally discovered NTM-SPN in asymptomatic patients without culture evidence of the same NTM species from respiratory specimens, and routine mycobacterium culture for resected SPN might be necessary for differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis and NTM because further treatment differs."

However, as yet, there are no such data relating to Tunisia. METHODS: Here we carried out a retrospective review of mycobacterial cultures originating from Northern Tunisia, which have been processed in the laboratory of mycobacteria of the Institut Pasteur de Tunis, during the time period 2002-2016. All pulmonary NTM (PNTM) isolates available for culture were characterized phenotypically and their taxonomic status was further established based on polymorphisms in rpoB, 16S rRNA, hsp65, and sodA DNA gene sequences. RESULTS: Of the 10,466 specimens collected from HIV-negative Tunisian patients with presumptive clinical pulmonary TB, 60 (0.6%) yielded PNTM isolates. An overall annual PNTM isolation prevalence of 0.2/100,000 was estimated. As far as could be ascertained, this isolation rate accounts amongst the lowest reported hitherto throughout the world. Among the 30 NTM isolates that were available for culture, 27 (90.0%) have been identified to the species level. The most commonly encountered species was Mycobacterium kansasii (23.3%) subtype 1. Strikingly, all M. kansasii cases were male patients originating from Bizerte, an industrialized region particularly known for iron industry. The remaining NTM species were M. fortuitum (16.6%), M. novocastrense (16.6%), M. chelonae (10.0%), M. gordonae (6.6%), M. gadium (6.6%), M. peregrinum (3.3%), M. porcinum (3.3%), and M. flavescens (3.3%). There were no bacteria of the M. avium complex, the most frequently isolated NTM globally, and the main driver of the rise of NTM-lung diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered an exceptional low prevalence of PNTM isolation among HIV-negative TB suspects in Northern Tunisia, suggesting a very low burden of NTM pulmonary disease. However, the frequent isolation of M. kansasii subtype 1, the most pathogenic subtype, particularly from the industrialized region of Bizerte, strongly suggests its effective involvement in a typical pulmonary disease."

These infections may also occur in previously immunocompetent patients with acquired anti-IFN-gamma antibodies (anti-IFN-gamma Abs). A previously healthy 33-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of cough and fever. Chest computed tomography showed air-space consolidation in the middle lobe of the right lung and enlargement of the supraclavicular, mediastinal, and hilar lymph nodes. Tissue samples obtained via mediastinoscopy showed granuloma formation with acid-fast bacteria; cultures from the tissue revealed Mycobacterium kansasii. Accordingly, a diagnosis of disseminated M. kansasii disease was made. The positive control tested negative in the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test, suggesting the presence of anti-IFN-gamma Abs. The ELISA test for anti-IFN-gamma Abs demonstrated an increased titer. Antimycobacterial drug treatments were initiated after diagnosis. His symptoms improved over 2 months, and he remains well on outpatient management. Disseminated M. kansasii disease is a very rare condition suggestive of immunosuppression.

The aim of the present study was to describe incidence rates of NTM lung disease and trends therein in our area over a 20-year period. This was a retrospective study of all cases of NTM lung disease between 1997 and 2016 that met the 2007 American Thoracic Society criteria. We analysed the annual incidence rates, species of mycobacteria isolated, trends over time and annual mortality in 327 patients. Mycobacterium kansasii was the most common mycobacterium isolated (84%), followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) (13%). We compared two periods: 1997-2006 (257 cases, 79%) and 2007-2016 (70 cases, 21%). The incidence rates tended to decrease across these years, with a peak of incidence in 2000 with 10.6 cases per 100 000.

They may be misdiagnosed and treated as PTB, often categorized as treatment failures if they do not respond to treatment. This manuscript aims to characterize patients with pulmonary NTM disease. METHODS: Patient characteristics of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary NTM disease, attending the ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai were prospectively compiled over a two-year period (2017-2018). RESULTS: A total of 122 patients with recurrent chest symptoms and not responding to anti-tuberculosis treatment were screened for NTM. Thirty-nine cases (26 males and 13 females) of symptomatic pulmonary NTM were diagnosed. The mean (SD) patient age and body mass index were 48.6 +- 11 years and 16.3 +- 3. All male participants were smokers, had at least one episode of previous ATT. Mycobacterium kansasii (48.7%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by Mycobacterium intracellulare (20.5%), Mycobacterium abscessus (7.6%) followed by Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kyorinense, and Mycobacterium simiae. Infection with multiple NTMs was seen in four patients. Isoniazid resistance was identified in 20 patients. Based on species identified, treatment was initiated as per American Thoracic Society guidelines and continued up to 12 months of culture negativity. CONCLUSIONS: M. kansasii is the commonest pulmonary NTM isolated in Tamilnadu with a higher prevalence in males and elderly. Sensitization of both patients and providers is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis of pulmonary NTM disease as pulmonary TB."

Clinical data were collected when the diagnosis was made and Chi-square test was used to compare the differences among 4 groups of patients. Bonferroni method was used for further pairwise comparisons. Results: There were significant differences among the 4 groups in the age(chi(2)=6.42, P&lt;0.001) and the gender(chi(2)=49.18, P&lt;0.001) of the patients. The history of bronchiectasis in the groups of M. Kansasii, M. Abscess, M. Intracellulare and M. Avium were 2/48, 31/46, 39/92 and 4/15 cases respectively(chi(2)=41.84, P&lt;0.001).

Kansasii, M. Abscess, M. Intracellulare and M. Avium). The drug resistance rates of M. Kansasii to rifampin, ethambutanol and ofloxacin were 10%(5/48), 8%(4/48) and 15%(7/48) respectively; the resistance rates of M.Intracellulare to ethambutanol was 45%(41/92), and the resistance rates of M.Abscess were all over 80% to all anti-TB drugs. The results of pairwise comparisons showed that the male proportion(46/48) and IGRAs positive rate(40/48) of patients with M. Kansasii were higher than those of other groups, and the incidence of bronchiectasis(20/48) and pleural changes(21/48) was lower than those of other groups. The female ratio(33/46), history of bronchiectasis (31/46) and tree-in-bud sign of patients(35/46) with M. Abscess were higher than those of other groups. Conclusions: There were differences in the clinical manifestations and imaging features of 4 common NMLD diseases, which were helpful for clinical differentiation. The patients with M. Kansasii infection were mainly male, with a high IGRA positive rate and fewer lesions of bronchiectasis or pleural changes. Most of the patients with M. Abscess were female, with a previous history of bronchiectasis, and with most of the lesions showing tree-in-bud signs. The NTM species had a high rate of resistance to anti-TB drugs except M.

This group of bacteria consists of at least 200 different species. While the pulmonary disease is the most common form of NTM infections, NTM can cause diffused infections as well as extrapulmonary infections in every organ, such as bone marrow, skin, eye, and brain. The NTM cause tuberculosis-like infections, therefore, correct identification of these Mycobacteria is necessary to avoid faulty treatment. Different species of NTM isolates were identified from clinical specimens using phenotypic methods and Line Probe Assay. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration for selected antibiotics was obtained by the broth micro-dilution method. Totally, 42 NTM isolates were identified in this study. Moreover, the frequency of NTM between all positive mycobacterium cultures was estimated at 12%. The most common Rapidly Growing Mycobacteria included Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (30.9%), Mycobacterium abscessus (7.1%), and Mycobacterium chelonae (2.3%), whereas Mycobacterium simiae (40.4%), Mycobacterium kansasii (16.6%), and Mycobacterium avium complex (2.3%) were the most recurring among the Slowly Growing Mycobacteria. Amikacin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against isolated NTM. The NTM isolates are frequently being separated from Iranian patients, and are mostly resistant to the wide spectrum of antibiotics. Correct identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility can be helpful in the healing process of the patients who suffer from non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections."

The disease shares clinicoradiological features with tuberculosis (TB), Nocardia and several fungal diseases, and its diagnosis is frequently delayed. The present study was performed to determine the frequency of NTM disease among TB suspects in a tertiary care centre in north India. Methods: In this prospective study, mycobacterial culture isolates from pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens among TB suspects were tested with immunochromatographic assay (ICA). All ICA-negative isolates were considered as NTM suspects and further subjected to 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer gene sequencing for confirmation and species identification. Patients with active disease were treated with drug regimen as per the identified NTM species. Follow up of patients was done to determine clinical, radiological and microbiological outcomes. Results: Of the 5409 TB suspects, 42 (0.77%) were diagnosed with NTM disease. Patients with active disease consenting for treatment were treated and followed up. Thirty four patients had NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) and the remaining eight had extrapulmonary NTM (EP-NTM) disease. Mycobacterium intracellulare and M. abscessus, respectively, were most frequently isolated from NTM-PD and EP-NTM patients. Fifteen NTM-PD and seven EP-NTM patients successfully completed the treatment. Ten patients died due to unrelated causes, five were lost to follow up and another four declined the treatment. Interpretation &amp; conclusions: Our study showed that the frequency of NTM disease was low among TB suspects at a large tertiary care centre in north India and this finding was similar to other Indian studies. More studies need to be done in other parts of the country to know the geographical variation in NTM disease, if any."

The aim of our study was to describe the frequency and diversity of NTM species in our region and their distribution according to the source sample, gender, and age of the patients. We performed a multicenter study of all NTM isolated in 24 public hospitals in Madrid from 2013 to 2017. A total of 6.923 mycobacteria were isolated: 4535 (65.5%) NTM, and 2.388 (34.5%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB). Overall, 61 different NTM species were identified. The most frequently isolated species were Mycobacterium avium complex (47.7%), M. lentiflavum (12.2%), M. gordonae (9.2%), M. fortuitum (8.9%), and M. abscessus (3.9%). Whereas MTB cases were stable during the study period, the number of NTM isolates increased considerably from 930 isolates in 2013 to 1012 in 2017; a sharp increase occurred in the last year. The rise in NTM isolates was mostly due to M. lentiflavum, M. kansasii, and M. abscessus mainly isolated from respiratory specimens in patients older than 60. The increase in isolation rate of NTM in our region is consistent with the increasing rates reported worldwide in the last decades. The rise in NTM isolates was mainly attributed to M. lentiflavum but it also should be noted the increasing of species with high pathogenic potential such as M. kansasii and M. abscessus."

In order to explore NTM-LD outcomes in a real-life setting, an observational, retrospective study enrolling consecutive adults who received treatment for NTM-LD in Milan, Italy, from 2007 to 2017 was conducted. Among 170 patients (68.2% females; median age: 68 years), NTM-LD was mainly due to M. avium complex (MAC) (71.2%), M. kansasii (9.4%) and M. xenopi (7.1%). Along a median follow-up of 31 months, adverse events occurred in 37.6% of the patients. Treatment outcomes of the entire study population included an unsuccessful outcome in 35.3% of the patients, including treatment halted in 13.5%, recurrence in 11.2%, re-infection in 5.3%, treatment failure in 4.1% and relapse in 1.2%. The main reason for treatment halted was drug intolerance. No differences were detected between patients with MAC-LD vs. those with other NTM-LD in terms of unsuccessful outcome in general (35.5% vs. 34.7%). A significantly higher prevalence of patients who underwent treatment halted was found in patients with NTM-LD other than MAC in comparison to patients with MAC-LD (22.4% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.030). One third of adults undergoing treatment for a NTM-LD experiences an unsuccessful outcome with adverse events and treatment discontinuation being major challenges in patients' management."

The disease activity increases with progressive immunodeficiency. Methods: A total of 216 HIV seropositive patients suspected of having mycobacterial infection were recruited for this study. Clinical samples were collected from each patient and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen media. Detection and species identification were simultaneously done using Reverse Blot Hybridization Assay System. Also, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for each isolate were determined in 7H9 broth media for 10 antibiotics. Results: In this study, 4 rapid and 4 slow-growing NTM species were isolated and identified. Mycobacterium fortuitum was the most common NTM species, 3/8 (37.5%), followed by Mycobacterium kansasii, 2/8 (25%). The cases were identified as pulmonary disease, 5/8 (62.5 %), disseminated infection, 2/8 (25%), and skin abscess, 1/8 (12.5%). M. chelonae and Mycobacterium avium were isolated from patients diagnosed with disseminated infection with treatment failure. The skin abscess was caused by infection with M. simiae. The results of the MIC testing were as follows: M. kansasii and M. fortuitum were susceptible to amikacin (AMK); M. avium to clarithromycin (CLA); M. fortuitum 2/3 (67%) to ciprofloxacin (CIP); 1/2 (50%) of M. kansasii isolates to CLA, and M. chelonae to rifampin (RIF), linezolid (LIN), AMK, and CIP at medium and high concentrations.

This study is conducted to understand management and outcomes of patients with pulmonary NTM disease at diverse centers across the US. METHODS: We conducted a 10-year (2005-2015) retrospective study at seven Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units to evaluate pulmonary NTM treatment outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus-negative adults. Demographic and clinical information were abstracted through medical record review. Microbiologic and clinical cure were evaluated using previously defined criteria. RESULTS: Of 297 patients diagnosed with pulmonary NTM, the most frequent NTM species were Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (83.2%), M. kansasii (7.7%), and M. abscessus (3.4%). Two hundred forty-five (82.5%) patients received treatment, while 45 (15.2%) were followed without treatment. Eighty-six patients had available drug susceptibility results; of these, >40% exhibited resistance to rifampin, ethambutol, or amikacin. Of the 138 patients with adequate outcome data, 78 (56.5%) experienced clinical and/or microbiologic cure. Adherence to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) treatment guidelines was significantly more common in patients who were cured (odds ratio [OR] 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-10.4, P < 0.001). Overall mortality was 15.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite ATS/IDSA Guidelines, management of pulmonary NTM disease was heterogeneous and cure rates were relatively low. Further work is required to understand which patients are suitable for monitoring without treatment and the impact of antimicrobial therapy on pulmonary NTM morbidity and mortality."

In this study, our objective was to assess the efficiency of mycobacterial culture plus DNA sequencing to detect the mixed infections with MTB and various NTM organisms. We also aimed to investigate how efficiently GeneXpert detected MTB in mixed infections with NTM in in vitro models. METHODS: A serial of mixed infection samples was generated by combining suspensions of MTB and five NTM bacteria, respectively. The mixed suspensions were further detected with GeneXpert and liquid culture plus DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the GeneXpert assay exhibited promising capability to identify the presence of MTB at different proportions ranging from 1% to 99%. For the liquid culture, the subsequent DNA sequencing only detected the presence of NTM bacteria in the mixed samples, which the proportion of NTM ranged from 1% to 99%, including M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. abscessus, and M. fortuitum. For M. avium, DNA sequencing was able to identify the mixtures as M. avium infection in suspensions with no less than 10% M. avium bacteria, whereas only MTB was found in the other suspensions with less M. avium bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the current diagnostic algorithm cannot yield a precise detection of mixed infections with MTB and NTM bacteria. The GeneXpert assay only identify MTB in the mixed samples, while the subculture plus DNA sequencing prefers to identify the NTM species with the higher growth rate. Further targeted molecular analysis by specific capture of multiple loci of mycobacterial species from specimens is urgently required to solve this diagnostic dilemma."

The aims of this study were to identify NTM in patients with suspected tuberculosis who presented positive cultures and to evaluate the genetic diversity of strains identified as Mycobacterium avium. METHODS: We studied pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples obtained from 1,248 patients. The samples that tested positive on culture and negative for the M. tuberculosis complex by molecular identification techniques were evaluated by detection of the hsp65 and rpoB genes and sequencing of conserved fragments of these genes. All strains identified as M. avium were genotyped using the eight-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem-repeat method. RESULTS: We found that NTM accounted for 25 (7.5%) of the 332 mycobacteria isolated. Of those 25, 18 (72%) were M. avium, 5 (20%) were M. abscessus, 1 (4%) was M. gastri, and 1 (4%) was M. kansasii. The 18 M. avium strains showed high diversity, only two strains being genetically related. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the need to consider the investigation of NTM in patients with suspected active tuberculosis who present with positive cultures, as well as to evaluate the genetic diversity of M. avium strains."

The clinical, imaging and histopathologic features, bacteriologic data and morphologic characteristics of acid fast bacilli (AFB) were analyzed retrospectively. Specific gene sequence IS6110 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was detected by fluorescence PCR. Identification of Mycobacteria was by melting curve method. Fifty cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were selected in the same period as control. Results: The NTM lung cases included 18 cases (40.0%, 18/45) of M. intracellulare, eight cases (17.8%, 8/45) of M. xenopi, six cases (13.3%, 6/45) of M. avium, six cases (13.3%, 6/45) of M. kansasii, six cases (13.3%, 6/45) of M. chelonae and one case (2.2%, 1/45) of M. simiae. Histopathologically, there were necrotizing granulomas in 34 cases (75.6%, 34/45), non-necrotizing granuloma in one case (2.2%, 1/45) and non-granulomatous lesions in 10 cases (22.2%, 10/45). The necrosis was pink necrosis, basophilic necrosis rich in nuclear fragments and suppurative necrosis. Pulmonary TB showed more pink necrosis and basophilic necrosis, the difference was statistically significant (chi(2)=10.270, P=0.001; chi(2)=7.449, P=0.006). Seventeen cases (37.8%, 17/45) of NTM lung disease showed giant multinucleated giant cells, which were significantly different from those in pulmonary tuberculosis group (chi(2)=13.446, P<0.01). The number and morphology of AFB were also different. More AFB were found in M. intracellular cases and significant AFB were easily seen in M. kansasii infection. Conclusions: M. tuberculosis and NTM cannot be reliably differentiated by histologic features or by AFB morphology. Molecular assays are important to distinguish tuberculosis from NTM lung disease."

Both the frequency of M. kansasii isolates and global prevalence of M. kansasii-LD have increased gradually over recent decades. Treatment of M. kansasii-LD is recommended because of the disease's poor prognosis and fatal outcome. The decision on the optimal time point for treatment initiation should be based on both the benefits and risks posed by multiple antimicrobial agents. For treatment-naive patients with M. kansasii-LD, rifampin-containing multiple antimicrobial regimens for >=12 months after culture negative conversion are effective. However, some challenges remain, such as determining the precise length of treatment duration as well as addressing intolerable adverse effects, the uncertain effectiveness of isoniazid and ethambutol in treatment, the uncertain correlation between in vitro drug susceptibility testing and clinical outcomes, and the increasing prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant M. kansasii isolates. Short-course and effective therapies must be developed. New candidate drugs, such as tedizoid and clofazimine, exhibit excellent antimycobacterial activity against M. kansasii in vitro, but in vivo studies of their clinical applications are lacking.

Among them, Mycobacterium kansasii (M. kansasii) causes both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infections. Despite the high prevalence of M. kansasii isolates in Iran, unfortunately little is known about the epidemiological aspects of M. kansasii infection. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular identification, determination of subtypes variation and geographic distribution of clinical isolates of M. kansasii isolates. Methods: In the present study, 108 clinical pulmonary isolates suspected to NTM were collected from four Tuberculosis Regional Reference Laboratories in Iran during 2016-2018. The isolates were confirmed as NTM using conventional and molecular methods. Among them, M. kansasii isolates were subjected to rpoB gene sequencing. For determination of subtyping of M. kansasii isolates, polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme analysis (PCR-REA) based on the hsp65 gene was performed. Results: Based on the rpoB gene sequence analysis, 33 (30.5%) isolates were identified as M. kansasii species, compared to 31 (28.7%) isolates using phenotypic methods. The subtype I was the most frequent subtype (n=24; 72.7%), followed by subtype II (n=8; 24.2%). Conclusion: We indicated that the rate of M. kansasii isolation with clinical significance appears to be increasing in Iran, especially in highly industrialized cities. The high rate of M. kansasii subtype I may suggest that this genotype has a particular potency for colonization, and a higher epidemiological potential for causing infection in humans.

NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM) LUNG DISEASE:  Especially in patients with microscopic detection of acid-fast bacteria in sputum or with cavernous disease manifestation, the start of treatment should not be delayed. Treatment should be based on species-specific resistance testing (according to the CLSI guidelines). In selected patients, adjuvant surgical resection after consultation with an expert is recommended. MAC LUNG DISEASE:  Therapy is based on a regimen with at least three drugs including a macrolide (rather azithromycin than clarithromycin) and ethambutol. For patients with cavitation, with pronounced nodular bronchiectatic disease or with macrolide resistance, daily oral therapy should be expanded by parenteral amikacin or streptomycin. Liposomally encapsulated amikacin for inhalation is recommended in patients with treatment failure. Patients with nodular-bronchiectatic disease manifestation should receive oral macrolide-based therapy, which - depending on the extent - can be given 3 times a week. The recommended duration is 12 months after conversion of the sputum culture. M. KANSASII LUNG DISEASE:  The triple combination of rifampicin, ethambutol and macrolide (or isoniazid) is recommended for at least 12 months. In patients with rifampicin resistance or intolerance, moxifloxacin is recommended as a replacement. M. XENOPI LUNG DISEASE:  The combination of rifampicin, ethambutol and macrolide (and/or moxifloxacin) is recommended for at least 12 months after conversion of the sputum culture. For patients with cavernous disease manifestation, it is recommended to add at least parenteral amikacin and to consult experts. M. ABSCESSUS LUNG DISEASE:  At least 3, in the beginning rather 4 drugs are recommended for therapy. The choice of substance should be based on a in vitro resistance test. Macrolides are the basis, but should not be counted in patients with strains with inducible macrolide resistance. Due to the lack of data, no explicit recommendations are made regarding the duration of therapy; a consultation of experts is recommended."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic validity of gastric aspirate culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). METHODS: Gastric aspirates were collected from patients with suspected NTM-PD at the Osaka Toneyama Medical Center between December 2006 and February 2018. Patients with a final diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, an observation period less than six months, or less than three conducted sputum cultures were excluded from the study. NTM-PD was diagnosed as per ATS/IDSA criteria. We retrospectively examined the diagnostic validity of gastric aspirate culture in Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-PD and M. kansasii-PD by comparing culture results with final diagnoses. This was done first for all patients, and subsequently for patients with negative results for early sputum cultures. In addition, we compared the time required for an NTM-PD diagnosis based on gastric aspiration to that based on ATS/IDSA criteria. RESULTS: Among 475 total patients, 119 (25.1%) had positive NTM gastric aspirate cultures and 154 (32.4%) fulfilled the ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM-PD. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPVs) of gastric aspiration were 63.9%, 95.8%, 83.5%, and 88.8% in MAC-PD and 82.4%, 99.6%, 87.5%, and 99.3% in M. kansasii-PD, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of gastric aspirate cultures of the 378 patients who were undiagnosed based on sputum culture within 120 days were 34.0%, 95.5%, 51.6%, and 91.1% for MAC-PD and 75.0%, 99.5%, 60.0%, and 99.7% for M. kansasii-PD, respectively. Furthermore, gastric aspirate cultures tested in addition to bronchoscopy yielded incremental sensitivity of 8.7% (95.7% vs. 87.0%) and an NPV of 1.3% (99.3% vs. 98.0%) in MAC-PD. In NTM-PD patients with NTM-positive gastric aspirate cultures, the period between gastric aspirate collection and the positive culture result was shorter than the time between gastric aspirate collection and NTM-PD diagnosis [6 (9, 36) days vs. 25 (12, 69) days, median (IQR), p < 0.0001].

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium kansasiiID:33107481TITLE:Epidemiology, diagnosis & treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases.ABSTRACT:Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitously present in the environment, but NTM diseases occur infrequently. NTM are generally considered to be less virulent than Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, these organisms can cause diseases in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. As compared to tuberculosis, person-to-person transmission does not occur except with M. abscessus NTM species among cystic fibrosis patients. Lung is the most commonly involved organ, and the NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) occurs frequently in patients with pre-existing lung disease. NTM may also present as localized disease involving extrapulmonary sites such as lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues and rarely bones. Disseminated NTM disease is rare and occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired immune defects such as HIV/AIDS. Rapid molecular tests are now available for confirmation of NTM diagnosis at species and subspecies level. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) is not routinely done except in non-responsive disease due to slowly growing mycobacteria ( M. avium complex, M. kansasii) or infection due to rapidly growing mycobacteria, especially M. abscessus. While the decision to treat the patients with NTM-PD is made carefully, the treatment is given for 12 months after sputum culture conversion. Additional measures include pulmonary rehabilitation and correction of malnutrition. Treatment response in NTM-PD is variable and depends on isolated NTM species and severity of the underlying PD. Surgery is reserved for patients with localized disease with good pulmonary functions. Future research should focus on the development and validation of non-culture-based rapid diagnostic tests for early diagnosis and discovery of newer drugs with greater efficacy and lesser toxicity than the available ones."

Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and February 2019, 18 cases of NTM were diagnosed and their relevant clinical, diagnostic, and treatment details were recorded after taking informed consent. Results: We report 18 cases of NTM involving lungs (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), joint (n = 2), genitourinary (n = 1), and central nervous system (n = 1). History of immunosuppression was present in two patients, whereas history of some form of intervention was seen in six patients. Mycobacterium fortuitum group (n = 5) was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 4), Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 3), Mycobacterium kansasii (n = 2), and Mycobacterium chelonae (n = 1). In two patients, M. chelonae and M. abscessus were isolated in succession. Of these 18 patients, clinical response was present in 15 of the patients. Diagnosis and treatment of NTM in resource limited settings is extremely challenging. Conclusion: Most of the patients with NTM are misdiagnosed and are treated as tuberculosis in India, sometimes with a multidrug resistance regimen, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. We present these cases to shed some light on the epidemiology of NTM in this part of India."

Mycobacterium kansasii, a slow-growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria, causes disease in both humans and animals. While infections have been well described in humans, where it may be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, there are fewer reports in animals. Only four cases have been reported in the domestic cat. This case report describes systemic M. kansasii infection in two sibling indoor-only cats that presented two and half years apart with cutaneous disease that was found to be associated with osteolytic and pulmonary pathology. Infection with M. kansasii was confirmed in both cats by polymerase chain reaction on fine-needle aspirate of a lumbosacral soft tissue mass in one cat and on a tissue punch biopsy of a skin lesion in the other; interferon-gamma release assay inferred M. avium-complex and M. tuberculosis-complex infection in the two cats, respectively. Both patients made a full recovery following antimicrobial therapy with rifampicin, azithromycin, and pradofloxacin (plus N-acetyl cysteine in cat 2). This report highlights successful treatment of systemic M. kansasii mycobacteriosis in the cat and the challenge of accurately diagnosing this infection."

In patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cavitation is an uncommon manifestation of a common disease. It is unusual in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis but occurs frequently in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, cavities are more common during earlier stages of HIV disease, when cellular immunity is relatively preserved. Mycobacterium avium complex is an uncommon cause of lung disease and infrequently produces cavities. However, Mycobacterium kansasii, is often associated with cavitation. Cavities can complicate any bacterial pneumonia and are especially common with pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia asteroides, and Rhodococcus equi. Noninfectious causes of cavitary lesions are rare, but cavitary lesions caused by pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been reported. Because of the broad differential diagnosis and because most cavities are caused by treatable opportunistic infections, a definitive diagnosis is essential."

Six of the 8 were men, and two were women. The mean age was 36.5 years. Six were Japanese, one was from Myanmar, and one was Malaysian. The median CD4 positive T lymphocyte counts (CD4 count) at the time of diagnosis of the M. tuberculosis was 75.5 (range 14-569/microliter, and the M. kansasii was 21.5 (range 19-24)/microliter. Clinical findings and symptoms of all patients were non-specific, but almost all patients had a cough and fever. In the radiographic findings, the patients of the M. tuberculosis group presented multiple hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, miliary shadow, and obstructive pneumonia. Both M. kansasii patients showed a multiple infiltration shadow. There were no drug resistant strains in M. tuberculosis except on isolate with moderate resistant. to Streptomycin. These observations suggest that AIDS-associated mycobacterial disease shows atypical clinical and radiological features in some cases, especially in advanced stages of AIDS.

Although M. avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare can be identified with expensive, commercially available probes, many MAC isolates remain unresolved, including those representing Mycobacterium lentiflavum as well as other potentially undefined species. PCR restriction analysis (PRA) of the hsp65 gene has been proposed as a rapid and inexpensive approach. We applied PRA to 278 MAC isolates, including 126 from blood of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, 59 from sputum of HIV-negative patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 88 from environmental sources, and 5 pulmonary isolates from a different study. A total of 15 different PRA patterns were observed. For 27 representative isolates, a 441-bp fragment of the hsp65 gene was sequenced; based on 54 polymorphic sites, 18 different alleles were defined, including 12 alleles not previously reported. Species and phylogenetic relationships were more accurately defined by sequencing than by PRA or commercial probe. The distribution of PRA types and, by implication, phylogenetic lineages among blood isolates was significantly different from that for pulmonary and environmental isolates, suggesting that particular lineages have appreciably greater virulence and invasive potential."

RESULTS: From 192 reports, data were received on 153 cases (response rate: 79.7%). Of these, 102 met inclusion criteria. The median age was 2.9 years. Predisposing conditions were infrequent and included chronic respiratory disease (n = 12) and immunosuppression (n = 6). Lymphadenitis was the most frequent presentation (n = 68) with pulmonary and disseminated disease infrequent (n = 14 and 3, respectively). NTM was isolated in 68 cases with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex most frequently isolated (33/68; 48.5%). Surgery was performed in 78 cases and 42 children were treated with antimycobacterial therapy. Twenty-five subjects received surgery and antimycobacterial therapy. Follow-up data were available for 77 children with recurrence observed in 18 cases. Complete excision was associated with a higher rate of treatment success when compared with all other therapies (OR: 9.48 [95% CI: 2.00-44.97], P = 0.001).

Previous reports have demonstrated that cervical lymphadenitis of children is the most frequent pathology of M. lentiflavum. However, there are little reports regarding pulmonary diseases by M. lentiflavum specifically in immunocompetent patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man having prolonged productive cough and dyspnea with fever was initially diagnosed as pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. Imaging studies showed that the radiologic abnormality was acute bronchopneumonic infiltration with abscess formation in the left lower lobe and parapneumonic pleural effusion. M. lentiflavum was identified in the cultured pleural tissues. On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed as pulmonary infection and pleurisy caused by M. lentiflavum, which was treated with a combination of antibiotics covering NTM. His clinical manifestations were dramatically improved by the treatment targeting NTM, while those were refractory to empirical antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: In this report, we introduce the isolation of M. lentiflavum from pleural tissues associated with acute necrotizing pneumonia combined with parapneumonic effusion in an immunocompetent host, suggesting that the M. lentiflavum can be a human pathogen invovled in pulmonary infectious diseases and pleurisy with poor response to empirical antibiotic treatment."

Understanding of the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics associated with NTM disease is needed to refine diagnostic and treatment strategies, particularly among the less commonly isolated species. OBJECTIVES: To improve knowledge of geographic variance of NTM species, to correlate detailed clinical information with isolation of specific NTM, and to examine the decision to treat and outcomes for specific NTM. METHODS: Mycobacterial cultures submitted to the University of Washington mycobacterial laboratory from 1998 to 2011 were examined. We report isolation frequency and demographic information from all samples with clinical variables. We also examined treatment decisions and outcomes in a subset of patients with Mycobacterium abscessus complex, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium lentiflavum, Mycobacterium porcinum, and Mycobacterium xenopi. RESULTS: Cultures of NTM were available from 3,470 patients, 937 of whom had clinical data available. When we compared patients born within or outside Washington State, we found that the mycobacterial species frequency varied. Among 168 patients with one of the studied environmental mycobacteria, 72% had major comorbid conditions. Bronchiectasis was common among patients with pulmonary isolation of any NTM, including those with nonpathogenic M. gordonae. Although mortality was high (37%), few deaths were directly attributable to mycobacterial infection. Among 56 patients who met American Thoracic Society criteria for NTM lung disease, 22 were treated, and 19 of those had M. abscessus complex and M. kansasii. The treatment regimens used tended to follow published guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation of NTM varied by geographic region of origin and location within Washington State. Several clinical risk factors were specific to individual species. Comorbid conditions were common in patients with and without mycobacterial disease. Among patients with one of the studied organisms, there was a high mortality rate more frequently related to comorbid conditions than to mycobacterial disease."

However, little is known about the clinical importance of pulmonary infection with M. lentiflavum in adults. METHODS: The medical records of all adults who met the diagnostic criteria of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease at Keio University Hospital and Fukujuji Hospital from 2001 to 2015 were reviewed. In addition, the PubMed database was searched to identify further reported cases in non-HIV adults. RESULTS: Five cases of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease were identified in the medical records search and 11 additional cases were identified in the literature review. Eleven of the total 16 cases were female, and 15 of 16 cases showed a nodular/bronchiectatic pattern on chest computed tomography imaging. No cases showed an aggressive clinical course of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease, although one patient died of an exacerbation of underlying vasculitis and bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of pulmonary M. lentiflavum disease in adult patients were identified. This disease mainly affects females, displays a nodular/bronchiectatic pattern on chest computed tomography imaging, and does not demonstrate an aggressive clinical course. Further larger studies are needed to reveal detailed clinical features."

The aim of our study was to describe the frequency and diversity of NTM species in our region and their distribution according to the source sample, gender, and age of the patients. We performed a multicenter study of all NTM isolated in 24 public hospitals in Madrid from 2013 to 2017. A total of 6.923 mycobacteria were isolated: 4535 (65.5%) NTM, and 2.388 (34.5%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB). Overall, 61 different NTM species were identified. The most frequently isolated species were Mycobacterium avium complex (47.7%), M. lentiflavum (12.2%), M. gordonae (9.2%), M. fortuitum (8.9%), and M. abscessus (3.9%). Whereas MTB cases were stable during the study period, the number of NTM isolates increased considerably from 930 isolates in 2013 to 1012 in 2017; a sharp increase occurred in the last year. The rise in NTM isolates was mostly due to M. lentiflavum, M. kansasii, and M. abscessus mainly isolated from respiratory specimens in patients older than 60. The increase in isolation rate of NTM in our region is consistent with the increasing rates reported worldwide in the last decades. The rise in NTM isolates was mainly attributed to M. lentiflavum but it also should be noted the increasing of species with high pathogenic potential such as M. kansasii and M. abscessus."

AIDS in Africa has certain characteristic presentations. Enteropathic AIDS is most common: Cryptosporidium and Isospora belli are identified in up to 60% of patients, but it is uncertain whether they are the causes of diarrhoea. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is rare. Tuberculosis, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary, is the supreme complicating infection. Herpes zoster is frequently the first clinical presentation, and has a 95% positive predictive value for HIV positivity. Measles may be more frequent in infants born to HIV-infected mothers, and appears to be worse in HIV-infected children. There is accelerated progress of both diseases in patients infected by HIV and Mycobacterium leprae. Salmonellosis is frequent. There is no direct interaction between malaria and HIV, but, by being a potent cause of anaemia, malaria enhances transmission of HIV to children through blood transfusion. HIV-positive subjects are liable to new or reactivated visceral leishmaniasis with dissemination to unusual sites. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is common. There are no apparent interactions between HIV and helminths, although there is one report of hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis. Cryptococcal meningitis has high frequency. Infections with Histoplasma encapsulatum are common in tropical America, but there has been no increase of frequency of H. duboisii in Africa since the advent of AIDS."

Although both diseases are prevalent in clusters in developing countries, simultaneous occurrence of them in an individual is a rare entity, even in an endemic setting. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe six cases of tuberculosis and leprosy coinfection: a 57-year-old Sinhalese woman, a 47-year-old Tamil woman, a 72-year-old Tamil man, a 59-year-old Sinhalese man, a 54-year-old Sinhalese man, and a 50-year-old Sinhalese man. In this case series, five patients had lepromatous leprosy and the majority of patients were men. Three patients were detected to have tuberculosis at the outset of treatment of leprosy, while two developed tuberculosis later and one had extrapulmonary tuberculosis 5 years before the diagnosis of leprosy. The latter developed pulmonary tuberculosis as a reactivation while on treatment for leprosy. A majority of our patients with pulmonary tuberculosis had positive Mantoux test, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, radiological evidence, and acid-fast bacilli in sputum. Human immunodeficiency virus and diabetes were detected in one patient. One patient had rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, while she was on monthly rifampicin therapy for leprosy. CONCLUSION: An immunocompromised status, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, diabetes, and immunosuppressive drugs, are risk factors for tuberculosis infection. The use of steroids in the treatment of leprosy may increase the susceptibility to develop tuberculosis. Development of rifampicin resistance secondary to monthly rifampicin in leprosy is a major concern in treating patients coinfected with tuberculosis. Despite the paucity of reports of coinfection, it is advisable to screen for tuberculosis in patients with leprosy, especially if there are respiratory or constitutional symptoms, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and abnormal chest X-ray. The fact is that positive Mantoux and QuantiFERON Gold tests and presence of acid-fast bacilli in sputum are misleading, chest X-ray evidence of active tuberculosis and positive tuberculosis cultures are important diagnostic clues for active tuberculosis infection in a patient with leprosy. This is important to avoid monthly rifampicin in patients with suspected coinfections, which may lead to development of drug resistance to tuberculosis treatment. Whether prolonged steroid therapy in leprosy is a risk factor for development of tuberculosis is still controversial."

To evaluate an alternative method of diagnosis, the distribution of mycobacterial antigens in lung tissue specimens was characterized by an indirect peroxidase-antiperoxidase method and was compared to the detection of AFB by Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Histologic specimens were obtained from 59 hospital patients. Of nine patients with mycobacterial disease, seven had antigen detected in tissue. In two patients with tuberculous pneumonia, the distribution of mycobacterial antigens was approximately the same as that of AFB. In contrast, in four patients with caseating pulmonary granulomas, clumps of mycobacterial antigens were demonstrated in necrotic areas of the granulomas where there were few or no AFB. In one patient with Mycobacterium intracellulare infection, cross-reactive antigens stained weakly. Antigen was not found in tissue from two patients; one had miliary lung granulomas, and the second had mediastinal lymph node granulomas. Mycobacterial antigens were not detected in specimens from 50 control patients with nonmycobacterial diseases. On the basis of this study of 59 cases, immunohistochemical detection of microbial antigens appears to be useful for establishing the mycobacterial etiology of caseating pulmonary granulomas."

According to National Leprosy Eradication Programme 2017-18 annual report, the annual new case detection rate from Rajasthan is 1.27 per 1 lakh population and prevalence rate is 0.14. Aims and Objective: The main objective of this study was to determine the spectrum of Mycobacterium leprae infections among suspected cases attending a teaching hospital in western Rajasthan, India. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in the Department of Microbiology, in a teaching hospital, western Rajasthan, between the period of January 2017 and April 2019. The records of modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining during the study period were analyzed. The demographic data like age and sex along with clinical diagnosis were also recorded from laboratory register and hospital information system. Results: Out of total 91 suspected cases, 30.77% was microbiologically confirmed cases of leprosy. Out of total positive cases, 71.43% were male and 28.57% were female. A maximum number of positive (50%) were found in the age group of 31-50 years. Conclusion: Present study gives an insight about the spectrum of leprosy in the region. The large number of positive cases signifies that leprosy awareness and programs aimed at elimination need to be more vigorously implemented. To achieve complete eradication from this menace, newer strategies like effective vaccine development and drug-resistance testing should be implemented."

The incidence of tuberculosis in France is 8/100,000 inhabitants and there are very few accounts of association of these two mycobacteria. Herein we report a case of co-infection with borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy and disseminated tuberculosis diagnosed in metropolitan France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A male subject presented with diffuse painless infiltrated erythematous plaques. The biopsy revealed perisudoral and perineural lymphohistiocytic epithelioid cell granuloma as well as acid-alcohol-fast bacilli on Ziehl staining. PCR was positive for Mycobacterium leprae, confirming the diagnosis of leprosy in the BT form. The staging examination revealed predominantly lymphocytic left pleural effusion, right-central necrotic adenopathy without histological granuloma, negative screening for BK, a positive QuantiFERON-TB  test, and a positive intradermal tuberculin reaction. The clinical and radiological results militated in favour of disseminated tuberculosis. Combined therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) together with clofazimine resulted in regression of both cutaneous and extra-cutaneous lesions. This rare co-infection combines leprosy, often present for several years, and tuberculosis (usually pulmonary) of subsequent onset. The pathophysiological hypothesis is that of cross-immunity (with anti-TB immunity protecting against subsequent leprosy and vice versa), supported by the inverse correlation of the two levels of prevalence and by the protection afforded by tuberculosis vaccination. In most cases, treatment for TB and leprosy improves both diseases. Patients presenting leprosy should be screened for latent tuberculosis in order to avoid reactivation, particularly in cases where corticosteroid treatment is being given."

As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. leprae-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection have yet to be fully investigated. The goal of the present viewpoint is to describe some of the similarities that may be found between COVID-19 and leprosy disease in the context of neutrophilic biology."

A recent multicentre trial conducted by the British Thoracic Society provided an opportunity to prospectively document the clinical features and response to treatment of this relatively rare but challenging disease in a substantial number of patients. When two positive cultures were confirmed by the Mycobacterium Reference Units for England, Wales, Scotland or Scandinavia, the coordinating physician invited the patient's physician to enrol the patient, who was then treated on a random basis with either rifampicin plus ethambutol or rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid for 2 yrs. Clinical, bacteriological and radiological progress were monitored at set intervals for 5 yrs. In over 5 yrs a total of 106 patients were recruited to the study. The mean age was 58 yrs, range 24-89 A total of 58% were male and just over half previously or at the time ofthe study had other lung diseases. Sputum was positive on direct smear in 58%. Cavitation was seen on the chest radiographs of 74%, the majority having cavities of &gt; or = 2 cm in diameter. Less than half of the patients showed bilateral disease, 26% having involvement of more than three lung zones. Disease was confined to the upper zone(s) in 30%. Other lung diseases were evident in 52%. Although clinical response was judged satisfactory at most reviews (90%), one in three patients died within 5 yrs and &lt;5% were thought to have died primarily because of M. malmoense. There were three failures of treatment and eight relapses after the end of treatment. There was no correlation between failure of treatment/relapse and in vitro resistance. A total of 63 (59%) of patients were alive at 5 yrs, of whom 44 (42% of the total entry) were known to be cured. Pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium malmoense is a serious condition that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The results of standard susceptibility tests do not correlate with the bacteriological response of the disease to chemotherapy. Rifampicin and ethambutol, with or without isoniazid, cured only 42% of patients but were better tolerated than previously described, more complex regimens of equal or lesser efficacy. There is a need for more effective regimens that will reduce mortality and failure of treatment/relapse rates, but, in addition, attention should be directed at improving management of comorbid conditions and improving the general health of the patient."

This previously undescribed mycobacterial species was isolated from five different patients with symptomatic pulmonary infections. All isolates were acid-fast-positive and the mycolic acid profiles were unique and supported placement into the genus Mycobacterium. Phenotypic characteristics of each strain included optimal growth after 3 weeks at a temperature range of 30-35 degrees C, yellow pigmentation after incubation in the dark and production of a heat-stable catalase. The 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences were identical for all five strains, but distinct from all known mycobacterial species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the novel species within the slowly growing mycobacteria group in close proximity to Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum.

We encountered a case of M. malmoense infectious lung disease which could be cured by surgical operation without chemotherapy. M. malmoense strains were isolated in both the bronchial washing lavage and the removed lung specimen, and it were identified using 16S rRNA gene and rpoB gene sequencing. This case might indicate that pulmonary infectious disease caused by a rare non-tuberculous mycobacteria pathogen should be positively considered to be treated surgically as an initial therapy when the patient's condition is admissive, and also indicated the importance of identification of the causative pathogen from surgical specimens. In addition, this was the second report of M. malmoense infectious disease, and the first case of surgical treatment case of M. malmoense lung disease in Japan, as far as we could determine."

The clinical and radiological picture is non-specific. The infection develops most frequently in a dystrophic lung. CASE REPORT: A patient of 52 years was admitted with an extensive multifocal pneumonia which later proved to be due to infection with MM. Empirical treatment was started with the combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide (rifater) and ethambutol (myambutol). Subsequently, cultures showed sensitivity to rifampicin, ethambutol, oxfloxacin, clarithromycin (MIC &lt; 2 mg/l) and rifabutin (MIC &lt; 0.5 mg/l). More than two weeks after the start of treatment, material aspirated at fibroscopy showed the persistence of numerous acid-alcohol fast bacilli, an increase, compared with the original examination, from 5 to 25 per field on day 2, to 20 to 100 per field on day 19. Despite the late addition of clarithromycin there was a progressive deterioration in the pulmonary condition. CONCLUSION: There is little correlation between the in vivo and in vitro sensitivities of MM to antibiotics. In our patient the progress was unfavourable, even though the mycobacterium was sensitive to the combination of antibiotics used, with the exception of isoniazid that was not tested. In vitro isoniazid does not seem to be active against MM. There is no consensus of opinion on the antibiotic treatment of MM infections."

We therefore determined clinical relevance, treatment and outcome of M. malmoense isolation in The Netherlands. A retrospective medical file study was conducted for all patients in The Netherlands from whom Mycobacterium malmoense had been isolated between January 2002 and January 2006. Diagnostic criteria for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) were used to determine clinical relevance. Treatment was compared with guidelines published by the British Thoracic Society. In total, 51 patients were found from whom M. malmoense was isolated. Of these, 40 (78%) patients had pulmonary isolates and 32 (80%) of them met the ATS diagnostic criteria. Cavitary disease was most common (n = 28; 88%). Patients with pulmonary disease were mostly males, with an average age of 56 yrs and pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cervical lymphadenitis was the most common extrapulmonary disease type. Adherence to treatment guidelines was poor. A good clinical response to treatment was observed in 70% and 73% of patients treated for pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, respectively. In conclusion, M. malmoense is a clinically highly relevant NTM in The Netherlands causing serious pulmonary morbidity. Adherence to treatment guidelines is not satisfactory."

Most patients are male adults presenting clinical symptoms and signs similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis. The second group is formed by immunocompetent children with localized cervical lymphadenitis. Although cervical adenitis is the main extrapulmonary manifestation of M. malmoense, virtually all cases of cervical disease were documented in children. Disseminated disease is rare and has been reported in patients with severely impaired immunity. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 47-year-old immunocompetent man with a cervical abscess, in whom we identified a M. malmoense pulmonary disease with multiple cervical, thoracic and abdominal adenopathies. CONCLUSION: Extrapulmonary infection due to M. Malmoense needs to be considered on the differential diagnosis of cervical masses and adenopathies, not only in pediatric patients but also in adults with no impaired immunity. A high index of suspicion for nontuberculous mycobacteria is essential for the diagnosis and prognosis."

We report the case of a patient who developed chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis following an infection by atypical mycobacteria. A 53-year-old woman was hospitalized because of weight loss and fever. Direct examination of sputum smear was positive for acid fast bacilli and PCR and culture led to the diagnosis of infection with M. malmoense. Treatment was begun with clarithromycin, rifampicin and ethambutol. Despite initial improvement and excellent adherence to treatment, fever and weight loss recurred 6 months later. Relapse of the mycobacterial infection was excluded and the final diagnosis was necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis. Infection with A. fumigatus complicating the treatment of M. malmoense is unusual. The management is challenging because of strong interactions between voriconazole and rifampicin, and thus requires a multidisciplinary and specialized approach."

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of NTM pulmonary infections in a London teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were culture of slow-growing mycobacteria between 2000 and 2007, age &gt; 18 y, HIV-negative, and meeting American Thoracic Society criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included; 68% were males and the median age was 61 y. Predisposing factors were smoking (70%), alcohol abuse (28%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (37%). Cavitation (56%) and infiltrates (42%) were common radiological findings. The predominant organism was Mycobacterium kansasii (70%). Ninety-three percent of patients with M. kansasii, 63% with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, 60% with Mycobacterium malmoense, and 25% with Mycobacterium xenopi had clinical disease. Of the 57 patients, 37 were treated and had follow-up data available. Most patients received 3 drugs: rifampicin, ethambutol, and clarithromycin or ciprofloxacin for at least 9 months. Thirty percent experienced drug side effects. M. kansasii treatment had a 100% cure and 10% relapse rate, but 15% died. CONCLUSIONS: M. kansasii was the most common NTM and its isolation was predictive of clinical disease. Compared with other studies, treatment with 3 agents had a similar rate of cure and did not appear to reduce the relapse rate of disease, but did increase the risk of side effects."

Much of the experience in the literature about this emerging organism comes from specialised units or populations such as cystic fibrosis patients. We, therefore, aim to evaluate the experience in a general respiratory population of dealing with patients with positive culture of NTM. We did a retrospective review of medical notes of general respiratory patients from whom NTM were isolated from January 2007 to July 2012. Cystic fibrosis patients were excluded. We reviewed 37 patients' (19 males, 18 females) medical records. A total of 73 positive cultures were reviewed. 28 isolates were from sputum samples alone, 34 isolates were from bronchoalveolar lavage alone and 11 isolates were from a combination of sputum and bronchoalveor lavage (11 isolates), We found that Mycobacterium avium was the most frequently isolated Mycobacterium in our laboratory with 22 (60%) patients had Mycobacterium avium in their pulmonary cultures. Interestingly, Mycobacterium gordonae and mycobacterium intracellulare were the second commonest mycobacterium (4, 11%) cultured. We noted 2 (5%), cases of Mycobacterium szulgai, 2 (5%) cases of Mycobacterium chelonae and 2 (5%) cases of Mycobacterium abscessus. There was 1(3%) case of Mycobacterium malmoense. There is prevalence of NTM in male COPD patients (7, 89%) and femal bronchiectasis (10, 77%) patients. Of our 8 COPD patients, 6 (75%) were on inhaled corticosteroids while 2 (25%) were not. 9 (24%) patients were smokers, 11 (30%) were ex-smokers, 14 (38%) were non-smokers and the smoking status of the remaining 3 (8%) was unknown. Of the 37 patients, only 6 (16%) received treatment. However, 2 patients stopped their treatment due to treatment toxicity. We concluded that the isolation of NTM is not uncommon. Defining NTM disease is difficult and deciding which patient to be treated needs careful evaluation as treatment can potentially be very toxic."

Their clinical relevance is still largely unknown as well as predictors for mortality in affected patients. The objective was to describe prevalence and clinical relevance of different NTM and to identify risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 124 patients with NTM detection between January 2001 and December 2011. Clinical characteristics like symptoms and radiological appearance were assessed at presentation. The primary outcome was all cause mortality during the follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard models were employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Over the study period, the frequency of NTM isolation varied from 4 to 12 patients per year. Twenty-nine out of 124 patients (23%) had a clinically relevant infection, according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Mycobacterium avium was isolated most frequently, but Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium malmoense and Mycobacterium xenopi had the highest clinical relevance. Symptoms were mostly diverse and non-specific. On radiology, cavities were observed more frequently than a nodular-bronchiectatic variant or consolidation. In 75% of all patients, follow up time was more than two years. Median survival was 6.5 years (95%CI = 2.7-10.3). Factors significantly influencing survival time were haemoptysis (HR = 0.2, 95%CI = 0.1-0.6) and a consolidation on imaging (HR = 5.1, 95%CI 1.4-18.2). CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of an infection with NTM can be diverse and depends mainly on the causative NTM pathogen. The most important predictor for increased mortality is the radiological appearance of a consolidation."

While a number of studies worldwide have described an increasing prevalence of NTM pulmonary disease over time, population-based data are relatively sparse and subject to ascertainment bias. Furthermore, the disease is geographically heterogeneous. While some species are commonly implicated worldwide (Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium abscessus), others (e.g., Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium xenopi) are regionally important. Thoracic computed tomography, microbiological testing with identification to the species level, and local epidemiology must all be taken into account to accurately diagnose NTM pulmonary disease. A diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease does not necessarily imply that treatment is required; a patient-centered approach is essential. When treatment is required, multidrug therapy based on appropriate susceptibility testing for the species in question should be used. New diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are needed to optimize the management of these complicated infections."

Difficulties in diagnosis and treatment].ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium malmoense can be difficult to diagnose. These difficulties can be responsible for a delay in the implementation of optimal treatment. Moreover, the treatment is not standardized. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who developed a Mycobacterium malmoense pulmonary infection whose diagnosis was delayed due to initial suspicion of pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient was treated empirically with rifampicin, ethambutol, and clarithromycin for 12 months after culture conversion, giving a total of 15 months. The clinical and radiological outcomes were favorable. DISCUSSION: This clinical case highlights the difficulties of diagnosing pulmonary atypical mycobacterial infection according to the American Thoracic Society criteria, particularly Mycobacterium malmoense, a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) quite uncommon in France. Currently, there are new diagnostic techniques such as GenoType Mycobacteria Direct . The second issue is the poorly standardized treatment of this NTM and many others, that are based on the recommendations of the British Thoracic Society. A national register has been set up by the MycoMed network, based essentially on the work of microbiologists but this register is unfortunately not exhaustive. CONCLUSION: A more systematic reporting strategy could allow cohort studies and therefore provide us with data on the most efficient drugs in the treatment of the rarest NTM infections."

The animal with paralysis of the legs had an abscess-like lesion in the skeletal muscle of the neck, granulomas in the mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes, and a fracture of the thirteenth thoracic vertebra with severe lesions of the spinal cord. Histologically the granulomas showed typical features of tuberculous granulomas, i.e., central necrosis surrounded by epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, inflammatory cells and a border of connective tissue. Ziehl-Neelsen stain demonstrated sporadic acid-fast bacilli within the granulomas, these organisms being identified as M. microti by microbiological and molecular methods."

However there are increasing reports of rarely occurring genetic variants such as M. canettii, M. microti and M. pinipedii. The natural reservoir, mode of transmission and potential modification of host interaction of these species is not yet fully elucidated. We report a rare case of extensive cavitary smear-positive tuberculosis of the left lung caused by M. microti in an immunocompetent tuberculin-negative 68-year-old man. Transmission by a raccoon dog or raccoon as a novel M. microti reservoir was suspected. Spoligotyping of the isolate revealed the llama subtype. The strain exhibited no detectable drug resistance. Response to standard tuberculosis treatment, initially comprising isoniacid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, was excellent. Delayed growth on solid media, specific phenotypic features and contact with animals should raise suspicion for this rare mycobacterial infection."

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical findings, diagnostic investigations, necropsy, and epidemiology results in South American camelids (SAC) infected with M. microti, member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. ANIMALS: Eleven SAC with tuberculous lesions. METHODS: Description of 10 llamas and 1 alpaca, aged 4-18 years, from 6 herds with a history of wasting and weakness admitted to the Vetsuisse-Faculty of Berne over 8 years. RESULTS: Clinical signs included weight loss, recumbency, and anorexia in late stages of the disease. Respiratory problems were seen in 6 animals of 11. No consistent hematologic abnormalities were identified. Suspect animals were examined in detail by abdominal ultrasonography and thoracic radiology. Abnormal findings such as enlarged mediastinal, mesenteric, or hepatic lymph nodes were seen only in animals with advanced disease. Single comparative intradermal tuberculin test with bovine protein purified derivate (PPD) and avian PPD was negative in all animals. At necropsy, typical tuberculous lesions were found, and confirmed by bacteriological smear and culture, molecular methods, or both. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Infection caused by M. microti should be considered a differential diagnosis in chronic debilitating disease with or without respiratory signs in SAC. Antemortem confirmation of the diagnosis remains challenging at any stage of infection. Because cases of M. microti infection have been reported in immunocompromized human patients, the zoonotic potential of the organism should be kept in mind when dealing with this disease in SAC."

To the best of our knowledge, 21 cases have been reported in the literature in the last decade. We report six recent pulmonary cases caused by M. microti over a period of 5 years detected in French clinical mycobacteriology laboratories of the hospital network. Our data confirm the potential of M. microti to cause clinical illness in immunocompetent patients. M. microti grew slowly from specimens, delaying the final microbiological diagnosis. Therefore, patients with tuberculosis caused by M. microti could benefit from the use of rapid diagnostic molecular techniques directly on clinical samples. From a review of the literature and this study, a classical antituberculous therapy seems effective in treating patients with M. microti disease."

It can be one of a large number of possible differential diagnoses in a feline patient with dermal nodules and non-healing draining ulcers, and can occasionally spread to involve the lungs and/or other areas of the body. CASE SUMMARY: This report describes the clinical signs, eventual diagnosis and variable response to treatment in a cat in Switzerland with recurrent cutaneous M microti infection. Only after several diagnostic and therapeutic attempts, over more than 2 years, was the species of Mycobacterium finally identified and targeted therapy given. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: For any cat in which there is even a low suspicion of mycobacterial infection, the authors recommend that an aggressive diagnostic approach is taken. Tissue specimens should be collected and frozen early on, and, as soon as acid-fast bacilli are detected, samples should be sent to a mycobacterial reference laboratory for definitive identification. LITERATURE REVIEW: A review of the literature relating to the aetiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of M microti infection in cats and dogs is included. This is supplemented with clinical and therapeutic experience gained from this case and other, unpublished cases managed over the past 15 years by one of the authors (DGM)."

Histopathology of 225 cases, and treatment and outcome of 184 cases.ABSTRACT:This study investigated 339 cases of feline mycobacterial infection, with histopathology findings from 225 cases, and treatment and outcome information from 184 cases. Tissue samples from cats with cutaneous lesions or suspicious masses at exploratory laparotomy were submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for mycobacterial culture over a 4-year period to December 2008. The study reviewed the files for information about histopathology, treatment and outcome, and blindly reviewed histopathological changes (including staining for acid-fast bacteria [AFB]) in a sub-set of 45 cases. When a cat is suspected of having a mycobacterial infection, accurate identification of the species involved helps to determine possible treatment options and prognosis. The study confirmed that histopathology and the presence of AFB are useful tools in the recognition of mycobacterial infection. Unfortunately, they did little to help determine the species of mycobacteria involved. The study identified a group of cats that were negative for AFB at the primary laboratory, but from which mycobacteria could be cultured; commonly Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium microti. The study also identified a group of cats which where culture negative, despite typical signs of mycobacterial infection and positive AFB staining. Many cases responded favourably to treatment (56% of the cases where information was available), and many cats gained complete remission (42%). However, relapses were common (64%) and often followed by pulmonary and/or systemic spread that may have resulted from treatment with short courses of single drugs. This study shows that the diagnosis and treatment of feline mycobacteriosis is complex and challenging."

Tissue samples were submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for mycobacterial culture over a 4-year period to December 2008. The study assessed which species of culturable mycobacteria were involved, where the cats lived, and their clinical presentation (physical findings, serum biochemistry, radiography, feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus status). Mycobacterium microti was cultured from 19%, Mycobacterium bovis 15%, Mycobacterium avium 7%, non-M avium non-tuberculous mycobacteria 6%, with no growth in 53% of samples. M microti, M bovis and M avium were found in almost mutually exclusive clusters within Great Britain (GB) (ie, M bovis in South-West England/Wales/Welsh Border, M avium in eastern England and M microti south of London and in South-West Scotland). While differences were seen in the clinical presentation and distribution of lesions caused by the different infections, these were not sufficiently different to be diagnostic. Cats commonly presented with single or multiple cutaneous lesions (74%), which were sometimes ulcerated or discharging, located most frequently on the head (54%). Lymph nodes were usually involved (47%); typically the submandibular nodes. Systemic or pulmonary signs were rarely seen (10-16%). When a cat is suspected of having mycobacteriosis, accurate identification of the species involved helps to determine appropriate action. Our findings show that knowing the cat's geographic location can be helpful, while the nature of the clinical presentation is less useful.

Previous studies have shown that infected animals develop tuberculosis. However, the disease is also known in cats and is sporadically reported from humans and other mammalian species. We examined trapped field voles from an endemic area, using a range of diagnostic approaches. These confirmed that a combination of gross and histological examination with culture is most appropriate to identify the true prevalence of the disease, which was shown to be more than 13% at times when older animals that have previously been shown to be more likely to develop the disease dominate the population. The thorough pathological examination of diseased animals showed that voles generally develop systemic disease with most frequent involvement of spleen and liver, followed by skin, lymph nodes, and lungs. The morphology of the lesions was consistent with active disease, and their distribution suggested skin wounds or oral and/or aerogenic infection as the main portal of entry. The demonstration of mycobacteria in open skin lesions, airways, and salivary glands indicated bacterial shedding from the skin and with sputum and saliva. This suggests not only the environment but also direct contact and devouring as likely sources of infection. "

METHODS: Relevant data regarding Mycobacteria culture, species identification and drug-resistance from out-patients under suspicion of having pulmonary tuberculosis seen at our TB and Pulmonary Tumor Control Institute, was analyzed retrospectively during 1994-2003. RESULTS: A total number of 12,634 strains of Mycobacteria were isolated and 794 strains were identified as MOTT which accounted for 6.28% of the isolated strains during the ten years. The annual isolation rates of MOTT were between 3.51% and 10.06%. When compared with 1994, the rates of isolation on MOTT had increased 73.15% in 2003, i.e. from 5.81% in 1994 to 10.06% in 2003. 512 strains were not susceptible at least to rifampin and isoniazid out of 613 MOTT strains tested for drug susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin sulfate and ethambutol. The average rate of multi-drugs resistance of these strains was 83.5%, and the annual rates were between 71.4% and 93.9%. Based on the results of species identification on 136 strains of MOTT in 2003, most of them belonged to pathogenic/opportunistic species of Mycobacteria. All together, 30 strains of M. abscessus, 26 of M. intracellulare, 17 of M. smegmatis, 14 of M. scrofulaceum, 11 of M. avium, 5 of M. kansasii and M. chelonae and M. fortuitum respectively, 4 of M. nonchromogenicum, 2 of M. triviale and 1 of M. aurum were identified. People at 45 years of age or older, with 55-65 the most, were more susceptible to MOTT than other age groups. Sex ratio was 3.36 to 1. CONCLUSION: Based on information from the Third National Tuberculosis Epidemiology Survey in 1990 and the Fourth one in 2000, the current situation and trend of MOTT were nearly the same in the old city area of Guangzhou during 1994-2003. However, the rising tendency of rate of isolation, mainly consisted of opportunistic pathogens and the surprisingly high rate of multi-drugs resistance to MOTT all call for special attention. Studies regarding the epidemiology of MOTT should be posed and implemented in the National TB Control Program."

This assay could evidentiate the infecting species and allow the beginning of the treatment. The test is based on the principle of immunoblotting chromatography, a rapid membrane-based assay, capable of diagnosing NTM infections in serum, in less than 1 hour, with no need of special equipment or skilled staff. The secreted extracellular antigens have been isolated from the unheated culture filtrates of the clinically significant NTM (M. avium, MAI, M. kansasii, M. xenopi, M. chelonaei, M. scrofulaceum, M. marinum, M. fortuitum, M. abscesus, M. szulgai). The patients have been tested against these antigens, as well as from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, due to the possibility of co-infection with tuberculous bacilli. A number of 385 tests on patient sera have been performed (10, with NTM suspected infection, with or without M. tuberculosis co-infection, 5 with confirmed diagnosis of NTM infection, 10 with TB, 10 with other respiratory diseases). The preliminary results presented in this paper support the fact that the rapid immunochromatographic serum assay, combined with clinical and radiographic evidence, could evidentiate the infecting NTM species and allow the start of an earlier treatment, but must be confirmed on a higher number of patients."

There were 11 cases of tuberculosis-like form and 4 cases of nodular-bronchiectasis form according to the NTM Research society classification based on the findings of chest radiography. Improvement of the findings of chest radiography was seen in 4 patients by therapy, while no change or aggravation in 11 patients. Five patients died and among them, 3 died due to aggravation of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum infection. DISCUSSION: Cases showing tuberculosis-like form were dominant, and most of them showed extensive lesions when they were diagnosed, and these facts were considered to be major factors of difficulty in the treatment of this infection. The facts that 7 cases had occupational exposure to the dust, obstructive pulmonary disease in 3 cases, and 6 cases showed sputum culture positive for other nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, suggest that local resistance of lung might be attenuated, and this could be one of factors of onset and development of this infection. Only 4 cases showed improvement, while 5 cases died (primary disease death in 3 cases) and it was thought that the prognosis of the disease was in general poor."

These include both slow-growing (eg, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium avium) and rapid-growing (eg, Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium fortuitum) species. Transmission is through ingestion or inhalation of water, particulate matter or aerosols, or through trauma. The historic presentation of pulmonary disease in older individuals with predisposing lung conditions and in children has been changing. Pulmonary disease in elderly individuals who lack the classic predisposing lung conditions is increasing. Pulmonary disease and hypersensitivity pneumonitis have been linked with occupational or home exposures to nontuberculous mycobacteria. There has been a shift from Mycobacterium scrofulaceum to M avium in children with cervical lymphadenitis. Further, individuals who are immunosuppressed due to therapy or HIV-infection are at a greatly increased risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The changing pattern of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is due in part to the ability of these pathogens to survive and proliferate in habitats that they share with humans, such as drinking water. The advent of an aging population and an increase in the proportion of immunosuppressed individuals suggest that the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease will increase."

The most common diseases produced by these microorganisms are the post-surgical infections due to anesthetic procedures, infections associated with catheters, disseminated cutaneous diseases and pulmonary and central nervous system diseases that especially affect HIV patients. Identification of the nontuberculous mycobacteria can take several weeks and even then, differentiation of complex members is not possible. OBJECTIVE: The PCR-restriction analysis (PRA) technique was evaluated as a method for genotypic identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria isolated of clinical samples located in the culture collection of the Instituto Nacional de Salud (National Institute of Health), Bogota, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy clinical isolates of nontuberculous mycobacteria stored in 50% glycerol at -70 degrees C were identified by phenotypic techniques. The genotypic identification was made using the PCR-restriction analysis (PRA) using the restriction enzymes BstEII and HseIII, the restriction products were visualized on gels of agarose to 3%, and the concordance between the methodologies was evaluated. RESULTS: A matching of 100% was obtained in the identification of Mycobacterium terrae, M. szulgai, M. avium, M. chelonae and M. scrofulaceum, the matching between M. fortuitum species, M. abscessus, M. gordonae and M. intracellulare varied from 44 to 89%; there was no concurrence in the identification of species M. flavescens and M. malmoense. CONCLUSIONS: PRA provided a fast, inexpensive and accurate alternative for the identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria that permited the differentiation among species of a complex and determining the subtype of each species sample."

Cutaneous tuberculosis is a particular tuberculosis form with differentiated clinical picture. Non-typicalness of skin changes and oligobacilleous course of extrapulmonary tuberculosis forms are repeatedly causing difficulties in adequate diagnosis and early treatment.

The study is presenting a case of lupus vulgaris as a complication of past pulmonary tuberculosis. In bacteriological diagnostics of skin changes bioptates, no tuberculosis mycobacteria were found. The disease was diagnosed based on specific granulation presence in histopathology test, tuberculin hypersensivity, bacilli DNA presence in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and skin changes regression after anti-mycobacterium treatment.

RESULTS: A total of 21,221 specimens were cultured, of which 4868 (22.94%) grew acid fast bacilli (AFB), and 248 (5.09%) of the AFB were NTM. The prevalence rate of NTM was determined as 4.26%, 4.70%, 4.96% and 6.38% among mycobacteria culture positive samples in years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. These data indicated that the prevalence rate has continuously increased. Sixteen different species of NTM were identified, the most commonly encountered NTM in Shanghai were M. chelonae (26.7%), followed by M. fortuitum (15.4%), M. kansasii (14.2%), M. avium-intracellulare complex (13.1%) and M. terrae (6.9%). The rare species identified were M. marinum, M. gastri, M. triviale, M. ulcerans, M. smegmatis, M. phlci, M. gordonae, M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. scrofulaceum and M. xenopi. The five most commonly identified NTM species showed high drug resistance to general anti-tuberculosis drugs, particularly, M. chelonae and M. fortuitum appear to be multi-drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NTM in Shanghai showed a tendency to increase over the course of the study. The five most commonly isolated NTM species showed high drug resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis drugs."

Among 10041 (21.9%) culture positive samples, 208 (2.1%) pulmonary samples recovered from 77 individual patients were differentiated as mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT). Proportion of mycobacteria evaluated as causative agent for clinical infection were found as 0.16% (n = 31), mostly M. avium complex, M. abscessus and M. kansasii. Additionally, M. fortuitum-peregrinum complex, M. simiae, M. szulgai / intermedium and M. scrofulaceum were found as causative agent in 2, 2, 2 and 1 patient, respectively. Identification of infections caused by environmental or opportunistic pathogen mycobacteria is required in rapid and accurate diagnosis, infection control and treatment planning of infections caused by M. tuberculosis complex and/or MOTT."

Diagnosis of infections caused by NTM is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological findings. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of non-tuberculous mycobacterial species isolated from clinical specimens as etiologic agents. The NTM strains isolated from clinical specimens in National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL), together with the strains that were sent to NTRL for the advanced identification of non-tuberculous mycobacterial species that have clinical or microbiological significance, were analysed retrospectively. The strains belonged to January 2009 - December 2010 period. If the same NTM type was isolated more than once in the clinical specimens of a patient, then it was defined microbiologically as a causative agent. Identification of mycobacteria species was performed by using a commercial line-probe assay (GenoType Mycobacterium CM/AS; Hain Lifescience, Germany). In our study, pulmonary and non-pulmonary samples obtained from 206 patients yielded mycobacterial growth in their cultures, and of them 24 (11.7%) were identified as NTM. On the other hand, 51 of the 101 samples sent to NTRL for identification were confirmed as NTM. Of the patients who were found to be infected with NTM (n= 75), 59 (78.7%) were male and the mean age was 50.9 +- 18.8 years. The most frequently identified NTM species was M.fortuitum (33.3%, n= 25), followed by M.abscessus (18.7%, n= 14), M.gordonae (10.7%, n= 8) and M.avium (%8; n= 6). The other types of NTM species identified in our laboratory were M.chelonae (n= 3), M.intracellulare (n= 3), M.kansasii (n= 3), M.peregrinum (n= 2), M.scrofulaceum (n= 2), M.szulgai (n= 2), M.celatum (n= 1), M.haemophilum (n= 1), M.smegmatis (n= 1) and M.xenopi (n= 1). Rapidly growing NTM species (M.fortuitum and M.abscessus) were the most frequent (52%) species isolated in our laboratory as the cause of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. Interestingly, the majority of M.fortuitum isolates (n= 21) which was the most common species identified in our laboratory, were those received from the peripheral laboratories. The most common species identified in our laboratory were rapidly growing NTM, however the countrywide distribution of the NTM species was found different than previously reported. In conclusion, further investigation of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria profile in adjunct with epidemiological data seems to be essential in our country."

The bacteriological characteristics of the strain were determined. METHODS: Species identification was performed by homologue gene sequence comparison, then a series of biochemical tests was conducted to elucidate the bacteriological characteristics. Drug susceptibility and pathogenicity to mice of the strain were tested. RESULTS: The clinical M. parascrofulaceum strain presented a very similar phenotypic profile to that of Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. The M. parascrofulaceum strain was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin in vitro. At week 2 post-infection, the lung tissues of mice demonstrated a local inflammatory response denoted by peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates. At weeks 4 and 8, the lung tissues showed peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates with large aggregates of lymphocytes and part of the tissue showed granulomatous lesions; there was no appreciable necrosis. The colony-forming units (CFU) count of infected lung and spleen increased gradually during the 8 weeks of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The M. parascrofulaceum strain isolated in China was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin. The mycobacteria were capable of proliferating in mice and could lead to pathological changes in the lungs of the mice."

Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection. RESULTS: The prevalence of NTM was 9.7% of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P &lt; 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7%), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1%), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5%), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8%) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS. CONCLUSION: NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure."

However, pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease is a rare condition with unknown clinical features. The present study aimed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease described in recent cases and reports. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all adult patients with pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease at Keio University Hospital and the National Center for Global Health and Medicine Center Hospital between 2001 and 2011. We also conducted a review of the PubMed database to identify additional cases of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease in adults. RESULTS: Our study identified 8 cases of pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease at the 2 identified institutions during our study period. Most cases were diagnosed in middle-aged and elderly men with underlying pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, as well as those with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. In contrast, most previously reported cases identified through our literature review had a history of dust inhalation or underlying silicosis. Three of 8 cases at our institutions and 20 of 23 cases from the literature were treated with combination therapies. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in the recent histories of our institutions, pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease has mainly occurred in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. We further conclude that combination therapies that include clarithromycin might yield better patient outcomes."

Their treatment also differs from that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In India, any datum on them is scarce as species identification and drug susceptibility are not performed in most laboratories. Susceptibility also differs from one geographic area to another, and in our country, there are no data even to guide the clinicians to start treatment empirically. METHODOLOGY: The present study endeavours to generate drug susceptibility data on NTM isolated from sputum samples collected and stored from 6445 symptomatics for pulmonary tuberculosis during a prevalence survey and from specimens received from the hospital. Isolates were not necessarily associated with the disease. Species were identified and antibiotic susceptibility was performed using micro-broth dilution technique as per the standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 65 NTM with 11 species were identified, of which 27 belonged to Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, 14 Mycobacterium gordonae, 9 Mycobacterium avium, 7 Mycobacterium flavescens, 4 Mycobacterium scrofulaceum and one each of others. Sensitivity to amikacin for M. fortuitum was 95.22% (20 out of 21), followed by ciprofloxacin (76.19%) and clarithromycin (71.42%). All the 9 M. avium isolates, 11 of M. gordonae (78.57%), 5 of M. flavescens and 2 of M. scrofulaceum were sensitive to clarithromycin. All NTM were resistant to first-line antitubercular drugs except 8, which were sensitive to streptomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Drug sensitivity of NTM varies from species to species. While amikacin was the best for rapidly growing mycobacteria, clarithromycin was the most active drug against M. avium and other slow growers."

Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) often cause extrapulmonary and pulmonary disease. Mycobacteria detection at species level is necessary and provides useful information on epidemiology and facilitates successful treatment of patients. This retrospective study aimed to determine the incidence of the NTM isolates and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in clinical specimens collected from Iranian patients during February 2011-December 2013, by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PRA) of the hsp65 gene. We applied conventional biochemical test and hsp65-PRA identification assay to identify species of mycobacteria in specimens from patients suspected of having mycobacterial isolates. This method was a sensitive, specific and effective assay for detecting mycobacterial species and had a 100% sensitivity and specificity for Mtb and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species. Using PRA for 380 mycobacterial selected isolates, including 317 Mtb, four Mycobacterium bovis and of the 59 clinical isolates, the most commonly identified organism was Mycobacterium kansasii (35.6%), followed by Mycobacterium simiae (16.9%), Mycobacterium gordonae (16.9%), Mycobacterium fortuitum (5.1%), Mycobacterium intracellulare (5.1%), Mycobacterium avium (5.1%), Mycobacterium scrofulaceum (3.4%), Mycobacterium gastri (3.4%), Mycobacterium flavescens (3.4%), Mycobacterium chelonae (3.4%) and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum (1.7%). PRA method, in comparison with classical methods, is rapid, useful and sensitive for the phylogenetic analysis and species detection of mycobacterial strains. Mycobacterium kansasii is the most common cause of infection by NTM in patients with non-HIV and HIV which demonstrated a high outbreak and diversity of NTM strains in our laboratory."

The data on prevalence of NTM under the RNTCP is scarce. Many NTM species have clinical significance, and hence their identification and speciation are important. METHODS AND RESULTS: It is a cross-sectional study conducted at the five RNTCP accredited culture and drug susceptibility testing (CDST) laboratory. The culture isolates from AFB positive but Immunochromatographic test negative samples were taken for identification and speciation using HPLC. Of the total 266 isolates only 164 isolates had a second sample received at the laboratory. The speciation was done using HPLC for those isolates. The type of species identified are: 26 8% (44) were Mycobacterium chelonae, 12 8% (21) were Mycobacterium fortuitum, 9% (15) were Mycobacterium gordonae, 9% (15) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, 6 1% (10) were Mycobacterium kansasii, 4 9% (8) were Mycobacterium simiae, 2 4% (4) were Mycobacterium thermophile, 1 2% (2) were Mycobacterium gastri, 0 6% (1) were Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, 0 6% (1) were Mycobacterium avium and 4 9% (8) isolates had chromatogram which was un-interpretable. CONCLUSION: Identification and its speciation of NTM are not routinely done under TB control programme. Since HPLC could identify 95% of isolates belonging to 10 species, the speciation of NTM using HPLC should gain importance in the diagnosis of disease caused by NTM. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: NTM are emerging as important causative agents of pulmonary and extra pulmonary disease, the ability to recognize disease caused by NTM and subsequently treat such disease has become increasingly important. The identification of NTM up to its species level should gain importance in all TB reference Laboratories."

Specific identification is important as treatment varies according to Mycobacterium species causing the infection. This study used multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for rapid differentiation of mycobacterial growth indicator tube 960 system (MGIT) cultures as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) or NTM together with INNO LiPA Mycobacteria v2 assay (LiPA) and/or PCR sequencing of rDNA for species-specific identification of selected MTB and all NTM isolates in Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from MGIT cultures (n = 1,033) grown from 664 pulmonary and 369 extrapulmonary specimens from 1,033 suspected tuberculosis patients. mPCR was performed to differentiate MTB from NTM. LiPA was performed and results were interpreted according to kit instructions. rDNA was amplified and sequenced by using panmycobacterial primers. RESULTS: mPCR identified 979 isolates as MTB, 53 as NTM and 1 isolate as mixed culture. LiPA and/or PCR sequencing confirmed 112 of 979 selected isolates as MTB. Mixed culture contained M. tuberculosis and M. fortuitum. LiPA yielded 12 patterns and identified 10 species/species complexes among 47 NTM, M. kansasii + M. scrofulaceum in one culture and 5 isolates only at genus level. PCR sequencing yielded more specific identification for 22 isolates at the species/subspecies level. CONCLUSIONS: mPCR rapidly differentiated MTB from NTM. LiPA identified 44 of 52 NTM isolates at the species/species complex level and 2 mixed cultures. PCR sequencing yielded more specific identification at the species/subspecies level. Rapid differentiation as MTB or NTM by mPCR, followed by species-specific NTM identification by LiPA/PCR sequencing is suitable for the proper management of mycobacterial infections in Kuwait."

To further characterize manifestations of M. scrofulaceum disease and treatment approaches, we reviewed our medical centre's experience and other published reports. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients at our medical centre with a positive M. scrofulaceum culture over a 15-year period. We compare our findings with those published in the literature to identify commonalities in disease presentations and treatment outcomes. Results: We identified 17 patients in our centre with positive M. scrofulaceum cultures, 10 of whom were diagnosed with clinical infection. The types of disease encountered included pulmonary and pleural infection (4), bone and joint infections with a foreign body (2), skin and soft tissue infection (2), brain abscess (1) and paediatric cervical adenitis (1). Structural lung disease was a common finding in cases of pulmonary infection. All adult patients except those with bone and joint infections had some type of immunomodulatory condition and/or structural lung disease. In seven patients, M. scrofulaceum was isolated in urinary or respiratory cultures without signs of clinical disease. Conclusion: M. scrofulaceum is a rare cause of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infection in humans but can infect any tissue. Adults with pulmonary disease often have underlying structural lung disease, and those with extrapulmonary disease commonly have immunosuppressive conditions or foreign body-associated infections. Treatment outcomes are generally favourable; however, in patients with pulmonary M. scrofulaceum disease prognosis is more guarded."

We report two cases of lung disease due to M. shimoidei and the associated bacteriological results. A 45-year-old man (Case 1) admitted to National Hospital Organization (NHO) Miyagi Hospital, a 75-year-old man (Case 2) admitted to NHO Higashi-Hiroshima Medical Center were found in initial chest X-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT) to have a tuberculosis-like cavity in the left apex (Case 1) and the right apex (Case 2). In Case 1, the patient was treated with isoniazid and rifampicin for one month and lesions showed a partial response. In Case 2, the patient responded favorably with rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin, and clarithromycin therapy. Mycobacteria were repeatedly detected in smear and culture from sputum specimens in both patients. Isolates were nonphotochromogenic and rough. Isolated colonies developed after two to three weeks on 2% Ogawa egg medium. Organisms grew on 2% Ogawa egg medium at 30, 37, 42, and 45 degrees C, but not 25 degrees C. Both organisms were susceptible to 500 microg of p-nitrobenzoate per mL and 5mg of sodium chloride per mL. Isolates were negative for niacin accumulation, nitrate reduction, semiquantitative catalase, 68 degrees C catalase, 3-day aryl-sulfatase, iron uptake, and MPB64 antigen production, but positive for Tween 80 hydrolysis (5 and 10 days), acid phosphatase, and pyrazinamidase. Isolates had typical uv-HPLC chromatograms similar to M. shimoidei, demonstrating triple-peak clusters with peaks in the early cluster. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed isolates to be consistent with Mycobacterium shimoidei.

However, several cases with membranous glomerulonephritis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been reported. Mycobacterium shimoidei is an uncommon pathogen, and less than 20 cases with this species have been reported. A therapeutic regimen for this infection has not been established yet. CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old Japanese man presented with productive cough for 6 months. Computed tomography scan showed multiple cavities in the bilateral pulmonary fields. Acid-fast bacilli were evident in his sputum by Ziehl-Neelsen staining (Gaffky 3). PCR amplifications for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobacterium intracellulare were all negative. Finally, Mycobacterium shimoidei was identified by rpoB sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing. Urine examination showed a sub-nephrotic range of proteinuria and histology of the kidney showed membranous glomerulonephritis. Antimycobacterial treatment with clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol dramatically improved not only the pulmonary disease, but also the proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the presented case is the first report showing non-tuberculous mycobacterium-induced secondary membranous glomerulonephritis. A combination with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampicin might be effective for treatment of Mycobacterium shimoidei infection."

In cats, mycobacteriosis caused by NTM is considered mostly to be a focal or dermal infection, with disseminated disease mostly caused by Mycobacterium avium. We describe three cases of disseminated mycobacteriosis in cats, caused by Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium branderi/shimoidei and M. avium, with no identified underlying immunosuppression. In all cases, extracellular mycobacteria were seen in the pulmonary epithelium, intestinal lumen and glomerular tufts, which could affect the shedding of the organism. The present study highlights the importance of mycobacteriosis as a differential even in immunocompetent animals. Considering the close relationship of owners and pets and the potential presence of free mycobacteria in secretions, cats should be considered as a possible environmental reservoir for mycobacteria."

A slight (54%) female predominance was observed, which is uncommon for nontuberculous mycobacteria isolation. Fulfilment of the diagnostic criteria and initiation of treatment were not in agreement; treatment results were poor. Only a minority of clinical M. simiae isolates are clinically relevant and, applying the American Thoracic Society diagnostic criteria, the number of true infections is overestimated. Physicians in the Netherlands do not always use these criteria in daily practice, resulting in both over- and underdiagnosis of M. simiae infection.

Data on patient background and clinical features were collected, and chest radiographs were analysed. Sixty percent of the M. kansasii group were native born compared to 18% of the M. simiae group (p=0.0001). M. simiae infection was associated with a higher rate of co-morbid disease, including diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and malignancy. A similar rate of lung disease was found in both groups.

However, NTM are a heterogeneous group and most of the data come from only three species: Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus. Still, information about these three species is confusing because it is based mainly on retrospective studies and series of clinical cases performed in developed countries. In recent years, new information has appeared about other species and the pathogenesis of NTM. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that NTM infection is a worldwide phenomenon with an increasing presence in developing countries perhaps because of the implementation of tap water. Women with characteristic phenotype are at higher risk of acquiring NTM infection along with patients with defects on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. New studies on Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium szulgai and Mycobacterium simiae indicate that the American Thoracic Society criteria for diagnosing NTM disease may not be useful for all species of NTM. SUMMARY: New multicentric and prospective studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of NTM. These organisms form a numerous and heterogeneous group and each species should be studied separately."

This study aimed to determine the clinical and radiological manifestation, as well as the treatment, of M. simiae in patients in Masih Daneshvari Hospital, a TB referral hospital in Iran. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study involved all patients presenting to our referral center from 2002 to 2009, with confirmation of M. simiae pulmonary infection. For all patients, sputum smear and culture for identification was performed, as was drug susceptibility testing. Additionally, PCR identification methods for NTM, and high-resolution CT scan were conducted. All patients were treated according to American Thoracic Society recommendations. RESULTS: In total, 26 cases of M. simiae were identified in our center. The mean age of the patients was 58.23 +- 16.9years. Only one patient was HIV positive, and all but one were Iranian. The most frequent symptom was coughing (92.3%), and 100% of the patients had nodular lesions. In addition, bronchiectasis and cavitation were present in 84.6% and 88.5% respectively. All the patients were resistant to every first-line drug. Two patients failed the treatment, and twenty-four were cured, after which no recurrence of the disease was observed. CONCLUSION: M. simiae may present with clinical and radiological manifestations consistent with tuberculosis, and be resistant to anti-TB agents. A more efficient treatment for NTMs such as M. simiae is needed, to shorten the period of treatment and proved fewer adverse effects than current therapies."

The outcome of treatment for NTM lung disease is poor, particularly lung disease caused by Mycobacterium simiae and M. abscessus. Exploring synergy between active available drugs is a sensible way forward given the lack of new active drugs. We tested for synergy between amikacin and clofazimine, using standardized methods, in 564 consecutive clinical isolates identified as 21 species of rapidly growing mycobacteria, 16 clinical M. avium complex isolates, and 10 M. simiae isolates. Clofazimine and amikacin are each active in vitro against NTM; 97% (n = 548) of the rapid growers revealed MICs of clofazimine of &lt;=1 mug/ml, and 93% (n = 524) proved susceptible to amikacin. The combination showed significant synergistic activity in 56 of 68 (82%) eligible M. abscessus isolates, 4 of 5 M. chelonae isolates, and 1 M. fortuitum and 1 M. cosmeticum isolate, with 4- to 8-fold decreases in MICs to both drugs. Significant synergy could also be demonstrated against all M. avium complex and M. simiae isolates, with fractional inhibitory concentrations of &lt;0.5. Clofazimine and amikacin show significant synergistic activity against both rapidly and slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria. The safety and tolerability of adding clofazimine to amikacin-containing regimens should be tested in clinical trials, and the results of susceptibility tests for these two compounds and their combination merit clinical validation.

We aimed to evaluate the contribution of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) to pulmonary disease in patients from the state of Rondonia using respiratory samples and epidemiological data from TB cases. Mycobacterium isolates were identified using a combination of conventional tests, polymerase chain reaction-based restriction enzyme analysis of hsp65 gene and hsp65 gene sequencing. Among the 1,812 cases suspected of having pulmonary TB, 444 yielded bacterial cultures, including 369 cases positive for MTB and 75 cases positive for NTM. Within the latter group, 14 species were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium gilvum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium asiaticum, Mycobacterium tusciae, Mycobacterium porcinum, Mycobacterium novocastrense, Mycobacterium simiae, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium holsaticum and 13 isolates could not be identified at the species level. The majority of NTM cases were observed in Porto Velho and the relative frequency of NTM compared with MTB was highest in Ji-Parana. In approximately half of the TB subjects with NTM, a second sample containing NTM was obtained, confirming this as the disease-causing agent. The most frequently observed NTM species were M. abscessus and M. avium and because the former species is resistant to many antibiotics and displays unsatisfactory cure rates, the implementation of rapid identification of mycobacterium species is of considerable importance.

Five respiratory tract isolates were further reported in Iran. Here, we report the first isolation of M. europaeum in France, in the respiratory tract of a patient co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Caucasian woman with a 26-year history of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus co-infection was admitted for significant influenza-like syndrome in a context of repetitive exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significant biological parameters included lymphocytes of 1.6G/L including 237/mm3 T4 lymphocytes, a human immunodeficiency virus viral load of 1.6 log and a hepatitis C virus viral load of 6 log. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of her nasopharyngeal aspiration confirmed influenza A H1N1. Three sputum specimens lacked acid-fast bacilli but one grew mycobacteria identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry as M. europaeum with a 1.56 log score. A 1,482-bp 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequence yielded 99% similarity with both Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum ATCC BAA-614 and M. europaeum DSM 45397T and partial rpoB polymerase chain reaction-sequencing yielded a 725-bp sequence exhibiting 100% similarity with M. europaeum strain DSM 45397T.

Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

However, the treatment protocol is not similar. Mycobacterium simiae is a rare cause of NTM pulmonary infection. Herein, we aimed to evaluate and compare the computed tomography (CT) scan findings of M. simiae infection in lungs. For this reason, thirty-four patients (n = 34) with M. simiae lung infection were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnosis was confirmed by American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines and CT scans were reviewed in both lung and mediastinal windows. The average age of patients was 63 +- 14.54 years and 52.9% were male. The majority of patients had cough (91.2%) and sputum production (76.5%). Clinically, 41.2% of patients had previous history of TB (14/34), 38.2% had cardiac diseases (13/34), and 35.3% had diabetes mellitus (12/34). The most common CT findings in our study were nodular lesions (100%) and bronchiectasis (85.29%). Regarding the severity, grade I bronchiectasis was the most prevalent. Other prominent findings were tree-in-bud sign (88.2%), consolidation (52.94%), and lobar fibrosis and volume loss (67.6%). There was no significant zonal distribution of findings. In conclusion, nodular lesions and bronchiectasis are the most frequent features in CT scan of M. simiae pulmonary infection."

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of NTM in clinical samples and genetic diversity using 16S rRNA and rpoB sequence analysis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 45 diverse isolates collected from sputum in 2 years 2014-2015 using standard decontamination procedure. All mycobacterial isolates were grown on LJ medium and also conventional tests for preliminary identification of mycobacteria rely on traits and then DNA extraction. PCR was performed, and sequencing of 16S rRNA and rpoB genes was applied for NTM strains identification. RESULTS: A total of 45 isolates collected, 37 samples (83%) were evaluated as NTM. All NTM strains using molecular methods by sequencing 16S rRNA and rpoB gene were identified, by this way 12 different species have been identified which sequencing of rpoB was able to identify all species. The major species obtained were Mycobacterium simiae (22%), M. fortuitum (19%), and M. abscessus (13%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed that the patients were infected by a wide range of atypical mycobacteria. It was concluded that 16S rRNA gene sequencing coupled with rpoB marker is a high discriminatory power in identification of NTM. The presence of various species in clinical samples in Iran emphasizes the use of molecular method like sequence analysis of genes is necessary for reliable identification."

This study aimed to identify NTMs isolated from pulmonary TB cases and also determine their susceptibility to streptomycin (STR), isoniazid (INH), and rifampicin (RIF). METHODS: A total of 1755 mycobacterial isolates, obtained between August 2012 and July 2014, from 2036 smear-positive pulmonary cases were identified using polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS6110, and hsp65 gene sequencing analysis. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was then performed for the identified NTMs against STR, INH, and RIF using microplate Alamar blue assay. The results were analyzed against patients' biodata for statistical associations. RESULTS: Of the 1755 analyzed isolates, we identified 43 (2.5%) NTMs, which included 18 (41.9%) Mycobacterium intracellulare, 13 (30.2%) Mycobacterium avium subs. paratuberculosis, 5 (11.3%) Mycobacterium abscessus, 3 (7.0%) each of Mycobacterium mucogenicum and Mycobacterium colombiense, and 1 (2.3%) Mycobacterium simiae. Patients infected with NTMs (52.0%) were more likely to be human immunodeficiency virus-positive (P = 0.001, odds ratio = 6.6, 95% confidence interval = 2.7-16.2) than those infected with M. tuberculosis complex (5.8%). All the 43 (100%) NTMs were resistant to INH, whereas 32 (74%) and 19 (44%) were resistant to RIF and STR, respectively. Furthermore, 16 (37.2%) NTMs were resistant to all three drugs, 20 were resistant to INH and RIF, and 3 were resistant to STR and INH. All the M. abscessus isolates were resistant to all the three drugs, whereas all the M. avium isolates were resistant to INH and RIF, but only three were resistant to STR. Among the M. intracellulare isolates, 8, 18, and 15 isolates were resistant to STR, INH, and RIF, respectively. CONCLUSION: The observed high-resistance level to INH and RIF supports the need for rapid species identification and DST of nonresponding TB cases before retreatment."

Analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequence supported placement into the genus Mycobacterium with high sequence similarity to a previously undescribed strain isolated from a patient respiratory sample from Oregon, USA, held in a collection in Colorado, USA, in 2000. The two isolates were subjected to phenotypic testing and whole genome sequencing and found to be indistinguishable. The bacteria were acid-fast stain-positive, rod-shaped and exhibited growth after 7-10 days on solid media at temperatures ranging from 25 to 42 C. Colonies were non-pigmented, rough and slightly raised. Analyses of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight profiles showed no matches against a reference library of 130 mycobacterial species. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were identical for the two isolates, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) between their genomes was 99.7 % and phylogenetic comparisons classified the novel mycobacteria as the basal most species in the slowly growing Mycobacterium clade. Mycobacterium avium is the most closely related species based on rpoB gene sequence similarity (92 %), but the ANI between the genomes was 81.5 %, below the suggested cut-off for differentiating two species (95 %). Mycolic acid profiles were more similar to M. avium than to Mycobacterium simiae or Mycobacterium abscessus. The phenotypic and genomic data support the conclusion that the two related isolates represent a novel Mycobacterium species for which the name Mycobacterium talmoniae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NE-TNMC-100812T (=ATCC BAA-2683T=DSM 46873T)."

Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) often cause extrapulmonary and pulmonary disease. Mycobacteria detection at species level is necessary and provides useful information on epidemiology and facilitates successful treatment of patients. This retrospective study aimed to determine the incidence of the NTM isolates and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in clinical specimens collected from Iranian patients during February 2011-December 2013, by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PRA) of the hsp65 gene. We applied conventional biochemical test and hsp65-PRA identification assay to identify species of mycobacteria in specimens from patients suspected of having mycobacterial isolates. This method was a sensitive, specific and effective assay for detecting mycobacterial species and had a 100% sensitivity and specificity for Mtb and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species. Using PRA for 380 mycobacterial selected isolates, including 317 Mtb, four Mycobacterium bovis and of the 59 clinical isolates, the most commonly identified organism was Mycobacterium kansasii (35.6%), followed by Mycobacterium simiae (16.9%), Mycobacterium gordonae (16.9%), Mycobacterium fortuitum (5.1%), Mycobacterium intracellulare (5.1%), Mycobacterium avium (5.1%), Mycobacterium scrofulaceum (3.4%), Mycobacterium gastri (3.4%), Mycobacterium flavescens (3.4%), Mycobacterium chelonae (3.4%) and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum (1.7%). PRA method, in comparison with classical methods, is rapid, useful and sensitive for the phylogenetic analysis and species detection of mycobacterial strains. Mycobacterium kansasii is the most common cause of infection by NTM in patients with non-HIV and HIV which demonstrated a high outbreak and diversity of NTM strains in our laboratory."

The data on prevalence of NTM under the RNTCP is scarce. Many NTM species have clinical significance, and hence their identification and speciation are important. METHODS AND RESULTS: It is a cross-sectional study conducted at the five RNTCP accredited culture and drug susceptibility testing (CDST) laboratory. The culture isolates from AFB positive but Immunochromatographic test negative samples were taken for identification and speciation using HPLC. Of the total 266 isolates only 164 isolates had a second sample received at the laboratory. The speciation was done using HPLC for those isolates. The type of species identified are: 26 8% (44) were Mycobacterium chelonae, 12 8% (21) were Mycobacterium fortuitum, 9% (15) were Mycobacterium gordonae, 9% (15) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, 6 1% (10) were Mycobacterium kansasii, 4 9% (8) were Mycobacterium simiae, 2 4% (4) were Mycobacterium thermophile, 1 2% (2) were Mycobacterium gastri, 0 6% (1) were Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, 0 6% (1) were Mycobacterium avium and 4 9% (8) isolates had chromatogram which was un-interpretable. CONCLUSION: Identification and its speciation of NTM are not routinely done under TB control programme. Since HPLC could identify 95% of isolates belonging to 10 species, the speciation of NTM using HPLC should gain importance in the diagnosis of disease caused by NTM. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: NTM are emerging as important causative agents of pulmonary and extra pulmonary disease, the ability to recognize disease caused by NTM and subsequently treat such disease has become increasingly important. The identification of NTM up to its species level should gain importance in all TB reference Laboratories."

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with positive cultures for M. simiae isolated between 2004 and 2016 at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. RESULTS: This study included 103 M. simiae isolates recovered from 51 patients. Their mean age was 62.7 years. The majority were males and smokers. Specimens were mostly from respiratory sources (97%). Common comorbidities included chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), solid tumor, systemic disease, and diabetes mellitus. Productive cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Frequent radiographic findings were infiltrates and nodules on chest X-ray and nodules, infiltrates, and bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography scan. Among 18 tested isolates, 5.8% were resistant to clarithromycin, 11.7% to amikacin, and 70-100% to other antimicrobials. Out of 13 patients receiving early treatment, 5 noted improvement, one had recurrence of symptoms, two received alternative diagnosis, and five died. Two of those deaths were related to M. simiae. Common treatment regimens included clarithromycin in different combinations with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and amikacin. Moreover, clofazimine was used in only two patients whose isolates were resistant to all but one agent. Duration of treatment ranged from 6-24 months. CONCLUSION: In Lebanon, M. simiae is increasingly encountered with true infection rates of at least 47%. Furthermore, the prevalence of multidrug resistance among the Lebanese M. simiae isolates is very high limiting the treatment options."

Some of the species are resistant to various antibiotics; hence, limited treatment options are available. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of NTM and to determine the effect of d-cycloserine against Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium abscessus isolated from clinical specimens to find out the synergistic effect of d-cycloserine and clarithromycin. Methods: A total of 95 nonduplicate pulmonary isolates of NTM were collected from three major Regional Tuberculosis (TB) Centers. NTM isolates were identified by conventional tests and PCR sequence analysis of the rpoB gene. PCR sequencing of erm-41 was performed for detecting the inducible resistance to macrolides. In vitro susceptibilities and activities of d-cycloserine-clarithromycin combinations were accessed using the broth microdilution method. Results: Among 714-positive acid-fast bacilli from TB-suspected cases, 95 isolates were identified as NTM (13.3%). The prevalence of identified isolates was as follows: M. fortuitum 46 (48.4%), Mycobacterium simiae 16 (16.8%), Mycobacterium kansasii 15 (15.7%), M. abscessus 7 (7.3%), Mycobacterium thermoresistibile 4 (4.2%), Mycobacterium elephantis 3 (3.2%), Mycobacterium porcinum 2 (2.1%), and Mycobacterium chimaera 2 (2.1%). In addition, rpoB sequence analysis could identify all NTM isolates. The effect of d-cycloserine was better than that of clarithromycin. The synergistic effect of d-cycloserine with clarithromycin was observed for six (100%) and five (71.5%) strains of M. fortuitum and M. abscessus, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, we demonstrated a wide range of NTM in processed samples from different provinces of Iran. Our observations indicated that d-cycloserine was very active against M. abscessus and M. fortuitum; hence, d-cycloserine, either alone or in combination with clarithromycin, may be promising for the treatment of M. abscessus- and M. fortuitum-associated diseases."

A large paucity of data related to pediatric NTM diseases exists globally and particularly in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The first nationwide exploratory study on existence of NTM diseases among Saudi Arabian children (0-14 years old) has been carried out during 2016-2017. Suspected NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data were enrolled from regional reference laboratories. Species level identification of isolates was carried out by commercial line probe assays and gene sequencing. RESULTS: In 12 months, 52 culture positive cases with 44(84.6%) confirmed disease incidences were identified. Demographically, Saudi nationals (86.5%) were dominated and 77.3% cases have different comorbid conditions. Lymphadenitis (40.4%) followed by 26.9% of pulmonary cases with 42.8% of confirmed clinical relevance were mainly reported.

They may be misdiagnosed and treated as PTB, often categorized as treatment failures if they do not respond to treatment. This manuscript aims to characterize patients with pulmonary NTM disease. METHODS: Patient characteristics of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary NTM disease, attending the ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai were prospectively compiled over a two-year period (2017-2018). RESULTS: A total of 122 patients with recurrent chest symptoms and not responding to anti-tuberculosis treatment were screened for NTM. Thirty-nine cases (26 males and 13 females) of symptomatic pulmonary NTM were diagnosed. The mean (SD) patient age and body mass index were 48.6 +- 11 years and 16.3 +- 3. All male participants were smokers, had at least one episode of previous ATT. Mycobacterium kansasii (48.7%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by Mycobacterium intracellulare (20.5%), Mycobacterium abscessus (7.6%) followed by Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kyorinense, and Mycobacterium simiae. Infection with multiple NTMs was seen in four patients. Isoniazid resistance was identified in 20 patients. Based on species identified, treatment was initiated as per American Thoracic Society guidelines and continued up to 12 months of culture negativity. CONCLUSIONS: M. kansasii is the commonest pulmonary NTM isolated in Tamilnadu with a higher prevalence in males and elderly. Sensitization of both patients and providers is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis of pulmonary NTM disease as pulmonary TB."

This group of bacteria consists of at least 200 different species. While the pulmonary disease is the most common form of NTM infections, NTM can cause diffused infections as well as extrapulmonary infections in every organ, such as bone marrow, skin, eye, and brain. The NTM cause tuberculosis-like infections, therefore, correct identification of these Mycobacteria is necessary to avoid faulty treatment. Different species of NTM isolates were identified from clinical specimens using phenotypic methods and Line Probe Assay. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration for selected antibiotics was obtained by the broth micro-dilution method. Totally, 42 NTM isolates were identified in this study. Moreover, the frequency of NTM between all positive mycobacterium cultures was estimated at 12%. The most common Rapidly Growing Mycobacteria included Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (30.9%), Mycobacterium abscessus (7.1%), and Mycobacterium chelonae (2.3%), whereas Mycobacterium simiae (40.4%), Mycobacterium kansasii (16.6%), and Mycobacterium avium complex (2.3%) were the most recurring among the Slowly Growing Mycobacteria. Amikacin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against isolated NTM. The NTM isolates are frequently being separated from Iranian patients, and are mostly resistant to the wide spectrum of antibiotics. Correct identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility can be helpful in the healing process of the patients who suffer from non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections."

Studies on these pathogens from the Middle-East including Lebanon are scarce. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study addresses the approach used for investigation, speciation and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of recovered NTM isolates from respiratory sources at a major tertiary care center in Lebanon during two periods (2003-2007 and 2013-2017). Processing of specimens, culture and differentiation of recovered NTM isolates from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were done in-house according to standard procedures. Upon request, speciation and AMR testing were performed using molecular and broth dilution methods, respectively, at Mayo Medical Laboratories (Rochester, Minnesota, USA). RESULTS: Among 108 NTM analyzed isolates, 8 species were revealed during the two periods: M. simiae (51% vs 61%), M. avium complex (MAC) (6 % vs 12%) M. fortuitum (12% vs 5%), M. gordonae (6% vs 5%), M. abscessus (6% vs 7%), M. immunogenum (12% vs 0%), M. szulgai (4% vs 0%) and M. peregrinum (0% vs 2%). M. simiae isolates showed high susceptibility (93%-96%) to amikacin and clarithromycin, but high resistance to rifampin, ethambutol, ciprofloxacin, rifabutin, linezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and moxifloxacin. MAC isolates were only susceptible to clarithromycin (86%). M. abscessus isolates were uniformly susceptible to amikacin (100%).

Slit skin smear for leprosy was negative and tuberculosis, fungal and bacterial cultures of the lymph node and bone marrow did not reveal any growth. Later he developed watery diarrhea and colonoscopy revealed multiple small polyps and ulcers throughout the colon extending up to the ileum, Which was confirmed to be due to cytomegalovirus confirmed by PCR and successfully treated with ganciclovir. Positron emission tomography scan guided biopsies of the gut and lymph nodes confirmed presence of mycobacterial spindle cell pseudo-tumours and PCR assays revealed positive HSP65. The culture grew Mycobacterium Simiae. Flow cytometry analysis on patient's blood showed extremely low T and B cell counts and immunofixation revealed low immunoglobulin levels. His condition was later diagnosed as adult onset immunodeficiency due to anti- interferon - gamma autoantibodies. He was initially commenced on empirical anti-TB treatment with atypical mycobacterial coverage. He is currently on a combination of daily clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid with monthly 2 g/kg/intravenous immunoglobulin to which, he had a remarkable clinical response with complete resolution of lymphadenopathy and healing of sinuses. CONCLUSIONS: This infection is considered to be restricted to certain geographic areas such as mainly Iran, Cuba, Israel and Arizona and this is the first case report from Sri lanka. Even though the infection is mostly seen in the elderly patients, our patient was only 24 years old. In the literature pulmonary involvement was common presentation, but in this case the patient had generalized lymphadenopathy and colonic involvement without pulmonary involvement."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five clinical isolates of M. simiaefrom 80 patients with confirmed NTM pulmonary disease were included in this study. For drug susceptibility testing (DST), proportional and broth microdilution methods were used according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guideline. RESULTS: All clinical isolates of M. simiaewere resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin. They also were highly resistant to ofloxacin (80%). Susceptibility to ofloxacin was only noted in the 5 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical isolates of M. simiae were multidrug-resistant, and had different drug susceptibility patterns than previously published studies. DST results can assist in selecting more appropriate treatment regimens. Newer drugs with proven clinical efficacy correlating with in vitrosusceptibility should be substituted with first-and second-line anti-TB drug testing."

During the study period, 50 patients with hematological malignancy and tuberculosis (TB) were also evaluated. Among 2,846 patients with hematological malignancy, 34 (1.2%) patients had NTM infections. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (13 patients, 38%) was the most commonly isolated species, followed by M. abscessus (21%), M. fortuitum (18%), and M. kansasii (18%). Twenty-six patients had pulmonary NTM infection and eight patients had disseminated disease. Neutropenia was more frequently encountered among patients with disseminated NTM disease (p = 0.007) at diagnosis than among patients with pulmonary disease only. Twenty-five (74%) patients received adequate initial antibiotic treatment. Five of the 34 patients died within 30 days after diagnosis. Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that chronic kidney disease (p = 0.017) and neutropenia at diagnosis (p = 0.032) were independent prognostic factors of NTM infection in patients with hematological malignancy. Patients with NTM infection had higher absolute neutrophil counts at diagnosis (p = 0.003) and a higher 30-day mortality rate (15% vs. 2%, p = 0.025) than TB patients. Hematological patients with chronic kidney disease and febrile neutropenia who developed NTM infection had significant worse prognosis than patients with TB infection."

Human infections are mostly disseminated in the setting of the AIDS epidemic or the use of aggressive immunosuppressive treatments. M. genavense culture is fastidious, requiring supplemented media. Pulmonary involvement rarely occurs as a primary localization. CASES PRESENTATION: We report here two patients with pneumonia as the predominant manifestation of M. genavense infection: one kidney transplanted patient and one HIV-infected patient. Both patients were initially treated with anti-tuberculous drugs before the identification of M. genavense on sputum or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid culture. A four-drug regimen including clarithromycin and rifabutin was started. Gamma interferon has been helpful in addition to antimycobacterial treatment for one patient. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware that M. genavense could be the etiologic agent of sub-acute pneumonia mimicking tuberculosis in patients with cellular immunodeficiency status."

Patients, either immunocompetent or immunocompromised, with orwithout underlying disease, are contaminated from the environment. Diagnosis, according to standardized criteria, is based on clinical picture, radiological exams and positive microbiological samples, usually on more than one occasion (slow growing culture and PCR).

Exacerbation of infectious pneumonitis and interstitial pneumonia required complementary inpatient treatment in August 2007. Although polymerase chain reaction examination of expectorated sputa revealed the absence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. intracellulare on admission, nontuberculous M. abscessus was detected in the routine blood cultures. Taken together with clinical findings, M. abscessus was most likely the primary causative organism. Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be highly helpful for diagnosis."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium szulgaiID:22305672TITLE:[Atypical mycobacteria and pulmonary involvement in infectious diseases].ABSTRACT:Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly associated with infectious pulmonary disease. NTM are ubiquitous environmental pathogens with high isolation rates worldwide. The greater frequency of NTM associated with pulmonary diseases is probably due to a combination of increased exposure, improved diagnostic methods and an increase in the prevalence of risk factors predisposing individuals to infection. Difficulty may arise in determining whether an isolate from a respiratory sample is in fact a contaminant or a pathogenic organism. The ATS/IDSA guidelines highlight the importance of following microbiological and clinical criteria in making a diagnosis of NTM lung infection. These criteria may not be useful for all NTM and species-level identification is strongly recommended. Mycobacteria identification by conventional methods has been the standard in most clinical microbiology laboratories. However, conventional testing alone does not allow identification of many NTM. Newer, rapid molecular methods such as commercially available nucleic acid probes, genomic amplification and DNA sequence analysis should be used. Communication between the clinician and the laboratorian is essential to decide whether an isolate could be sent to a reference laboratory to determine the best method for species identification. Although the CLSI has recently published an approved standard for NTM susceptibility testing, there is ongoing debate about the role of in vitro susceptibility for managing patients with NTM disease. The goal of this review is to describe the mycobacteria involved in lung disease, the factors that predispose to this infection, its diagnosis with alternative procedures and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response."

We investigated the trends of NTM lung disease at a tertiary hospital in Korea and evaluated the contribution of liquid culture systems. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of mycobacterial cultures of respiratory specimens from 26,793 patients at Severance Hospital in South Korea from January 2006 to December 2010. RESULTS: The recovery percent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was 5.9% in 2006 and 7.1% in 2010, and the recovery percent of NTM isolates was 2.0% in 2006 and 6.3% in 2010. The annual percent of NTM isolation has increased steadily every year (p for trend &lt; 0.001), and the proportion of patients from whom NTM was isolated increased from 21.4% in 2006 to 55.0% in 2010 (p for trend &lt; 0.001).

This results, in part, from incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. OBJECTIVES: To study pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions of multidrug treatment regimens in a large cohort of patients with MAC lung disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected pharmacokinetic data of all patients treated for MAC lung disease in the Adult Care Unit at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, in the January 2006 to January 2010 period; we retrospectively calculated areas under the time-concentration curve (AUC). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of their MAC isolates were retrieved for pharmacodynamic calculations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 531 pharmacokinetic analyses, performed for 481 patients (84% females; mean age, 63 yr; mean body mass index, 21.6). Peak serum concentrations (C(max)) below target range were frequent for ethambutol (48% of patients); clarithromycin (56%); and azithromycin (35%). Concurrent administration of rifampicin led to 68%, 23%, and 10% decreases in C(max) of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin. C(max)/MIC or AUC/MIC ratios associated with bactericidal activity were seldom met; 57% of patients achieved target ratios for ethambutol, versus 42% for clarithromycin, 19% for amikacin, 18% for rifampicin, and 11% for moxifloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Currently recommended regimens for MAC lung disease yield important pharmacologic interactions and low concentrations of key drugs including macrolides. Pharmacodynamic indices for rifampicin, clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin are seldom met. This may partly explain the poor outcomes of currently recommended treatment regimens.

METHODS: From July 2000 to August 2007, 369 patients (mean age 58.3 years; 169 males and 200 females) with pulmonary NTM infection were retrospectively reviewed. Of these 369 patients, 24 ICPs (mean age 64.8 years; 15 males and 9 females) were identified. 16 patients had diabetes mellitus, and 6 patients had received long-term steroid therapy. One had received solid organ transplantation and one had received high-dose chemotherapy for haematological disease. 24 age- and sex-matched immunocompetent patients (mean age 64.6 years; 15 males and 9 females) were selected as the control group from the same registry. CT images were reviewed in consensus by three chest radiologists, who were blinded to immune status. Each lung lobe was evaluated in terms of extent of the lesion, bronchiectasis, parenchymal opacity and the presence of ancillary findings. results: A total of 287 lobes were evaluated in ICPs and the control group. The ICPs showed a higher prevalence of ill-defined nodules, with cavities and large opacity &gt;2 cm with/without cavity (p=0.03, 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). Regardless of the immune status, the most common CT findings were bronchiectasis and ill-defined nodules without cavity.

One-liter water samples and swabs were collected from all taps, and swimming pools or rainwater tanks. Shower aerosols were sampled using Andersen six-stage cascade impactors. For a subgroup of patients, real-time PCR was performed and high-resolution melt profiles were compared to those of ATCC control strains. Pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from 19 homes. Species identified in the home matched that found in the patient in seven (35%) cases: M. abscessus (3 cases), M. avium (1 case), M. gordonae (1 case), M. lentiflavum (1 case), and M. kansasii (1 case). In an additional patient with M. abscessus infection, this species was isolated from potable water supplying her home.

Natural course on serial computed tomographic scans.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: Existing literature is inconclusive regarding how the nodular bronchiectatic form of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease will progress without treatment and when treatment initiation should be considered. OBJECTIVES: To assess the natural course of MAC pulmonary disease by serial thin-section computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Of 339 patients with nodular bronchiectatic form of MAC disease, we selected 265 untreated patients who had serial CTs (mean observation period, 32 +- 21 mo). Two independent chest radiologists reviewed retrospectively all CT scans for the presence and extent of lung abnormalities (maximal total score, 30). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 265 patients, 126 patients (48%) had disease that had progressed and that needed treatment owing to radiologic deterioration or worsening symptoms, and the remaining 139 patients (52%) did not. On multivariate analysis, the presence of cavity (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.06; P = 0.004) and consolidation (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; P = 0.019) at initial CT remained as independent factors associated with disease progression and treatment requirement. The presence of cavitary lesions demonstrated the highest positive predictive value (61%) and significant correlation (P = 0.005) with smear positivity. Differences in the extent of each pattern and total CT score in the serial studies were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.05) in patients requiring treatment. The total CT score increased by 2.41 in the treatment-requiring group compared with 0.25 in the group that did not receive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Without treatment, about half of patients demonstrate progressive disease on serial CT over a mean follow-up period of 32 months and, thus, required treatment. Patients showing cavities or consolidation on initial CT are more likely to have progressive disease and thus to require treatment eventually."

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL &lt;0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration."

Sputum culture repeatedly grew M brisbanense species nova, a novel species never before isolated in Malaysia. The case met the American Thoracic Society criteria for the diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. There was dramatic clinical and radiologic response to treatment with an empirical combination of rifampicin, ethambutol, and levofloxacin and subsequently clarithromycin and levofloxacin once sensitivity was known. This report is the first, to our knowledge, of the pathogen isolated in a patient with chronic cavitary lung infection since it was first identified from an antral sinus in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and the first time it is isolated from a human subject in Malaysia."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium szulgaiID:24740640TITLE:Surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.ABSTRACT:While the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been decreasing, the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease has been increasing. Unlike tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is not communicable. However, their indolent nature may result in extensive parenchymal destruction, causing respiratory failure and vulnerability to airway infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, therefore, has been becoming a significant health problem. According to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement on nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, the primary treatment is a multidrug treatment regimen. However, its efficacy is less than satisfactory for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, which is the most common type of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, and for Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease, which is notoriously resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The statement, therefore, has proposed a multidisciplinary treatment approach for these types of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases: a combination of multidrug treatment regimen and adjuvant resectional surgery. This review covers the rationale, indication, procedure, and outcome of surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. The rationale of surgery is to prevent disease progressing by removing the areas of lung most affected, harboring the largest amounts of mycobacteria. The indications for surgery include a poor response to drug therapy, the development of macrolide-resistant disease, or the presence of a significant disease-related complication such as hemoptysis. The surgical procedures of choice are various types of pulmonary resections, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. The reported series have achieved favorable treatment outcomes in surgically treated patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. "

Impression smears and histopathology confirmed pyogranulomatous pneumonia, with large amounts of lipid corresponding to the green structures noted cytologically, and identified poorly staining bacterial rods within lipid vacuoles. Special stains confirmed the presence of acid-fast bacterial rods, and polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing identified the organism as Mycobacterium fortuitum. M. fortuitum pneumonia is well described in humans and has previously been reported in 4 dogs and 1 cat. Lipid was a prominent cytologic and histologic feature, as is often described in humans and in the single feline case report.

The bacteriological characteristics of the strain were determined. METHODS: Species identification was performed by homologue gene sequence comparison, then a series of biochemical tests was conducted to elucidate the bacteriological characteristics. Drug susceptibility and pathogenicity to mice of the strain were tested. RESULTS: The clinical M. parascrofulaceum strain presented a very similar phenotypic profile to that of Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. The M. parascrofulaceum strain was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin in vitro. At week 2 post-infection, the lung tissues of mice demonstrated a local inflammatory response denoted by peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates. At weeks 4 and 8, the lung tissues showed peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates with large aggregates of lymphocytes and part of the tissue showed granulomatous lesions; there was no appreciable necrosis. The colony-forming units (CFU) count of infected lung and spleen increased gradually during the 8 weeks of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The M. parascrofulaceum strain isolated in China was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin. The mycobacteria were capable of proliferating in mice and could lead to pathological changes in the lungs of the mice."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary NTM infection and pulmonary NTM disease. METHODS: A retrospective review of the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens from January 2007 to May 2013. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were identified with at least one respiratory NTM isolate and 56 patients (46%) fulfilled the microbiological ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. Of patients with adequate data, 16% fulfilled the complete ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. The incidence of pulmonary NTM infection and disease was 18.9 and 8.8 per 100.000 inpatients and outpatients, respectively. The spectrum of NTM species was high (13 species) and predominated by M. avium-intracellulare complex (M. avium (13%), M. intracellulare (10%)), M. gordonae (14%), and M. fortuitum (12%). The ratio of isolation of NTM to M. tuberculosis in all hospitalized patients was 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: The first data on the epidemiology of pulmonary NTM in Athens, Greece, are presented.

We examined the risk factors associated with treatment outcome in Taiwanese adults with pulmonary disease caused by the M. abscessus complex. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients from a southern Taiwan medical center from 2006 to 2012 who had respiratory specimens identified as M. abscessus complex and met the American Thoracic Society criteria for pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Of the 106 included patients, females (58.5%) and nonsmokers (79.2%) predominated. The mean age of patients was 64.8 years. Sixty-three patients (59.4%) had pre-existing lung disease. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (34.9%) was the most common underlying disorder. Chest radiography indicated that bronchiectasis was common (47.2%) and that cavitations were less common (14.2%). Fifty-six patients received antibiotic treatment. Clinicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics if the initial sputum acid-fast staining was positive (p &lt; 0.001). Treatment outcome was analyzed in 26 patients who were treated for more than 3 months; three of these patients (11.5%) had clinical failure and 18 (69.2%) experienced sputum conversion. Patients with cavitary lesions were more likely to experience microbiologic failure (p = 0.02). Nine patients had positive cultures after antibiotic treatment for &gt; 1 year. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (p = 0.011) and cavitary lesion (p = 0.034) are risk factors for persistence of M. abscessus complex. CONCLUSION: With antimicrobial therapy, previous mycobacterial disease, and cavitary lesion are associated with microbiologic failure in Taiwanese adults with M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease."

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

We investigated the characteristics and clinical impact of NTM isolation in this population. Medical records of adult patients who underwent SCT at the blood and marrow transplantation center at a University Hospital in South Korea between January 2004 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five of 2,658 patients were enrolled, an incidence of 0.94%. The most common NTM species isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 15) and Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 5). Sixteen patients were co-infected with other pathogens, including Aspergillus species (10 cases). Nonspecific pneumonia and cavitary pneumonia were the most common radiologic patterns. Sixteen patients had underlying lung graft-versus-host disease, including bronchiolitis obliterans (10 cases) with moderate obstructive lung defects. Whereas two of 10 patients who were treated for NTM died as a result of NTM progression, one of 15 patients who were not treated died of the same cause. This study shows that the incidence of respiratory NTM detection in SCT recipients was low and its virulence was not higher than expected. As patients frequently had concomitant infections and underlying lung diseases that made radiologic evaluation more difficult, we suggest that it would be advantageous to perform repeated microbiologic studies when NTM infection is clinically suspected."

In total, 452 nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains isolated from patients with NTM lung diseases in four specialised TB hospitals were enrolled in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to evaluate the drug susceptibility of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM lung diseases caused by M. avium and M. intracellulare were analysed. Of 452 NTM isolates, M. intracellulare (188; 41.6%) was the most frequently isolated organism. The percentages of moxifloxacin- and linezolid-resistant strains among the M. intracellulare isolates were significantly lower than those among the M. avium group (P=0.003 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, M. avium harboured a lower proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains than M. intracellulare (P=0.005). Among patients with M. intracellulare lung diseases, the percentages of patients aged &gt;64 years and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significantly higher than among patients with M. avium (P=0.008 for age and P=0.001 for COPD). In conclusion, these data demonstrated that M. intracellulare was the most common NTM species in China. This study also revealed that M. intracellulare and M. avium differed in their drug susceptibility profiles. In addition, clinical cases of M. intracellulare lung diseases were more likely to be found in the aged population and among patients with COPD co-morbidity. "

Patients with cDGS and mycobacterial infection have not previously been described. We present this case to illustrate that patients with cDGS are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and to discuss further antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to thymic transplantation. METHODS: A 13-month old male was identified as T cell deficient by the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay on newborn screening, and was subsequently confirmed to have cDGS. He presented with fever and cough, and was treated for chronic aspiration pneumonia as well as Pneumocystis jirovecii infection without significant improvement. It was only after biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes seen on CT that the diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii was made. We reviewed the literature regarding atypical mycobacterial infections and prophylaxis used in other immunocompromised patients, as well as the current data regarding cDGS detection through TREC newborn screening. RESULTS: Multiple cases of cDGS have been diagnosed via TREC newborn screening, however this is the first patient with cDGS and disseminated mycobacterial infection to be reported in literature. Thymic transplantation is the definitive treatment of choice for cDGS. Prophylaxis with either clarithromycin or azithromycin has been shown to reduce mycobacterial infections in children with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cDGS should receive thymic transplantion as soon as possible, but prior to this are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Severe, opportunistic infections may require invasive testing for diagnosis in patients with cDGS. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered to prevent disseminated mycobacterial infection in these patients."

We present the first case of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-associated IRIS (MAC-IRIS) that was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old homosexual Japanese man was referred to our hospital with fever and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and found to be HIV positive. After the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the patient's mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy gradually enlarged, and bilateral infiltrates appeared in the upper lung fields. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed five months after the initiation of cART and showed intense accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) corresponding to the lesions of infiltration as well as the mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. A bronchial wash culture and pathology findings led to a diagnosis of MAC-IRIS. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy with rifampicin, ethambutol, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin was started. One year after the chemotherapy was initiated, there was a significant reduction in FDG uptake in the area of the lesions except in the mediastinal lymph node. This implied incomplete resolution of the MAC-IRIS-related inflammation. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy was continued because of the residual lesion. To date, the patient has not experienced a recurrence of MAC-IRIS, a period of nine months. CONCLUSION: We present a case of MAC-IRIS in an HIV-infected patient whose disease activity was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our data suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for evaluating the disease activity of NTM-IRIS and assessing the appropriate duration of anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy for NTM-IRIS in HIV-infected patients."

Previous reports have demonstrated that cervical lymphadenitis of children is the most frequent pathology of M. lentiflavum. However, there are little reports regarding pulmonary diseases by M. lentiflavum specifically in immunocompetent patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man having prolonged productive cough and dyspnea with fever was initially diagnosed as pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. Imaging studies showed that the radiologic abnormality was acute bronchopneumonic infiltration with abscess formation in the left lower lobe and parapneumonic pleural effusion. M. lentiflavum was identified in the cultured pleural tissues. On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed as pulmonary infection and pleurisy caused by M. lentiflavum, which was treated with a combination of antibiotics covering NTM. His clinical manifestations were dramatically improved by the treatment targeting NTM, while those were refractory to empirical antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: In this report, we introduce the isolation of M. lentiflavum from pleural tissues associated with acute necrotizing pneumonia combined with parapneumonic effusion in an immunocompetent host, suggesting that the M. lentiflavum can be a human pathogen invovled in pulmonary infectious diseases and pleurisy with poor response to empirical antibiotic treatment."

Pulmonary disease caused by NTM has emerged as a major threat to the health of individuals with CF but remains difficult to diagnose and problematic to treat. In response to this challenge, the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) convened an expert panel of specialists to develop consensus recommendations for the screening, investigation, diagnosis and management of NTM pulmonary disease in individuals with CF. Nineteen experts were invited to participate in the recommendation development process. Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) methodology and systematic literature reviews were employed to inform draft recommendations. An anonymous voting process was used by the committee to reach consensus. All committee members were asked to rate each statement on a scale of: 0, completely disagree, to 9, completely agree; with 80% or more of scores between 7 and 9 being considered 'good' agreement. Additionally, the committee solicited feedback from the CF communities in the USA and Europe and considered the feedback in the development of the final recommendation statements. Three rounds of voting were conducted to achieve 80% consensus for each recommendation statement. Through this process, we have generated a series of pragmatic, evidence-based recommendations for the screening, investigation, diagnosis and treatment of NTM infection in individuals with CF as an initial step in optimising management for this challenging condition.

Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility. METHODS: Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria. RESULTS: Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

We report, for the first time in Greece, the isolation of M. kumamotonense from an immunocompetent patient with pulmonary infection and latent tuberculosis. M. kumamotonense was identified by sequencing analysis of 16S rDNA and 65-kDa heat shock protein genes while by commercial molecular assays it was misidentified as Mycobacterium celatum. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method. The strain was susceptible to amikacin, clarithromycin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifabutin, ethambutol and linezolid. "

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients with ABPM focusing on the frequency of pNTM and cLRTIs, acute exacerbation of cLRTIs, and pneumonia. Results During a median follow-up period of 2,299 days (range, 118-6,138 days), 7 patients developed pNTM (mainly Mycobacterium avium complex), and 21 patients developed cLRTI (mostly from Staphylococcus aureus followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Twelve patients developed 21 episodes of acute exacerbation of cLRTIs, and 4 patients developed pneumonia. Conclusion Patients with ABPM can have concomitant NTM infection and, not uncommonly, cLRTI, and they can also sometimes develop pneumonia or an acute exacerbation of cLRTI. "

The development of molecular methods has allowed the characterization of new species and the identification of NTM to the precise species and subspecies levels. The incidence and prevalence of NTM lung disease are increasing worldwide, and this syndrome accounts for the majority of clinical cases of NTM disease. Common causative organisms of pulmonary infection are the slowly growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium kansasii and the rapidly growing mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex. NTM lung disease often affects elderly people with chronic lung disease and may be a manifestation of a complex genetic disorder determined by interactions among multiple genes, as well as environmental exposures. To be diagnosed with NTM lung disease, patients should meet all clinical and microbiologic criteria, but the decision to start treatment is complex, requiring careful individualized analysis of risks and benefits. Clinicians should be alert to the unique aspects of NTM lung disease, including the need for proper diagnosis, the availability of advanced molecular methods for species and subspecies identification, and the benefits and limitations of recommended treatments."

The emergence and reemergence of NTM are particularly worrying in developing countries due to scarce published data and improper identification. Here we aimed to examine the main epidemiological aspects and diagnostic challenges associated with NTM in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and compare these findings to the international arena findings. Data revealed that countries of the GCC are largely dominated by rapidly growing mycobacteria species such as M. fortuitum (29%) and M. abscessus (17%) with high rate of definitive respiratory diseases. On the other hand, most of the developed countries are dominated by slowly growing mycobacteria such as MAC, M. kansasii, and M. gordonae.

M.fortuitum can cause different types of disease including pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, cutaneous disease, and disseminated disease. However, the infection presenting as septicemia is exceedingly rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old immunocompromised male with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type was admitted to the hospital because of high fever for 10 days. DIAGNOSES: The pathogen identified twice in the hemoculture was M.fortuitum, but not in the sputum culture. The chest computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a chronic inflammatory infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin. OUTCOMES: The symptom of patient disappeared after the treatment for one week, and near-total absorption of the consolidation in CT after the treatment for one month. He continued the treatment for one year until the last negative hemoculture. LESSONS: Although the M.fortuitum infection presenting as septicemia is rare, a high suspicion of M.fortuitum is required, particularly in the immunosuppressive patients.

We selected 13 pathogens or syndromes implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks or other well-documented waterborne transmission (acute otitis externa, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), free-living ameba, Giardia, Hepatitis A virus, Legionella (Legionnaires' disease), nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Pseudomonas-related pneumonia or septicemia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio). We documented annual numbers of deaths in the United States associated with these infections using a combination of death certificate data, nationally representative hospital discharge data, and disease-specific surveillance systems (2003-2009). We documented 6,939 annual total deaths associated with the 13 infections; of these, 493 (7%) were caused by seven pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A total of 6,301 deaths (91%) were associated with infections from Pseudomonas, NTM, and Legionella, environmental pathogens that grow in water system biofilms. Biofilm-associated pathogens can cause illness following inhalation of aerosols or contact with contaminated water. These findings suggest that most mortality from these 13 selected infections in the United States does not result from classical fecal-oral transmission but rather from other transmission routes."

The microorganisms causing these infections most frequently are Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus complex. Their incidence has increased in the last three decades. After identifying an NTM in the respiratory tract, clinical and radiological aspects must be considered to determine if isolations are clinically relevant. Predisposing conditions that could contribute to infection must also be investigated. Pulmonary disease due to NTM is presented in three clinical forms: a) pneumonitis due to hypersensitivity; b) fibrocavitary form; and c) nodular-bronchiectasic. The diagnosis of respiratory disease due to NTM does not make it obligatory to immediately initiate treatment. Before initiating the latter, other factors must be considered, such as age, comorbidities, life expectancy, due to the prolonged nature of treatments, with potential side effects and, in many cases, only a slight response to the treatment."

However, little is known about the diagnostic indications for true M. fortuitum pulmonary infection and the natural history of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment against M. fortuitum pulmonary infection. Fifteen years before the referral, he underwent total gastrectomy, after which he experienced esophageal reflux symptoms. After the referral, the patient was closely monitored without antimicrobial therapy because of mild symptoms and no pathological evidence of M. fortuitum pulmonary infection. During the observation, chest imaging showed migratory infiltrates. Two years after the referral, his lung biopsy specimen revealed foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, indicating lipoid pneumonia. However, he was continually monitored without any treatment because there was no evidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Four years after the referral, he developed refractory pneumonia despite receiving adequate antibiotic therapy. After confirmation of granulomatous lesions, multiple antimicrobial therapy for M. fortuitum resulted in a remarkable improvement with no exacerbation for over 5 years. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed identical M. fortuitum strains in seven isolates from six sputum and one intestinal fluid specimens obtained during the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a patient with M. fortuitum pulmonary infection who presented with migratory infiltrates. The pathological evidence and microbiological analysis suggested that M. fortuitum pulmonary infection was associated with lipoid pneumonia and chronic exposure to gastrointestinal fluid. Therefore, physicians should carefully monitor patients with M. fortuitum detected from lower respiratory tract specimens and consider antimicrobial therapy for M. fortuitum infection when the patient does not respond to adequate antibiotic therapy against common pneumonia pathogens."

The prevalence of OIs differs among various countries in part due to different climates and socio-economic conditions. We, therefore, carried out the retrospective study at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan to comprehensively investigate the prevalence of OIs, predictors of OIs, and risk factors for in-hospital death among HIV-infected patients. Sichuan in West China is characterized by the largest population living with HIV/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) across China. In total, we reviewed 954 cases of HIV infection, admitted to the hospital during January 2014 to December 2015, and found that bacterial pneumonia (25.8%) was the most common OIs, followed by candida infection (18.3%), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (11.9%), tuberculosis (11.5%), infectious diarrhoea (9.3%), cryptococcus infection (7.3%), cytomegalovirus infection (4.9%), toxoplasmosis (4.6%), hepatitis C (4.0%), nontuberculous mycobacteria desease (2.2%) and Penicillium marneffei infection (0.3%). We also found two strongest risk factors for in-hospital mortality: CD4+T cell counts of less than 100 cells/muL and not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, the study revealed the specific pathogens causing bacterial pneumonia and/or candida infection, the effect of tuberculosis on CD4+T cell counts, and the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients.

Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of PNTM-associated CPA. In the present investigation, we aimed to elucidate the clinical course and prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 62 patients with CPA and a history of PNTM who were admitted to Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center between 2010 and 2015. Co-morbidities, causative microorganisms, radiological findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 69.5 years, and the median follow-up period was 4.2 years. The major underlying diseases, other than PNTM and CPA, were old pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia. The most common causative NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC; 37 patients; 59.7%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (20 patients; 32.3%). Survival was 83% after 1 year and 61% after 5 years. Use of systemic corticosteroids (hazard ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-9.51; P=0.00177) and C-reactive protein levels &gt;= 5.0 mg/dL (hazard ratio: 8.96, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-62.9; P=0.0014) at the time of CPA diagnosis were associated with increased over-all mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CPA frequently developed in patients with MAC and M. kansasii PNTM. The treatment course of PNTM was not associated with all-cause mortality. However, systemic corticosteroid use and high CRP levels were negative prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. Since the prognosis is poor, early diagnosis and treatment of CPA are important in patients with PNTM."

Mycobacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but in most cystic fibrosis centers it is performed less frequently than culture for other pathogens. Consensus today recommends just one annual mycobacterial culture for asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, a strategy likely to lead to diagnostic delays. Postponement of diagnosis might be the deciding factor in whether an early colonization turns into chronic infection. This review highlights the latest developments in knowledge about the pathogenicity and clinical consequences of M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease, addressing the central theme of why pulmonary infection requires early identification and aggressive antibiotic treatment. The window of opportunity, before M. abscessus complex transforms from a mucosal colonizer to a chronic biofilm infection, is where microbial eradication is most likely to be successful, making early diagnosis essential for improved outcomes."

The incidence of these tumors is increasing, but disease awareness remains low among clinicians. The synchronous presentation of lung cancer and mycobacterial infection is well known but the combination of pulmonary carcinoid and mycobacterial infection is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a 45-year-old female who presented with recurrent pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed a consolidation in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with various courses of antibiotics without full recovery after six months. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a central mass in the left upper lobe. Bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial, well-defined lesion that totally obstructed the left upper lobe bronchus. Bronchial biopsy showed typical carcinoid tumor. Rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery was attempted, but we were unable to radically remove the tumor. Therefore lobectomy was performed. The surgical pathology specimen showed atypical bronchial carcinoid and consolidations in the lung parenchyma with granulomatous inflammation distally of the bronchial obstruction. Ziehl-Neelsen staining demonstrated acid fast bacilli indicative of mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case history illustrates the importance of careful surgical pathologic examination, not only of the resected tumor, but also of the postobstructive lung parenchyma.

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

Previously reported cases of M. goodii infection have included prosthetic joint infections, pacemaker pocket infections, and pneumonia. We present a case of M. goodii bacteremia with concomitant pulmonary septic emboli that developed in a 32-year-old woman with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). The CVC had been placed one year previously for intermittent treatment with intravenous, broadspectrum antibiotics, administered by an outside physician for the treatment of symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease. Despite our recommendations, the patient declined follow-up in our Infectious Diseases clinic, opting to continue care under her chronic Lyme disease physician. This case clearly demonstrates the potential for serious medical complications that can arise from the inappropriate use of longterm intravenous antibiotics using a CVC to treat non-specific symptoms attributed to Lyme disease and patients should be counseled regarding these risks."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium szulgaiID:31690385TITLE:Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.ABSTRACT:Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis, and results in pulmonary infiltrates, tenacious mucus plugs that harbor hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus, elevations of total serum immunoglobulin E concentration and peripheral blood and sputum eosinophilia. Bronchiectasis is an irreversible complication of ABPA. The key to early diagnosis is to consider ABPA in anyone with asthma or cystic fibrosis and with a positive skin test result for Aspergillus, and/or recurrent infiltrates on radiographs. The differential diagnosis for ABPA in patients with asthma includes diseases in which there is an overlap of asthma, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and radiographic infiltrates. Examples include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, drug-induced pulmonary infiltrates, infection with a parasite, asthma with atelectasis, and lymphoma. Mucus plugging that causes a ""tree in bud"" pattern on computerized tomography examination of the lungs may be from ABPA or other conditions, such as nontuberculous (atypical) mycobacteria (Mycobacteria avium-Mycobacteria intracellulare complex). Prednisone is indicated to clear pulmonary infiltrates, and a usual course is for 3 months. Itraconazole and voriconazole are adjunctive, and drug-drug interactions must be considered because azoles decrease elimination of various medications. Although not familial in most patients, presentation of Aspergillus fumigatus f1 (Asp f1) antigen is restricted to specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR2 (HLA-DR2), and HLA-DR5. There is an increased number of CD4+ T-helper type 2 lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage, and A. fumigatus can serve as a growth factor of eosinophils potentiating the effects of interleukin (IL) 3, IL-5, and Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Eosinophils interact directly with A. fumigatus spores and generate extracellular traps, which can injure the bronchial epithelium."

Methods: From January 2016 to June 2018, a retrospective study was implemented in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Patients who received PTLB, suspected with lung infection were included. The basic information, clinical symptoms, imaging findings, diagnostic methods, complications, and changes in treatment of cases were collected. The diagnostic sensitivity of histopathology, microbial culture, and ROSE were evaluated at the same time. Results: A total of 529 cases were enrolled, including 354 males and 175 females, (59+-14) years old in average. Tuberculosis was identified in 197 cases, non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary disease in 8, cryptococcosis in 95, pulmonary aspergillosis in 27, filamentous fungal pneumonia in 3, talaromyces marneffei pulmonary infection in 3 and pulmonary candidiasis in 1, bacterial pneumonia in 39, and pathogen were unknown in 156 cases. A total of 417 cases were submitted for histopathology and microbial culture at the same time, the diagnostic value of pathology and microbial culture were 35.0% (146/417) and 45.6% (190/417), respectively. Combined pathology with microbial culture, the diagnostic value increased to 62.8% (262/417). The diagnostic accuracy of ROSE was 51.8% (71/137). The most common complication of PTLB was pneumothorax 26.1% (138/529). 56.1% (297/529) of the patients received targeted treatment after the diagnosis was confirmed, and 43.9% (232/529) maintained the original treatment. Conclusion: The pathology, microbial culture, and ROSE of PTLB have relative high diagnostic value for pulmonary infectious diseases."

Several studies have linked IgG4-RD to infections such as tuberculosis and actinomycosis. However, the coexistence of IgG4-RD and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) in a single pulmonary nodule has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old male patient presented with cough and sputum. A solitary pulmonary nodule suspicious of lung cancer was found on chest CT. DIAGNOSIS: Through video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy, a diagnosis of co-existing NTM and IgG4-RD in a single nodule was made. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was applied for pneumonia developed after surgery. The patient was also supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation since his pneumonia was refractory to medical treatment. OUTCOMES: The patient expired on the 60th postoperative day due to multiple organ failure. LESSONS: IgG4-RD can occur singularly or accompanied by other diseases. We report a solitary pulmonary nodule caused by NTM and concurrent IgG4-RD, suggesting a possible association between these 2 entities. Immunologic relations between IgG4-RD and accompanying infection should be further investigated."

NTM were identified in different clinical samples by microbiological culture and molecular-based methods. NTM were isolated from 14 patients, out of whom four (27%) were infected and were treated accordingly. Two were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), two with M. abscessus complex (MABSC) and one with M. intracellulare. Two patients had cystic fibrosis-related lung disease and improved after successful NTM eradication. One patient was HIV-positive and died. One patient had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-related pneumonia and is currently being followed-up. We conclude that NTM frequency in our center was low among pediatric patients. Whether this is inherent to Brazilian patients, due to the broad coverage of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine in Brazil, or a result of underdiagnosis remains to be elucidated."

In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

Given the limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of NTM treatment, this study aimed to evaluate the same among elderly patients. Material and methods: Patients diagnosed with NTM disease at a tertiary hospital from January 2007 to December 2017 were enrolled and data were then retrospectively collected. Data of elderly patients who received antimycobacterial treatment were then analyzed. Results: A total of 161 patients satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NTM disease. There were 40 elderly patients who received treatments. Of the patients, 60% received the guideline oriented standard regimens. Single drug regimens were administered to 22.5% of patients. Only 55.0% of the patients were able to continue any treatment. Treatment-related discontinuation was observed in 44.4% of discontinued or changed patients. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of patients with or without adverse events. Patients who were able to continue the treatment for >12 months had a lower proportion of activities of daily living (ADL) disability (nine in 18, 50.0% vs. three in 22, 13.6%, p = 0.018) and heart disease (six in 18, 33.3% vs. 1/22, 4.6%, p = 0.033). Sputum culture conversion was achieved in 28 out of 40 (70.0%) elderly patients treated, and those who achieved sputum culture conversion had more standard regimens prescribed than those who failed sputum culture conversion (21 in 28, 75% vs. 3 in 12, 25%; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Age may not be an obstacle for receiving the benefits of the treatment of NTM disease with a precise evaluation of patient's comorbidities. Furthermore, elderly patients without heart disease and ADL disability may have better rate of continuing the NTM treatment. The current study suggested that selecting standard regimens to treat pulmonary NTM is important for elderly patients."

However, a large-scale epidemiological study on this issue in Korea is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of NTM infection after lung transplant surgery in Korea. METHODS: Between October 2012 and December 2018, we retrospectively evaluated lung transplant recipients in a referral hospital in South Korea. A total of 215 recipients were enrolled. The median age at transplantation was 56 years (range, 17-75), and 62% were men. Bronchoscopy was performed according to the surveillance protocol and clinical indications. A diagnosis of NTM infection was defined as a positive NTM culture from a bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample, or two separate sputum samples. We determined NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America 2007 guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for conditional survival analysis in patients with follow-up of >=12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6.5%) were diagnosed with NTM infection at a median of 11.8 months (range, 0.3-51.4) after transplantation. Nine patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with NTM-PD, and the incidence rate was 1980/100,000 person-years. Mycobacterium abscessus was the most common species causing NTM-PD (66%), followed by M. avium complex (33%). The presence of NTM infection did not influence all-cause mortality among those who underwent follow-up for >=12 months (N = 133, log-rank P = 0.816). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM-PD was considerably high among lung-transplant recipients. M. abscessus was the most common causative species of NTM-PD after lung transplantation."

Most cases occur during lactation and are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species; parasites and Mycobacteria have rarely been reported to cause breast infections (Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases (9th edn);2019, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007;175:367). Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which are also referred to as atypical mycobacteria, mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT), or environmental mycobacteria are a large group of Mycobacteria which are becoming increasingly common cause of infection all over the world (Arch Dermatol. 2006;142:1287). NTM can cause infection diseases especially in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-positive hosts, most commonly in the lungs, skin and soft tissue, lymph nodes or rarely spread with multiorgan dissemination (Arch Plast Surg. 2014;41:759). Mycobacterium gordonae (M. gordonae) is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium that is considered the least pathogenic NTM. The organism is ubiquitous, and mostly isolated from soil and water. Despite its nonvirulent nature, clinically significant infections have been reported also in some immunocompetent patients (J Formosan Med Assoc. 2020, Clin Infect Dis. 1992;1229).

The morphological characteristics of the bronchial lesions included scar stenosis or atresia in 63 cases (63/89, 71%), hyperemia and edema in 46 cases (46/89, 52%), and multiple types of lesions in 48 cases (48/89, 54%). Conclusions: Patients with NTM lung disease complicated with tracheobronchial inflammatory lesions did not have specific manifestations clinically. Lung lesions are extensive, often accompanied by bronchiectasis and cavity formation. Endoscopic changes were mostly manifested as multilobar tracheobronchial involvement characterized by scar stenosis, congestion and edema, mainly involving bilateral upper bronchi and the right lower bronchus."

Materials and Methods: Between July 2016 and February 2019, 18 cases of NTM were diagnosed and their relevant clinical, diagnostic, and treatment details were recorded after taking informed consent. Results: We report 18 cases of NTM involving lungs (n = 11), skin and soft tissue (n = 3), joint (n = 2), genitourinary (n = 1), and central nervous system (n = 1). History of immunosuppression was present in two patients, whereas history of some form of intervention was seen in six patients. Mycobacterium fortuitum group (n = 5) was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 4), Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 3), Mycobacterium kansasii (n = 2), and Mycobacterium chelonae (n = 1). In two patients, M. chelonae and M. abscessus were isolated in succession. Of these 18 patients, clinical response was present in 15 of the patients. Diagnosis and treatment of NTM in resource limited settings is extremely challenging. Conclusion: Most of the patients with NTM are misdiagnosed and are treated as tuberculosis in India, sometimes with a multidrug resistance regimen, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. We present these cases to shed some light on the epidemiology of NTM in this part of India."

However, studies about extrapulmonary NTM infections have been limited. Therefore, we aim to describe the diversity of extrapulmonary NTM infections and identify predictors for species. Information regarding diversity of NTM isolates, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, treatment regimens, and outcomes were collected from four tertiary care centers in South Korea. Comparisons were made between patients with rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) and slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM) infections. A total of 117 patients (46 males vs. 71 females) were included. Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) predominated (34.2%), followed by bone and joint infections (28.2%). In SSTIs, RGM species were predominantly identified (26/28, 92.9%), whereas SGM species were mainly identified in bone and joint infections (18/26, 69.2%), and the difference of isolated sites was verified by a post hoc test (p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that male sex (vs. female sex; OR 5.30, CI 1.35-24.26, p = 0.020) and bone and joint infections (vs. SSTIs; OR 18.10, CI 3.28-157.07, p = 0.002) were predictors of SGM infections, whereas the opposite was observed for RGM infections. Bone and joint infections and male sex were predictors for SGM infections, whereas SSTIs and female sex were predictors for RGM infections."

It is susceptible to multiple antibiotics both in vitro and in clinical practice, so that any combination of susceptible drugs is effective. However, we encountered a case of infection due to fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum. In this study, we report the case and describe the mechanism of resistance. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man with a history of total gastrectomy and immunosuppressant treatment for rheumatoid arthritis developed a recurrence of pulmonary infection caused by M. fortuitum. He was treated with clarithromycin and levofloxacin as a first-line treatment, based on the favorable susceptibility at that time. After recurrence, a high minimum inhibitory concentration to fluoroquinolones was detected. DNA sequencing of the pathogen showed the substitution of serine for tryptophan at residue 83 in the gyrA gene. He was successfully treated with a combination of other antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum and investigation of the mechanism of resistance. We suggest that the susceptibility test remains effective for determining the next line of treatment after a pathogen has acquired resistance, and resistance to fluoroquinolones in M. fortuitum can be attributed to a single change of amino acid."

Recent advances in analysis techniques have allowed the accurate identification of previously unknown NTM species. Here, we report a case of NTM-PD caused by a newly identified mycobacteria in an immunocompetent patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to the frequent aggravation of her chronic respiratory symptoms, with NTM-PD-compatible computed tomography findings. Unidentified mycobacterium was repeatedly isolated from respiratory specimens and we diagnosed her as NTM-PD of unidentified mycobacterium. Subsequent whole-genome analysis revealed that the unidentified mycobacterium was a novel mycobacterium genetically close to Mycolicibacterium mucogenicum. We started combination therapy with clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, and imipenem/cilastatin, referring to drug sensitivity test results and observed its effect on M. mucogenicum infection. Her symptoms and radiological findings improved significantly. CONCLUSION: We report a case of NTM-PD caused by a newly identified mycobacteria, Mycolicibacterium toneyamachuris, genetically close to M. mucogenicum. This pathogenic mycobacterium showed different characteristics from M. mucogenicum about clinical presentation and drug sensitivity. The clinical application of genomic sequencing will advance the identification and classification of pathogenic NTM species, and enhance our understanding of mycobacterial diseases."

NTM lung disease has been identified as a predictor of mortality in CPA patients. The major risk factors for NTM-associated CPA include fibrocavitary NTM lung disease, the presence of pulmonary emphysema, and high-dose corticosteroid use. The onset of CPA is 1.5-7 years following the diagnosis of NTM lung disease. The diagnosis can be made using standard criteria; however, serological diagnosis using Aspergillus precipitin has demonstrated a higher sensitivity and specificity when compared with fungal culture from respiratory specimens. Treatment is challenging since rifampicin and oral triazoles should not be used concomitantly. The prognosis is poor, and the factors associated with worse prognosis are corticosteroid use and high C-reactive protein level."

A 67-year-old man with NTM presented with recurrent haemoptysis. Computed tomography of the chest revealed pulmonary mycetoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, and culture of bronchial washing fluid yielded S. apiospermum. Oral voriconazole therapy ameliorated both haemoptysis and mycetoma findings. As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case of S. apiospermum lung disease in a patient with NTM but without tuberculosis. The possibility of S. apiospermum infection should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary mycetoma. Although S. apiospermum mycetoma resembles aspergilloma, antifungal strategies for these two conditions differ, with the collection of culture specimens such as by bronchoscopy being compulsory for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of S. apiospermum infection."

Of these, 12 were reports of pseudo-outbreaks, i.e., the nosocomial transmission of organism from hospital ice/ice machines to patients, resulting in patient colonization, but with no disease manifestations. In addition, there were five outbreaks that resulted in clinical disease/pathology associated with NTM organism. Eleven different species of NTMs have been associated with these reports, where over half (59%) of the species identified were Mycobacterium fortuitum (18%), Mycobacterium gordonae (14%), Mycobacterium mucogenicum (14%), and Mycobacterium porcinum (14%). Several of these reports clearly documented that ice machines had been properly maintained, cleaned, and serviced in accordance with the CDC guidelines yet became contaminated with NTM organisms. These reports frequently detail that after extensive cleaning/disinfection following the discovery of NTM organisms, ice machines remained contaminated with NTM organisms, highlighting the difficulty in eradicating these from ice machines, once contaminated. Several reports identified that the only remedy to the contamination problem was to replace the ice machine with a new machine. Two qualitative risk assessment models are presented for (i) patients exposed to contaminated ice machine but before NTM colonization/infection and (ii) patients already colonized with NTMs from ice machines. Therefore, to protect immunocompromised/immunosuppressed patients' safety, especially during surgical or respiratory procedures, ice should not be sourced from the ice machine but should be made from sterile water and stored safely and separately away from the ice machine."

Associations were evaluated among residents of central North Carolina between pulmonary isolation of NTM and environmental risk factors including: surface water, drinking water source, urbanicity, and exposures to soils favorable to NTM growth. Reports of pulmonary NTM isolation from patients residing in three counties in central North Carolina during 2006-2010 were collected from clinical laboratories and from the State Laboratory of Public Health. This analysis was restricted to patients residing in single family homes with a valid residential street address and conducted at the census block level (n = 13,495 blocks). Negative binomial regression models with thin-plate spline smoothing function of geographic coordinates were applied to assess effects of census block-level environmental characteristics on pulmonary NTM isolation count. Patients (n = 507) resided in 473 (3.4%) blocks within the study area. Blocks with >20% hydric soils had 26.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8%, 58.0%), p = 0.03, higher adjusted mean patient counts compared to blocks with <=20% hydric soil, while blocks with >50% acidic soil had 24.8% (-2.4%, 59.6%), p = 0.08 greater mean patient count compared to blocks with <=50% acidic soil. Isolation rates varied by county after adjusting for covariates. The effects of using disinfected public water supplies vs. private wells, and of various measures of urbanicity were not significantly associated with NTM. Our results suggest that proximity to certain soil types (hydric and acidic) could be a risk factor for pulmonary NTM isolation in central North Carolina."

Four distinct clinical syndromes associated with NTM infection have been described: skin and soft tissue disease, lymphadenitis, disseminated disease and pulmonary disease. In children, lymphadenitis is the most common NTM clinical entity, particularly affecting those aged 1-5 years who have no known risk factors for disease. Optimal management of NTM lymphadenitis is not entirely clear, although surgical intervention is likely a definitive therapy. Disseminated NTM disease is uncommon and only seen in the setting of immunocompromise. In previously well children, this presentation should always lead to consideration of an underlying immune defect, such as Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. Identification of the underlying cause enables more targeted therapy and better prognostic understanding. Pulmonary NTM disease is fundamentally different to the other clinical syndromes, presenting in different hosts, who have different comorbidities, and follow a different clinical course."

During the study period, 50 patients with hematological malignancy and tuberculosis (TB) were also evaluated. Among 2,846 patients with hematological malignancy, 34 (1.2%) patients had NTM infections. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (13 patients, 38%) was the most commonly isolated species, followed by M. abscessus (21%), M. fortuitum (18%), and M. kansasii (18%). Twenty-six patients had pulmonary NTM infection and eight patients had disseminated disease. Neutropenia was more frequently encountered among patients with disseminated NTM disease (p = 0.007) at diagnosis than among patients with pulmonary disease only. Twenty-five (74%) patients received adequate initial antibiotic treatment. Five of the 34 patients died within 30 days after diagnosis. Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that chronic kidney disease (p = 0.017) and neutropenia at diagnosis (p = 0.032) were independent prognostic factors of NTM infection in patients with hematological malignancy.

Both patients were initially treated with anti-tuberculous drugs before the identification of M. genavense on sputum or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid culture. A four-drug regimen including clarithromycin and rifabutin was started. Gamma interferon has been helpful in addition to antimycobacterial treatment for one patient.

Exacerbation of infectious pneumonitis and interstitial pneumonia required complementary inpatient treatment in August 2007. Although polymerase chain reaction examination of expectorated sputa revealed the absence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. intracellulare on admission, nontuberculous M. abscessus was detected in the routine blood cultures. Taken together with clinical findings, M. abscessus was most likely the primary causative organism. Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be highly helpful for diagnosis."

NTM are ubiquitous environmental pathogens with high isolation rates worldwide. The greater frequency of NTM associated with pulmonary diseases is probably due to a combination of increased exposure, improved diagnostic methods and an increase in the prevalence of risk factors predisposing individuals to infection. Difficulty may arise in determining whether an isolate from a respiratory sample is in fact a contaminant or a pathogenic organism. The ATS/IDSA guidelines highlight the importance of following microbiological and clinical criteria in making a diagnosis of NTM lung infection. These criteria may not be useful for all NTM and species-level identification is strongly recommended. Mycobacteria identification by conventional methods has been the standard in most clinical microbiology laboratories. However, conventional testing alone does not allow identification of many NTM. Newer, rapid molecular methods such as commercially available nucleic acid probes, genomic amplification and DNA sequence analysis should be used. Communication between the clinician and the laboratorian is essential to decide whether an isolate could be sent to a reference laboratory to determine the best method for species identification. Although the CLSI has recently published an approved standard for NTM susceptibility testing, there is ongoing debate about the role of in vitro susceptibility for managing patients with NTM disease. The goal of this review is to describe the mycobacteria involved in lung disease, the factors that predispose to this infection, its diagnosis with alternative procedures and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response."

We investigated the trends of NTM lung disease at a tertiary hospital in Korea and evaluated the contribution of liquid culture systems. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of mycobacterial cultures of respiratory specimens from 26,793 patients at Severance Hospital in South Korea from January 2006 to December 2010. RESULTS: The recovery percent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was 5.9% in 2006 and 7.1% in 2010, and the recovery percent of NTM isolates was 2.0% in 2006 and 6.3% in 2010. The annual percent of NTM isolation has increased steadily every year (p for trend &lt; 0.001), and the proportion of patients from whom NTM was isolated increased from 21.4% in 2006 to 55.0% in 2010 (p for trend &lt; 0.001).

This results, in part, from incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. OBJECTIVES: To study pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions of multidrug treatment regimens in a large cohort of patients with MAC lung disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected pharmacokinetic data of all patients treated for MAC lung disease in the Adult Care Unit at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, in the January 2006 to January 2010 period; we retrospectively calculated areas under the time-concentration curve (AUC). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of their MAC isolates were retrieved for pharmacodynamic calculations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 531 pharmacokinetic analyses, performed for 481 patients (84% females; mean age, 63 yr; mean body mass index, 21.6). Peak serum concentrations (C(max)) below target range were frequent for ethambutol (48% of patients); clarithromycin (56%); and azithromycin (35%). Concurrent administration of rifampicin led to 68%, 23%, and 10% decreases in C(max) of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin. C(max)/MIC or AUC/MIC ratios associated with bactericidal activity were seldom met; 57% of patients achieved target ratios for ethambutol, versus 42% for clarithromycin, 19% for amikacin, 18% for rifampicin, and 11% for moxifloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Currently recommended regimens for MAC lung disease yield important pharmacologic interactions and low concentrations of key drugs including macrolides. Pharmacodynamic indices for rifampicin, clarithromycin, amikacin, and moxifloxacin are seldom met. This may partly explain the poor outcomes of currently recommended treatment regimens.

One had received solid organ transplantation and one had received high-dose chemotherapy for haematological disease. 24 age- and sex-matched immunocompetent patients (mean age 64.6 years; 15 males and 9 females) were selected as the control group from the same registry. CT images were reviewed in consensus by three chest radiologists, who were blinded to immune status. Each lung lobe was evaluated in terms of extent of the lesion, bronchiectasis, parenchymal opacity and the presence of ancillary findings. results: A total of 287 lobes were evaluated in ICPs and the control group. The ICPs showed a higher prevalence of ill-defined nodules, with cavities and large opacity &gt;2 cm with/without cavity (p=0.03, 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). Regardless of the immune status, the most common CT findings were bronchiectasis and ill-defined nodules without cavity. CONCLUSION: The most common CT findings of pulmonary NTM infection in ICPs were bronchiectasis and ill-defined nodules, similar to those in the control group. Ill-defined nodules with cavity and large opacity &gt;2 cm with/without cavity were more frequently found in ICPs. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: In patients affected by NTM infection, large opacities and cavitation in pulmonary nodules are more frequent in ICPs than in immunocompetent patients."

This study examined household water and shower aerosols of patients with NTM pulmonary disease. The mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples from 20 patients included M. avium (5 patients), M. intracellulare (12 patients), M. abscessus (7 patients), M. gordonae (1 patient), M. lentiflavum (1 patient), M. fortuitum (1 patient), M. peregrinum (1 patient), M. chelonae (1 patient), M. triplex (1 patient), and M. kansasii (1 patient). One-liter water samples and swabs were collected from all taps, and swimming pools or rainwater tanks. Shower aerosols were sampled using Andersen six-stage cascade impactors. For a subgroup of patients, real-time PCR was performed and high-resolution melt profiles were compared to those of ATCC control strains. Pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from 19 homes. Species identified in the home matched that found in the patient in seven (35%) cases: M. abscessus (3 cases), M. avium (1 case), M. gordonae (1 case), M. lentiflavum (1 case), and M. kansasii (1 case). In an additional patient with M. abscessus infection, this species was isolated from potable water supplying her home. NTM grown from aerosols included M. abscessus (3 homes), M. gordonae (2 homes), M. kansasii (1 home), M. fortuitum complex (4 homes), M. mucogenicum (1 home), and M. wolinskyi (1 home). NTM causing human disease can be isolated from household water and aerosols. The evidence appears strongest for M. avium, M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, and M. abscessus. Despite a predominance of disease due to M. intracellulare, we found no evidence for acquisition of infection from household water for this species. "

In contrast, the Para state of north Brazil represents an area of high tuberculosis prevalence and increasing NTM incidence. Toward the goal of understanding the dynamics of infection by all Mycobacterium species, we report patient characteristics and the identification of NTM strains isolated from sputum samples from patients that were residents of Para, a state in the Amazon region, Northern of Brazil, over the period January 2010 through December 2011 (2 years). The 29 NTM patients comprised 13.5% of positive mycobacterial cultures over the 2-year period. A major risk factor for NTM pulmonary disease was previous tuberculosis (76%). Further, the average age of NTM patients (52 years) was significantly higher than that of tuberculosis patients (39 years) and more were female (72.4% vs. 37.4%). Unlike other Brazilian states, NTM pulmonary patients in Para were infected with a different spectrum of mycobacteria; primarily the rapidly growing Mycobacterium massiliense and Mycobacterium simiae complex.

Natural course on serial computed tomographic scans.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: Existing literature is inconclusive regarding how the nodular bronchiectatic form of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease will progress without treatment and when treatment initiation should be considered. OBJECTIVES: To assess the natural course of MAC pulmonary disease by serial thin-section computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Of 339 patients with nodular bronchiectatic form of MAC disease, we selected 265 untreated patients who had serial CTs (mean observation period, 32 +- 21 mo). Two independent chest radiologists reviewed retrospectively all CT scans for the presence and extent of lung abnormalities (maximal total score, 30). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 265 patients, 126 patients (48%) had disease that had progressed and that needed treatment owing to radiologic deterioration or worsening symptoms, and the remaining 139 patients (52%) did not. On multivariate analysis, the presence of cavity (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.06; P = 0.004) and consolidation (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; P = 0.019) at initial CT remained as independent factors associated with disease progression and treatment requirement. The presence of cavitary lesions demonstrated the highest positive predictive value (61%) and significant correlation (P = 0.005) with smear positivity. Differences in the extent of each pattern and total CT score in the serial studies were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.05) in patients requiring treatment. The total CT score increased by 2.41 in the treatment-requiring group compared with 0.25 in the group that did not receive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Without treatment, about half of patients demonstrate progressive disease on serial CT over a mean follow-up period of 32 months and, thus, required treatment. Patients showing cavities or consolidation on initial CT are more likely to have progressive disease and thus to require treatment eventually."

Chest auscultation revealed an expiratory wheezing with decreased right-sided breath sounds. Chest imaging revealed subcarinal adenopathy and a nodule in the right principal bronchus (RB). Bronchoscopy showed a major obstruction of the RB by a granuloma, and a smaller granuloma in the left principal bronchus. The granulation tissue was removed by laser section. Histological examination revealed a necrotising granulomatous inflammation, culture showed a Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Tests to rule out tuberculosis and immunodeficiency were negative. The diagnosis of an MAC endobronchial granuloma was ascertained and a multidrug therapy associating clarithromycin, rifampin and ethambutol was started. The clinical outcome was good after 3 months of treatment and the bronchoscopy normalised after 1 year. Although rare, the frequency of MAC respiratory infections in immunocompetent children can increase. Reporting these cases should help to optimise diagnosis and treatment. "

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common causative agents but the diagnosis of MAC-LD remains challenging. Detection of serum IgA antibody against MAC glycopeptidolipid (GPL) has recently been shown to improve the diagnosis of MAC-LD, but has yet to be validated worldwide. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in northern Taiwan and enrolled patients with MAC-LD, MAC contamination, other lung diseases, and control subjects. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody against MAC-GPL was detected in the participants and its specificity and sensitivity was assessed. RESULTS: There were 56 patients with MAC-LD, 11 with MAC contamination, 13 M. kansasii-LD, 26 LD due to rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), 48 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 42 household contacts of patients with TB. Patients with MAC-LD were older and 32% of them had an underlying co-morbidity. By logistic regression, serum MAC-GPL IgA level was an independent predictor of MAC-LD among the study subjects and those with culture-positive specimens for MAC. By the receiver operating characteristic curve, serum MAC-GPL IgA had a good power to discriminate MAC-LD from MAC contamination. Under the optimal cut-off value of 0.73 U/mL, its sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 91%, respectively. Among MAC-LD patients, presence of co-morbidity was associated with MAC-GPL &lt;0.73 U/ml in logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum anti-MAC-GPL IgA level is useful for the diagnosis of MAC-LD. However, its implement in clinical practice for immuno-compromised hosts needs careful consideration."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium terraeID:24740640TITLE:Surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.ABSTRACT:While the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis has been decreasing, the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease has been increasing. Unlike tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease is not communicable. However, their indolent nature may result in extensive parenchymal destruction, causing respiratory failure and vulnerability to airway infection. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, therefore, has been becoming a significant health problem. According to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement on nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases, the primary treatment is a multidrug treatment regimen. However, its efficacy is less than satisfactory for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease, which is the most common type of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases, and for Mycobacterium abscessus lung disease, which is notoriously resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The statement, therefore, has proposed a multidisciplinary treatment approach for these types of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung diseases: a combination of multidrug treatment regimen and adjuvant resectional surgery. This review covers the rationale, indication, procedure, and outcome of surgical treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. The rationale of surgery is to prevent disease progressing by removing the areas of lung most affected, harboring the largest amounts of mycobacteria. The indications for surgery include a poor response to drug therapy, the development of macrolide-resistant disease, or the presence of a significant disease-related complication such as hemoptysis. The surgical procedures of choice are various types of pulmonary resections, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. The reported series have achieved favorable treatment outcomes in surgically treated patients with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. "

The bacteriological characteristics of the strain were determined. METHODS: Species identification was performed by homologue gene sequence comparison, then a series of biochemical tests was conducted to elucidate the bacteriological characteristics. Drug susceptibility and pathogenicity to mice of the strain were tested. RESULTS: The clinical M. parascrofulaceum strain presented a very similar phenotypic profile to that of Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. The M. parascrofulaceum strain was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin in vitro. At week 2 post-infection, the lung tissues of mice demonstrated a local inflammatory response denoted by peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates. At weeks 4 and 8, the lung tissues showed peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates with large aggregates of lymphocytes and part of the tissue showed granulomatous lesions; there was no appreciable necrosis. The colony-forming units (CFU) count of infected lung and spleen increased gradually during the 8 weeks of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The M. parascrofulaceum strain isolated in China was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin. The mycobacteria were capable of proliferating in mice and could lead to pathological changes in the lungs of the mice."

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients from a southern Taiwan medical center from 2006 to 2012 who had respiratory specimens identified as M. abscessus complex and met the American Thoracic Society criteria for pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Of the 106 included patients, females (58.5%) and nonsmokers (79.2%) predominated. The mean age of patients was 64.8 years. Sixty-three patients (59.4%) had pre-existing lung disease. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (34.9%) was the most common underlying disorder. Chest radiography indicated that bronchiectasis was common (47.2%) and that cavitations were less common (14.2%). Fifty-six patients received antibiotic treatment. Clinicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics if the initial sputum acid-fast staining was positive (p &lt; 0.001). Treatment outcome was analyzed in 26 patients who were treated for more than 3 months; three of these patients (11.5%) had clinical failure and 18 (69.2%) experienced sputum conversion. Patients with cavitary lesions were more likely to experience microbiologic failure (p = 0.02). Nine patients had positive cultures after antibiotic treatment for &gt; 1 year. Previous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (p = 0.011) and cavitary lesion (p = 0.034) are risk factors for persistence of M. abscessus complex.

Patients with a single isolate of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. chelonae-abscessus, M. kansasii, or M. fortuitum from at least three sputum samples collected within 1 month were retrospectively identified. Those with follow-up sputum samples within 1 year were included in the analysis. Among the 202 patients included, M. fortuitum (n = 71, 35.1%) and MAC (n = 70, 34.7%) were the most common NTM species isolated, followed by M. chelonae-abscessus (n = 40, 19.8%) and M. kansasii (n = 21, 10.4%). The mean clinical follow-up period was 26.2 months. Forty-four patients (21.8%) had subsequent positive cultures of the same NTM species, while eight (4.0%) had bronchiectasis and developed NTM lung disease (NTM-LD). Neither patients without bronchiectasis nor those with M. fortuitum subsequently developed NTM lung disease. Among bronchiectatic patients with NTM other than M. fortuitum, age &lt;=65 years (p 0.006, OR 32.13), malignancy (p 0.048, OR 14.35), and initial radiographic score &gt;2 (p 0.027, OR 20.06) were associated with subsequent NTM-LD. In all of the NTM patients, bronchiectasis (p &lt;0.001, OR 5.46) and age &lt;=65 years (p 0.002, OR 3.29) were significantly associated with subsequent positive NTM culture. In patients with a single isolation of NTM from respiratory specimens, the presence of bronchiectasis and younger age indicates higher risk of subsequent culture-positivity and NTM-LD. Single isolation of M. fortuitum is of little clinical significance. Other patients with NTM, younger age, and more severe radiographic pulmonary lesion also warrant further attention."

We investigated the characteristics and clinical impact of NTM isolation in this population. Medical records of adult patients who underwent SCT at the blood and marrow transplantation center at a University Hospital in South Korea between January 2004 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-five of 2,658 patients were enrolled, an incidence of 0.94%. The most common NTM species isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex (n = 15) and Mycobacterium abscessus (n = 5). Sixteen patients were co-infected with other pathogens, including Aspergillus species (10 cases). Nonspecific pneumonia and cavitary pneumonia were the most common radiologic patterns. Sixteen patients had underlying lung graft-versus-host disease, including bronchiolitis obliterans (10 cases) with moderate obstructive lung defects. Whereas two of 10 patients who were treated for NTM died as a result of NTM progression, one of 15 patients who were not treated died of the same cause. This study shows that the incidence of respiratory NTM detection in SCT recipients was low and its virulence was not higher than expected. As patients frequently had concomitant infections and underlying lung diseases that made radiologic evaluation more difficult, we suggest that it would be advantageous to perform repeated microbiologic studies when NTM infection is clinically suspected."

In total, 452 nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains isolated from patients with NTM lung diseases in four specialised TB hospitals were enrolled in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to evaluate the drug susceptibility of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM lung diseases caused by M. avium and M. intracellulare were analysed. Of 452 NTM isolates, M. intracellulare (188; 41.6%) was the most frequently isolated organism. The percentages of moxifloxacin- and linezolid-resistant strains among the M. intracellulare isolates were significantly lower than those among the M. avium group (P=0.003 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). In contrast, M. avium harboured a lower proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains than M. intracellulare (P=0.005). Among patients with M. intracellulare lung diseases, the percentages of patients aged &gt;64 years and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significantly higher than among patients with M. avium (P=0.008 for age and P=0.001 for COPD). In conclusion, these data demonstrated that M. intracellulare was the most common NTM species in China. This study also revealed that M. intracellulare and M. avium differed in their drug susceptibility profiles. In addition, clinical cases of M. intracellulare lung diseases were more likely to be found in the aged population and among patients with COPD co-morbidity. "

RESULTS: Multiple cases of cDGS have been diagnosed via TREC newborn screening, however this is the first patient with cDGS and disseminated mycobacterial infection to be reported in literature. Thymic transplantation is the definitive treatment of choice for cDGS. Prophylaxis with either clarithromycin or azithromycin has been shown to reduce mycobacterial infections in children with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cDGS should receive thymic transplantion as soon as possible, but prior to this are at risk for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Severe, opportunistic infections may require invasive testing for diagnosis in patients with cDGS. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered to prevent disseminated mycobacterial infection in these patients."

We present the first case of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)-associated IRIS (MAC-IRIS) that was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old homosexual Japanese man was referred to our hospital with fever and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and found to be HIV positive. After the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the patient's mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy gradually enlarged, and bilateral infiltrates appeared in the upper lung fields. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed five months after the initiation of cART and showed intense accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) corresponding to the lesions of infiltration as well as the mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. A bronchial wash culture and pathology findings led to a diagnosis of MAC-IRIS. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy with rifampicin, ethambutol, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin was started. One year after the chemotherapy was initiated, there was a significant reduction in FDG uptake in the area of the lesions except in the mediastinal lymph node. This implied incomplete resolution of the MAC-IRIS-related inflammation. Anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy was continued because of the residual lesion. To date, the patient has not experienced a recurrence of MAC-IRIS, a period of nine months. CONCLUSION: We present a case of MAC-IRIS in an HIV-infected patient whose disease activity was successfully followed up using 18F-FDG PET/CT. Our data suggest that 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for evaluating the disease activity of NTM-IRIS and assessing the appropriate duration of anti-mycobacterial chemotherapy for NTM-IRIS in HIV-infected patients."

Previous reports have demonstrated that cervical lymphadenitis of children is the most frequent pathology of M. lentiflavum. However, there are little reports regarding pulmonary diseases by M. lentiflavum specifically in immunocompetent patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man having prolonged productive cough and dyspnea with fever was initially diagnosed as pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion. Imaging studies showed that the radiologic abnormality was acute bronchopneumonic infiltration with abscess formation in the left lower lobe and parapneumonic pleural effusion. M. lentiflavum was identified in the cultured pleural tissues. On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed as pulmonary infection and pleurisy caused by M. lentiflavum, which was treated with a combination of antibiotics covering NTM. His clinical manifestations were dramatically improved by the treatment targeting NTM, while those were refractory to empirical antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: In this report, we introduce the isolation of M. lentiflavum from pleural tissues associated with acute necrotizing pneumonia combined with parapneumonic effusion in an immunocompetent host, suggesting that the M. lentiflavum can be a human pathogen invovled in pulmonary infectious diseases and pleurisy with poor response to empirical antibiotic treatment."

Pulmonary disease caused by NTM has emerged as a major threat to the health of individuals with CF but remains difficult to diagnose and problematic to treat. In response to this challenge, the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) convened an expert panel of specialists to develop consensus recommendations for the screening, investigation, diagnosis and management of NTM pulmonary disease in individuals with CF. Nineteen experts were invited to participate in the recommendation development process. Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) methodology and systematic literature reviews were employed to inform draft recommendations. An anonymous voting process was used by the committee to reach consensus. All committee members were asked to rate each statement on a scale of: 0, completely disagree, to 9, completely agree; with 80% or more of scores between 7 and 9 being considered 'good' agreement. Additionally, the committee solicited feedback from the CF communities in the USA and Europe and considered the feedback in the development of the final recommendation statements. Three rounds of voting were conducted to achieve 80% consensus for each recommendation statement. Through this process, we have generated a series of pragmatic, evidence-based recommendations for the screening, investigation, diagnosis and treatment of NTM infection in individuals with CF as an initial step in optimising management for this challenging condition.

Antimicrobial resistance is common and may be associated with poor outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to report longitudinal trends in mycobacterial isolation and NTM drug susceptibility. METHODS: Mycobacterial culture and drug sensitivity testing results were obtained over a 13 year period. Drug sensitivity testing was performed by broth macrodilution for slow-growing mycobacteria and disc diffusion for rapidly growing mycobacteria. RESULTS: Culture results were obtained from 109,311 samples (31,758 subjects) of which 5960 samples (1209 subjects) isolated NTM over 13 years. Drug susceptibility results were obtained for 2637 NTM isolates (898 subjects). NTM isolation increased over time, driven by the Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Amongst most species, resistance to the key agents clarithromycin and amikacin was rare. The highest rate of resistance was found in M. abscessus and Mycobacterium simiae. Most M. abscessus isolates were sensitive to macrolides, aminoglycosides and tigecycline; M. simiae isolates were only consistently sensitive to clofazimine, amikacin and cycloserine. CONCLUSIONS: NTM isolation is increasingly common in our centre. Reassuringly, resistance to clarithromycin and amikacin is rare in most species. Tigecycline, cycloserine and clofazimine may be useful in the treatment of the most resistant species, M. abscessus and M. simiae."

We selected 13 pathogens or syndromes implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks or other well-documented waterborne transmission (acute otitis externa, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), free-living ameba, Giardia, Hepatitis A virus, Legionella (Legionnaires' disease), nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Pseudomonas-related pneumonia or septicemia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio). We documented annual numbers of deaths in the United States associated with these infections using a combination of death certificate data, nationally representative hospital discharge data, and disease-specific surveillance systems (2003-2009). We documented 6,939 annual total deaths associated with the 13 infections; of these, 493 (7%) were caused by seven pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A total of 6,301 deaths (91%) were associated with infections from Pseudomonas, NTM, and Legionella, environmental pathogens that grow in water system biofilms. Biofilm-associated pathogens can cause illness following inhalation of aerosols or contact with contaminated water.

However, little is known about the diagnostic indications for true M. fortuitum pulmonary infection and the natural history of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment against M. fortuitum pulmonary infection. Fifteen years before the referral, he underwent total gastrectomy, after which he experienced esophageal reflux symptoms. After the referral, the patient was closely monitored without antimicrobial therapy because of mild symptoms and no pathological evidence of M. fortuitum pulmonary infection. During the observation, chest imaging showed migratory infiltrates. Two years after the referral, his lung biopsy specimen revealed foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, indicating lipoid pneumonia. However, he was continually monitored without any treatment because there was no evidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Four years after the referral, he developed refractory pneumonia despite receiving adequate antibiotic therapy. After confirmation of granulomatous lesions, multiple antimicrobial therapy for M. fortuitum resulted in a remarkable improvement with no exacerbation for over 5 years. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed identical M. fortuitum strains in seven isolates from six sputum and one intestinal fluid specimens obtained during the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a patient with M. fortuitum pulmonary infection who presented with migratory infiltrates. The pathological evidence and microbiological analysis suggested that M. fortuitum pulmonary infection was associated with lipoid pneumonia and chronic exposure to gastrointestinal fluid. Therefore, physicians should carefully monitor patients with M. fortuitum detected from lower respiratory tract specimens and consider antimicrobial therapy for M. fortuitum infection when the patient does not respond to adequate antibiotic therapy against common pneumonia pathogens."

We, therefore, carried out the retrospective study at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan to comprehensively investigate the prevalence of OIs, predictors of OIs, and risk factors for in-hospital death among HIV-infected patients. Sichuan in West China is characterized by the largest population living with HIV/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) across China. In total, we reviewed 954 cases of HIV infection, admitted to the hospital during January 2014 to December 2015, and found that bacterial pneumonia (25.8%) was the most common OIs, followed by candida infection (18.3%), Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (11.9%), tuberculosis (11.5%), infectious diarrhoea (9.3%), cryptococcus infection (7.3%), cytomegalovirus infection (4.9%), toxoplasmosis (4.6%), hepatitis C (4.0%), nontuberculous mycobacteria desease (2.2%) and Penicillium marneffei infection (0.3%).

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium terraeID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium terraeID:29764749TITLE:Prognosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease (PNTM) is a known risk factor for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). However, few studies have focused on the prognosis of PNTM-associated CPA. In the present investigation, we aimed to elucidate the clinical course and prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records of 62 patients with CPA and a history of PNTM who were admitted to Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center between 2010 and 2015. Co-morbidities, causative microorganisms, radiological findings, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 69.5 years, and the median follow-up period was 4.2 years. The major underlying diseases, other than PNTM and CPA, were old pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia. The most common causative NTM species were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC; 37 patients; 59.7%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (20 patients; 32.3%). Survival was 83% after 1 year and 61% after 5 years. Use of systemic corticosteroids (hazard ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-9.51; P=0.00177) and C-reactive protein levels &gt;= 5.0 mg/dL (hazard ratio: 8.96, 95% confidence interval: 2.15-62.9; P=0.0014) at the time of CPA diagnosis were associated with increased over-all mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CPA frequently developed in patients with MAC and M. kansasii PNTM. The treatment course of PNTM was not associated with all-cause mortality. However, systemic corticosteroid use and high CRP levels were negative prognostic factors of CPA in patients with PNTM. Since the prognosis is poor, early diagnosis and treatment of CPA are important in patients with PNTM."

The mycobacteria not included in MTBC are known as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and cause several pulmonary diseases including pneumonia. Currently, NTM occurrences in TB-suspected respiratory specimens have increased, due to which, precise detection of MTBC and NTM is considered critical for the diagnosis and vaccination of TB. Among the various methods available, real-time PCR is frequently adopted for MTBC/NTM detection due to its rapidness, accuracy, and ease of handling. In this study, we evaluated a new real-time PCR kit for analytical and clinical performance on sputum, bronchial washing, and culture specimens. Materials and Methods: For assessing its analytical performance, limit of detection (LOD), reactivity, and repeatability test were performed using DNA samples. To evaluate clinical performance, 612 samples were collected and clinically tested at a tertiary hospital. Results: LOD was confirmed as 0.584 copies/microL for MTBC and 47.836 copies/microL for NTM by probit analysis (95% positive). For the reactivity test, all intended strains were detected and, in the repeatability test, stable and steady results were confirmed with coefficient of variation ranging from 0.36 to 1.59. For the clinical test, sensitivity and specificity were 98.6%-100% and 98.8%-100% for MTBC and NTM, respectively. Conclusion: The results proved the usefulness of the kit in TB diagnosis. Furthermore, it could be adopted for the assessment of vaccine efficacy."

OBJECTIVE: To show the outcomes of pulmonary resection and identify risk factors after adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD. METHODS: One hundred and eight patients underwent adjuvant lung resection for MAC-LD at two hospitals between January 2008 and July 2016. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes and risk factors. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (13%). After lung resection, 98 out of 108 patients (91%) achieved sputum culture conversion, eight (8.2%) of whom developed microbiological recurrence during the follow-up period. As a result, the success rate of adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD with drug resistance was 83%. A multivariable analysis showed that a longer period from the initial medical treatment to surgery (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.02; p = 0.008) was independently associated with an increased risk of unfavorable outcomes after adjuvant surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant surgical treatments for MAC-LD have acceptable outcomes. Better control of the disease may be achieved in some patients with drug resistance and indications for surgery through surgical treatments, and pulmonary resection needs to be performed earlier rather than continuing chemotherapy in these patients because it reduces unfavorable outcomes."

Mycobacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but in most cystic fibrosis centers it is performed less frequently than culture for other pathogens. Consensus today recommends just one annual mycobacterial culture for asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, a strategy likely to lead to diagnostic delays. Postponement of diagnosis might be the deciding factor in whether an early colonization turns into chronic infection. This review highlights the latest developments in knowledge about the pathogenicity and clinical consequences of M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease, addressing the central theme of why pulmonary infection requires early identification and aggressive antibiotic treatment. The window of opportunity, before M. abscessus complex transforms from a mucosal colonizer to a chronic biofilm infection, is where microbial eradication is most likely to be successful, making early diagnosis essential for improved outcomes."

Current guideline therapeutic regimens involving an intensive phase of intravenous (IV) antibiotics followed by a consolidation phase of inhaled and oral antibiotics are not evidence-based. The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical outcomes and clearance of Mycobacterium abscessus complex (M. abscessus) from respiratory cultures in children with CF M. abscessus PD. METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis evaluated the first course of treatment for M. abscessus PD in 33 children in Queensland, Australia between 2001 and 2015. Spirometry and nutritional outcomes 2 years pretreatment and 1 year posttreatment were compared with clearance or relapse/persistence of Mycobacterium abscessus complex from respiratory cultures. RESULTS: Nine of 18 children who completed therapy, cleared infection. Three of 7 children who completed only intensive therapy cleared sputum compared with 0/8 children who did not. The trajectory of the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s and age standardized body mass index significantly improved posttreatment in those that cleared sputum (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that current treatment recommendations for M. abscessus PD are associated with some success in clearing infection in children with CF and improvement in lung function and body mass index. Clinical trials are required to determine the best treatment approaches."

The incidence of these tumors is increasing, but disease awareness remains low among clinicians. The synchronous presentation of lung cancer and mycobacterial infection is well known but the combination of pulmonary carcinoid and mycobacterial infection is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a 45-year-old female who presented with recurrent pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed a consolidation in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with various courses of antibiotics without full recovery after six months. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a central mass in the left upper lobe. Bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial, well-defined lesion that totally obstructed the left upper lobe bronchus. Bronchial biopsy showed typical carcinoid tumor. Rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery was attempted, but we were unable to radically remove the tumor. Therefore lobectomy was performed. The surgical pathology specimen showed atypical bronchial carcinoid and consolidations in the lung parenchyma with granulomatous inflammation distally of the bronchial obstruction. Ziehl-Neelsen staining demonstrated acid fast bacilli indicative of mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case history illustrates the importance of careful surgical pathologic examination, not only of the resected tumor, but also of the postobstructive lung parenchyma. Specific postobstructive infections such as tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can have clinical implications."

Case presentation: In this case report we describe a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 6-week history of non-productive cough, pleuritic chest pain and weight loss. She had a history of gastric adenocarcinoma managed with a distal oesophagectomy and total gastrectomy and consequentially suffered severe post-operative gastric reflux. Initial cultures were negative but following a VATS lung biopsy Mycobacterium goodii was cultured and histology revealed an organising pneumonia. Treatment was with a prolonged course of steroids, amikacin and meropenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. Ongoing gastric dysmotility and weight loss showed clinical improvement with a novel approach of a combination of prokinetics and somatostatin analogues controlling risk of repeat aspiration and improving symptom control. Conclusions: This is an unusual case of organising pneumonia related to Mycobacterium goodii infection and highlights the importance of mycobacterial culture in unusual and unresolving cases of organising pneumonia. The importance of controlling symptoms related to gastric dysmotility and aspiration is also addressed."

METHODS: Minocycline MICs for 55 MAC clinical isolates from the Netherlands were determined. We also co-incubated primary isolated macrophages infected with MAC with minocycline. Next, we performed a 28 day HFS-MAC model dose-response study in which we mimicked pulmonary concentration-time profiles achieved in patients. The HFS-MAC model was sampled at intervals to determine the minocycline pharmacokinetics and MAC burden. We identified the AUC0-24/MIC ratios associated with 1.0 log10 cfu/mL kill below day 0 (stasis), defined as a bactericidal effect. We then performed 10000 Monte Carlo experiments to identify the optimal dose for a bactericidal effect in patients. RESULTS: The MIC for 50% and 90% of cumulative clinical isolates was 8 and 64 mg/L, respectively. Minocycline decreased MAC bacterial burden below stasis in primary isolated macrophages. In the HFS-MAC model, minocycline achieved a microbial kill of 3.6 log10 cfu/mL below stasis. The AUC0-24/MIC exposure associated with a bactericidal effect was 59. Monte Carlo experiments identified a minocycline susceptibility MIC breakpoint of 16 mg/L. At this proposed breakpoint, the clinical dose of 200 mg/day achieved the bactericidal effect exposure target in ~50% of patients, while 400 mg/day achieved this in 73.6% of patients, in Monte Carlo experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline at a dose of 400 mg/day is expected to be bactericidal. We propose a clinical trial for validation."

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

Bronchiectasis is an irreversible complication of ABPA. The key to early diagnosis is to consider ABPA in anyone with asthma or cystic fibrosis and with a positive skin test result for Aspergillus, and/or recurrent infiltrates on radiographs. The differential diagnosis for ABPA in patients with asthma includes diseases in which there is an overlap of asthma, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and radiographic infiltrates. Examples include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, drug-induced pulmonary infiltrates, infection with a parasite, asthma with atelectasis, and lymphoma. Mucus plugging that causes a ""tree in bud"" pattern on computerized tomography examination of the lungs may be from ABPA or other conditions, such as nontuberculous (atypical) mycobacteria (Mycobacteria avium-Mycobacteria intracellulare complex). Prednisone is indicated to clear pulmonary infiltrates, and a usual course is for 3 months. Itraconazole and voriconazole are adjunctive, and drug-drug interactions must be considered because azoles decrease elimination of various medications. Although not familial in most patients, presentation of Aspergillus fumigatus f1 (Asp f1) antigen is restricted to specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR2 (HLA-DR2), and HLA-DR5. There is an increased number of CD4+ T-helper type 2 lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage, and A. fumigatus can serve as a growth factor of eosinophils potentiating the effects of interleukin (IL) 3, IL-5, and Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Eosinophils interact directly with A. fumigatus spores and generate extracellular traps, which can injure the bronchial epithelium."

Several studies have linked IgG4-RD to infections such as tuberculosis and actinomycosis. However, the coexistence of IgG4-RD and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) in a single pulmonary nodule has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old male patient presented with cough and sputum. A solitary pulmonary nodule suspicious of lung cancer was found on chest CT. DIAGNOSIS: Through video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy, a diagnosis of co-existing NTM and IgG4-RD in a single nodule was made. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was applied for pneumonia developed after surgery. The patient was also supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation since his pneumonia was refractory to medical treatment. OUTCOMES: The patient expired on the 60th postoperative day due to multiple organ failure. LESSONS: IgG4-RD can occur singularly or accompanied by other diseases. We report a solitary pulmonary nodule caused by NTM and concurrent IgG4-RD, suggesting a possible association between these 2 entities. Immunologic relations between IgG4-RD and accompanying infection should be further investigated."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium terraeID:32102768TITLE:Comparison of the chest computed tomography findings between patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and those with Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Since the computed tomography (CT) findings of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease are similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), we often have difficulty differentiating the two. In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

Given the limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of NTM treatment, this study aimed to evaluate the same among elderly patients. Material and methods: Patients diagnosed with NTM disease at a tertiary hospital from January 2007 to December 2017 were enrolled and data were then retrospectively collected. Data of elderly patients who received antimycobacterial treatment were then analyzed. Results: A total of 161 patients satisfied the diagnostic criteria for NTM disease. There were 40 elderly patients who received treatments. Of the patients, 60% received the guideline oriented standard regimens. Single drug regimens were administered to 22.5% of patients. Only 55.0% of the patients were able to continue any treatment. Treatment-related discontinuation was observed in 44.4% of discontinued or changed patients. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of patients with or without adverse events. Patients who were able to continue the treatment for >12 months had a lower proportion of activities of daily living (ADL) disability (nine in 18, 50.0% vs. three in 22, 13.6%, p = 0.018) and heart disease (six in 18, 33.3% vs. 1/22, 4.6%, p = 0.033). Sputum culture conversion was achieved in 28 out of 40 (70.0%) elderly patients treated, and those who achieved sputum culture conversion had more standard regimens prescribed than those who failed sputum culture conversion (21 in 28, 75% vs. 3 in 12, 25%; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Age may not be an obstacle for receiving the benefits of the treatment of NTM disease with a precise evaluation of patient's comorbidities. Furthermore, elderly patients without heart disease and ADL disability may have better rate of continuing the NTM treatment. The current study suggested that selecting standard regimens to treat pulmonary NTM is important for elderly patients."

However, a large-scale epidemiological study on this issue in Korea is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of NTM infection after lung transplant surgery in Korea. METHODS: Between October 2012 and December 2018, we retrospectively evaluated lung transplant recipients in a referral hospital in South Korea. A total of 215 recipients were enrolled. The median age at transplantation was 56 years (range, 17-75), and 62% were men. Bronchoscopy was performed according to the surveillance protocol and clinical indications. A diagnosis of NTM infection was defined as a positive NTM culture from a bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample, or two separate sputum samples. We determined NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) according to the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America 2007 guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for conditional survival analysis in patients with follow-up of >=12 months. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (6.5%) were diagnosed with NTM infection at a median of 11.8 months (range, 0.3-51.4) after transplantation. Nine patients (4.2%) were diagnosed with NTM-PD, and the incidence rate was 1980/100,000 person-years. Mycobacterium abscessus was the most common species causing NTM-PD (66%), followed by M. avium complex (33%). The presence of NTM infection did not influence all-cause mortality among those who underwent follow-up for >=12 months (N = 133, log-rank P = 0.816). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NTM-PD was considerably high among lung-transplant recipients. M. abscessus was the most common causative species of NTM-PD after lung transplantation."

It has in vitro activity against nontuberculous mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus complex, but clinical data for this indication are lacking. Methods: Omadacycline use was reviewed at an 804-bed academic medical center. Patients were included if they received omadacycline for culture-proven M abscessus disease in 2019. Results: Four patients received omadacycline for the treatment of culture-positive M abscessus disease in 2019. Two patients had cutaneous disease, 1 had pulmonary disease, and 1 had osteomyelitis and bacteremia. The patients received omadacycline for a median duration of 166 days (range, 104-227) along with a combination of other antimicrobial agents. Omadacycline-containing regimens were associated with a clinical cure in 3 of 4 patients, with 1 patient improving on ongoing treatment. Omadacycline's tolerability was acceptable for patients with M abscessus disease, with 1 patient discontinuing therapy in month 6 due to nausea. Conclusions: Omadacycline is a novel oral option for the treatment of M abscessus disease, for which safe and effective options are needed. Although this case series is promising, further data are required to determine omadacycline's definitive role in the treatment of M abscessus disease."

Most cases occur during lactation and are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species; parasites and Mycobacteria have rarely been reported to cause breast infections (Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases (9th edn);2019, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007;175:367). Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) which are also referred to as atypical mycobacteria, mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT), or environmental mycobacteria are a large group of Mycobacteria which are becoming increasingly common cause of infection all over the world (Arch Dermatol. 2006;142:1287). NTM can cause infection diseases especially in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-positive hosts, most commonly in the lungs, skin and soft tissue, lymph nodes or rarely spread with multiorgan dissemination (Arch Plast Surg. 2014;41:759). Mycobacterium gordonae (M. gordonae) is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium that is considered the least pathogenic NTM. The organism is ubiquitous, and mostly isolated from soil and water. Despite its nonvirulent nature, clinically significant infections have been reported also in some immunocompetent patients (J Formosan Med Assoc. 2020, Clin Infect Dis. 1992;1229). We report the first documented case of breast infection in a young immunocompetent woman sustained by Mycobacterium Gordonae."

Methods: From January 2014 to December 2018, there were 1 006 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Chest Hospital for the first time and received examination by bronchoscopy. A total of 89 patients with complete data were selected, including 40 males and 49 females, aged 20 to 85 years, with 46 patients (52%) aged 60 years or older. The clinical symptoms and signs of the patients were analyzed with chest imaging, bronchoscopy and pathological examination results. Comparisons between groups were made by Chi-square test and t test. Results: The number of patients with NTM complicated with tracheobronchial lesions accounted for 8.9%(89/1 006) of those hospitalized with NTM and received bronchoscopy during the same period. Clinical symptoms included cough and sputum (89/89), different degrees of hemoptysis or blood sputum (52/89), and shortness of breath (50/89). Chest CT showed that 72 cases (72/89, 81%) had lung lesions involving more than 3 lung fields, and 83 cases (93%) had bronchiectasis and 63 cases (63/89, 71%) with cavities. Pulmonary atelectasis was shown in 45 cases (45/89, 51%). By bronchoscopy, 39 cases (39/89, 44%) were diagnosed as tuberculous lesions involving bilateral upper bronchi, while lesions of the right lower bronchus was found in 27 cases (27/89, 30%).The percentage of patients with multilobar bronchial involvement was 50.6%(45/89). The morphological characteristics of the bronchial lesions included scar stenosis or atresia in 63 cases (63/89, 71%), hyperemia and edema in 46 cases (46/89, 52%), and multiple types of lesions in 48 cases (48/89, 54%). Conclusions: Patients with NTM lung disease complicated with tracheobronchial inflammatory lesions did not have specific manifestations clinically. Lung lesions are extensive, often accompanied by bronchiectasis and cavity formation. Endoscopic changes were mostly manifested as multilobar tracheobronchial involvement characterized by scar stenosis, congestion and edema, mainly involving bilateral upper bronchi and the right lower bronchus."

However, studies about extrapulmonary NTM infections have been limited. Therefore, we aim to describe the diversity of extrapulmonary NTM infections and identify predictors for species. Information regarding diversity of NTM isolates, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, treatment regimens, and outcomes were collected from four tertiary care centers in South Korea. Comparisons were made between patients with rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) and slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM) infections. A total of 117 patients (46 males vs. 71 females) were included. Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) predominated (34.2%), followed by bone and joint infections (28.2%).

It is susceptible to multiple antibiotics both in vitro and in clinical practice, so that any combination of susceptible drugs is effective. However, we encountered a case of infection due to fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum. In this study, we report the case and describe the mechanism of resistance. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man with a history of total gastrectomy and immunosuppressant treatment for rheumatoid arthritis developed a recurrence of pulmonary infection caused by M. fortuitum. He was treated with clarithromycin and levofloxacin as a first-line treatment, based on the favorable susceptibility at that time. After recurrence, a high minimum inhibitory concentration to fluoroquinolones was detected. DNA sequencing of the pathogen showed the substitution of serine for tryptophan at residue 83 in the gyrA gene. He was successfully treated with a combination of other antibiotics. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant M. fortuitum and investigation of the mechanism of resistance. We suggest that the susceptibility test remains effective for determining the next line of treatment after a pathogen has acquired resistance, and resistance to fluoroquinolones in M. fortuitum can be attributed to a single change of amino acid."

NTM lung disease has been identified as a predictor of mortality in CPA patients. The major risk factors for NTM-associated CPA include fibrocavitary NTM lung disease, the presence of pulmonary emphysema, and high-dose corticosteroid use. The onset of CPA is 1.5-7 years following the diagnosis of NTM lung disease. The diagnosis can be made using standard criteria; however, serological diagnosis using Aspergillus precipitin has demonstrated a higher sensitivity and specificity when compared with fungal culture from respiratory specimens. Treatment is challenging since rifampicin and oral triazoles should not be used concomitantly.

As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case of S. apiospermum lung disease in a patient with NTM but without tuberculosis. The possibility of S. apiospermum infection should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary mycetoma.

Of these, 12 were reports of pseudo-outbreaks, i.e., the nosocomial transmission of organism from hospital ice/ice machines to patients, resulting in patient colonization, but with no disease manifestations. In addition, there were five outbreaks that resulted in clinical disease/pathology associated with NTM organism. Eleven different species of NTMs have been associated with these reports, where over half (59%) of the species identified were Mycobacterium fortuitum (18%), Mycobacterium gordonae (14%), Mycobacterium mucogenicum (14%), and Mycobacterium porcinum (14%). Several of these reports clearly documented that ice machines had been properly maintained, cleaned, and serviced in accordance with the CDC guidelines yet became contaminated with NTM organisms. These reports frequently detail that after extensive cleaning/disinfection following the discovery of NTM organisms, ice machines remained contaminated with NTM organisms, highlighting the difficulty in eradicating these from ice machines, once contaminated. Several reports identified that the only remedy to the contamination problem was to replace the ice machine with a new machine. Two qualitative risk assessment models are presented for (i) patients exposed to contaminated ice machine but before NTM colonization/infection and (ii) patients already colonized with NTMs from ice machines. Therefore, to protect immunocompromised/immunosuppressed patients' safety, especially during surgical or respiratory procedures, ice should not be sourced from the ice machine but should be made from sterile water and stored safely and separately away from the ice machine."

Although numerous studies have investigated the genetic variation among prevalent clinical NTM species, including Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium, many of the less common but clinically relevant NTM species, including M. kubicae, still lack complete genomes to serve as a comparative reference. Well-characterized representative genomes for each NTM species are important both for investigating the pathogenic potential of NTM, as well as for use in diagnostic methods, even for species that less frequently cause human disease. Here, we report the complete genomes of two M. kubicae strains, isolated from two unrelated patients. Hybrid short-read and long-read sequencing and assembly, using sequence reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms, were utilized to resolve the chromosome and plasmid sequences of each isolate. The genome of NJH_MKUB1 had 5135 coding sequences (CDSs), a circular chromosome of length 5.3 Mb and two plasmids. The genome of NJH_MKUB2 had 5957 CDSs, a circular chromosome of 6.0 Mb and five plasmids. We compared our completed genomic assemblies to four recently released draft genomes of M. kubicae in order to better understand intraspecies genomic conservation and variability. We also identified genes implicated in drug resistance, virulence and persistence in the M. kubicae chromosome and plasmids. Virulence factors encoded in the genome and in the plasmids of M. kubicae provide a foundation for investigating how opportunistic environmental NTM may cause disease."

This analysis was restricted to patients residing in single family homes with a valid residential street address and conducted at the census block level (n = 13,495 blocks). Negative binomial regression models with thin-plate spline smoothing function of geographic coordinates were applied to assess effects of census block-level environmental characteristics on pulmonary NTM isolation count. Patients (n = 507) resided in 473 (3.4%) blocks within the study area. Blocks with >20% hydric soils had 26.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8%, 58.0%), p = 0.03, higher adjusted mean patient counts compared to blocks with <=20% hydric soil, while blocks with >50% acidic soil had 24.8% (-2.4%, 59.6%), p = 0.08 greater mean patient count compared to blocks with <=50% acidic soil. Isolation rates varied by county after adjusting for covariates. The effects of using disinfected public water supplies vs. private wells, and of various measures of urbanicity were not significantly associated with NTM. Our results suggest that proximity to certain soil types (hydric and acidic) could be a risk factor for pulmonary NTM isolation in central North Carolina."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium terraeID:33404128TITLE:Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease in children.ABSTRACT:Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms in our surrounding environment. Four distinct clinical syndromes associated with NTM infection have been described: skin and soft tissue disease, lymphadenitis, disseminated disease and pulmonary disease. In children, lymphadenitis is the most common NTM clinical entity, particularly affecting those aged 1-5 years who have no known risk factors for disease. Optimal management of NTM lymphadenitis is not entirely clear, although surgical intervention is likely a definitive therapy. Disseminated NTM disease is uncommon and only seen in the setting of immunocompromise. In previously well children, this presentation should always lead to consideration of an underlying immune defect, such as Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. Identification of the underlying cause enables more targeted therapy and better prognostic understanding. Pulmonary NTM disease is fundamentally different to the other clinical syndromes, presenting in different hosts, who have different comorbidities, and follow a different clinical course."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium tuberculosisID:27960204TITLE:Community-acquired Pneumonia: A Global Perspective.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a global disease responsible for a large proportion of deaths and having significant economic cost. As diagnostic tools have increased in sensitivity, our understanding of the etiology of CAP has begun to change with a significant increase in confirmed viral infections and the recognition that multiple pathogens are frequently present. Empiric therapy remains the standard of care and guidelines are mostly based on published data from the United States or Europe. Blindly applying guidelines without any consideration of local etiological differences can lead to a risk of under or overtreatment. Several pathogens are particularly problematic in the setting of CAP in some regions as they are not covered by standard guidelines; in particular, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Acinetobacter baumanii. Overtreatment of patients meeting guideline criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia is also a problem as this categorization probably only applies to a limited number of areas in the United States. New pathogens are emerging more frequently, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza A H1N1 09, and avian influenza, all of which have global ramifications and good clinicians need to stay informed of evolving threats. There are clearly differences in outcomes from CAP across the globe, but accurately comparing them is difficult given the vast differences in age, comorbidities, and access to healthcare. Improved quality of outcome databases will be a key driver of quality improvement in coming years."

OBJECTIVE: To show the most common detected bacteria in bacterial culture of sputum in patients with CAP hospitalized in Clinic for Pulmonary Diseases and TB ""Podhrastovi"" in four-year period: from 2012 to 2015. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is the retrospective analysis. Each patient gave sputum 3 days in a row when admitted to hospital. Sputum has been examined: bacterial culture with antibiotics sensitivity, Gram stain, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; in cases with high temperature blood cultures were done; when we were suspicious about bronchial carcinoma bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) was done. We show analyzed patients according to age, sex, whether they had pneumonia or bronchopneumonia, bacteria isolated in sputum and in BAL. RESULTS: 360 patients with CAP were treated in four-year period (247 males and 113 females). 167 or 43, 39 % had pneumonia (119 males and 48 females). Number of males was significantly bigger (chi2 = 30,186; p&lt;0,001). 193 or 53, 61 % had bronchopneumonia (128 males and 65 females). Number of males was significantly bigger (chi2 = 20,556; p&lt;0,001). Number of patients with negative bacterial culture of sputum (131-78, 44%) was significantly bigger than number of patients with positive culture (36-21, 56%) (chi2 = 50,042; p&lt;0,001) in pneumonia. Number of patients with negative bacterial culture of sputum (154- 79, 79%) was significantly bigger than number of patients with positive culture (39- 20, 21%) (chi2 = 68,523; p&lt;0,001) in bronchopneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae was significantly most common detected bacterium compared with the number of other isolated bacteria; in pneumonia (chi2 =33,222; p&lt;0,001) and in bronchopneumonia (chi2 =51,231; p&lt;0,001). CONCLUSION: It is very important to detect the bacterial cause of CAP to administrate the targeted antibiotic therapy."

The objective of this study is to determine prospectively the etiology of community-acquired pulmonary infections in hospitalized adults living with HIV. Patients were submitted to an extended microbiological investigation that included molecular methods. The microbiological findings were evaluated according to severity of the disease and pneumococcal vaccine status. Two hundred twenty-four patients underwent the extended microbiological investigation of whom 143 (64%) had an etiology determined. Among the 143 patients with a determined etiology, Pneumocystis jirovecii was the main agent, detected in 52 (36%) cases and followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis accounting for 28 (20%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Rhinovirus were diagnosed in 22 (15%) cases each and influenza in 15 (10%) cases. Among atypical bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was responsible for 12 (8%) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae for 7 (5%) cases. Mixed infections occurred in 48 cases (34%). S pneumoniae was associated with higher severity scores and not associated with vaccine status. By using extended diagnostics, a microbiological agent could be determined in the majority of patients living with HIV affected by community-acquired pulmonary infections. Our findings can guide clinicians in the choice of empirical therapy for hospitalized pulmonary disease."

However, the treatment protocol is not similar. Mycobacterium simiae is a rare cause of NTM pulmonary infection. Herein, we aimed to evaluate and compare the computed tomography (CT) scan findings of M. simiae infection in lungs. For this reason, thirty-four patients (n = 34) with M. simiae lung infection were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnosis was confirmed by American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines and CT scans were reviewed in both lung and mediastinal windows. The average age of patients was 63 +- 14.54 years and 52.9% were male. The majority of patients had cough (91.2%) and sputum production (76.5%). Clinically, 41.2% of patients had previous history of TB (14/34), 38.2% had cardiac diseases (13/34), and 35.3% had diabetes mellitus (12/34). The most common CT findings in our study were nodular lesions (100%) and bronchiectasis (85.29%). Regarding the severity, grade I bronchiectasis was the most prevalent. Other prominent findings were tree-in-bud sign (88.2%), consolidation (52.94%), and lobar fibrosis and volume loss (67.6%). There was no significant zonal distribution of findings. In conclusion, nodular lesions and bronchiectasis are the most frequent features in CT scan of M. simiae pulmonary infection."

This study aimed to evaluate TB diagnostic and treatment delays in acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-negative patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. Patients with positive AFB culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) were selected from among hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Admission ward, anti-tuberculosis treatment and the duration of AFB culture were compared between smear-positive and smear-negative patients. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients with positive isolation of MTC in AFB culture, 27 (38.5%) were smear-negative; of these, 18 (66.7%) were not isolated while in hospital, and 17 (63%) were neither diagnosed nor treated for TB. In contrast, 41 of the 43 smear-positive patients (95.3%) were directly admitted or quickly transferred to the isolation room and started on anti-tuberculosis treatment (P &lt; 0.001). Samples from smear-negative patients required more time to grow MTC in AFB culture than those of smear-positive patients (23 days vs. 14 days, P &lt; 0.001). Diabetes was significantly associated with AFB smear positivity, with an odds ratio of 12.2. CONCLUSIONS: Negative AFB smears caused significant diagnostic and treatment delay.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old Thai man presented to our center with typical clinical manifestations of tuberculous lymphadenitis, with negative tests for both acid-fast bacilli and fungi, and negative polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterial tuberculosis complex. The disease was not responding to anti-tuberculosis treatment and he developed both pericardial effusion and progressive lymphadenopathy. Large lymphoma cells were evident in the pericardial effusion, and a review of the previous lymph node biopsies confirmed the existence of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma and tuberculous lymphadenitis. Moreover, when the tests were repeated, he was found to be positive for both acid-fast bacilli and Mycobacterial tuberculosis complex. The presence of typical morphology of tuberculous lymphadenitis and inattentional blindness may explain why the presence of large lymphoma cells was overlooked in one of the previous lymph node biopsies. Our patient developed severe pneumonia with profound septic shock due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and died within days. CONCLUSIONS: Given that tuberculosis and lymphoma can share common features, this case highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all foregoing relevant patient data (most notably pathology samples) in order to rule out the presence of lymphoma that may exist within the shadow of typical morphology of tuberculous lymphadenitis."

We hypothesized an association between pulmonary MAI infection and Th2-type immune responses as seen in allergy. METHODS: Biomarkers of patient Th2-type immune responses (peripheral blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE levels) were compared between patients with positive pulmonary samples for tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. A further comparison of clinical characteristics, including respiratory co-morbidities, and biomarkers, was conducted between patients culturing MAI NTM and those culturing NTM other than MAI. RESULTS: Patients culturing NTM from pulmonary samples had significantly higher peripheral blood eosinophil levels than those culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, patients culturing MAI compared to those culturing NTM other than MAI had higher eosinophil counts (mean 0.29x109/L vs 0.15x109/L, p = 0.010) and IgE levels (geometric mean 138kU/L vs 47kU/L, p = 0.021). However there was no significant difference in the frequency of asthma between the two NTM groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between biomarkers of Th2-type immune responses and pulmonary MAI. Prospective and translational research could identify the direction of causation; and so determine whether our finding may be utilized within future management strategies for MAI."

Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify associations between country of origin and risk of major OIs. In total, 1,505 patients were included: NMC, N = 365; LPH, N = 442; BMH, N = 384; and PGH, N = 314. The median age was 32 years, and 73.3% of all patients were male. The median CD4 count was 200 cells/muL. Most patients at NMC and PGH were men who have sex with men. Injection drug users were most common at BMH (35.7%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) was most common at PGH (N = 75) but was rare at NMC (N = 4). Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prevalence was highest at NMC (N = 74) and lowest at BMH (N = 13). Multivariable logistic regression showed increased odds of TB at PGH (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 42.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.6-122.1), BMH (aOR = 12.6, CI = 3.9-40.3), and LPH (aOR = 6.6, CI = 2.1-21.1) but decreased odds of PCP at BMH (aOR = 0.1, CI = 0.04-0.2) and LPH (aOR = 0.2, CI = 0.1-0.4) compared with those at NMC. The cryptococcosis risk was increased at LPH (aOR = 6.2, CI = 0.9-41.0) compared with that at NMC. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis prevalences were similar in all countries. OI prevalence remained high among ART-naive patients in our cohort. The risks of TB, PCP, and cryptococcosis, but not CMV retinitis, differed between countries.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic yield of open lung biopsy (OLB) in children with diffuse lung disease (DLD), comparing findings in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected children. DESIGN: This 9-year retrospective study included 51 children with DLD (oxygen-dependent or on artificial ventilation), who required an OLB where the diagnosis remained uncertain after extensive investigations. RESULTS: The median age was 7 months, median body weight was 6.6 kg (61% were severely malnourished) and 30% were HIV-infected (62% on antiretroviral treatment). The diagnostic yield of the OLB was 86% (n = 44) and was significantly higher in HIV-infected (77%) than in non-HIV-infected (48%) children (P = 0.01). Pneumonia was the most common diagnosis (n = 25, 57%), with common agents being cytomegalovirus (CMV), viruses other than CMV, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and previously undiagnosed TB (10%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a cause of DLD was not suspected before the OLB, as all investigations for TB were negative. Non-infectious causes of DLD were established in 10% of cases. CONCLUSION: The OLB is a useful diagnostic tool to diagnose idiopathic DLD, including TB, in young children."

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and radiological features of, and treatment regimens and outcomes in, children with NP. RESULTS: Of 32 children (median age 16.5 months, interquartile range 10-33), 8 (25%) (median age 49 months) had NP associated with M. tuberculosis, 6 of whom were HIV-infected. Chest computed tomography (CT) was diagnostic in all cases: no radiological signs were suggestive of TB. There was no difference in the clinical picture, chest radiography or CT scan between M. tuberculosis-associated and bacterial NP. M. tuberculosis was cultured in 75% of cases; pleural fluid acid-fast bacilli was positive in an additional two cases. Surgery was required in 46% of the M. tuberculosis cases. At follow-up, 50% of these cases had complete radiological resolution similar to bacterial NP. CONCLUSION: This series highlights the fact that M. tuberculosis not only causes acute pneumonia in children, it also results in numerous complications.

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium tuberculosisID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

Although TB pneumonia is one of the causes of disease and death among children worldwide, the literature on TB pneumonia-induced ARDS is limited. We report herein on the successful treatment of a two-year-old female child with TB pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). CASE PRESENTATION: A two-year-old Vietnamese female child with sustained fever and cough for 20 days was transferred to our hospital. She had severe dyspnea and a chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration without findings of heart failure. After tracheal intubation, her oxygenation index (OI) and PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio were 29 and 60 mmHg, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) assay of tracheal lavage fluid. She was diagnosed as having severe ARDS that developed from TB pneumonia. Anti-tuberculous therapy and cardiopulmonary support were started. However, her respiratory condition deteriorated despite treatment with high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFO), vasopressor support, and 1 g/kg of immunoglobulin. On the third day after admission, her International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC score had increased to 5. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) was administered to treat the DIC. After the administration of rTM was completed, OI gradually decreased, after which the mechanical ventilation mode was changed from HFO to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The DIC score also gradually decreased. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycan end products (sRAGE) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), which are reported to be associated with ARDS severity, also decreased. In addition, inflammatory biomarkers, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased after the administration of rTM. Although severe ARDS (P/F ratio   100 mmHg) continued for 19 days, the patient's OI and P/F ratio improved gradually, and she was extubated on the 27th day after admission. The severe ARDS with DIC was successfully treated, and she was discharged from hospital on day 33 post-admission.

However, the distribution of the etiology of CAP varies from one country to another, with limited data from rural areas. METHODS: A prospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Leyte, Central Philippines from May 2010 to May 2012. Blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal samples obtained from patients were used to identify pathogens using standard microbiological culture methods and PCR. RESULTS: Of the 535 patients enrolled, 38% were younger than 50 years old. More than half of the patients had an underlying disease, including pulmonary tuberculosis (22%). The detection rate was higher for bacteria (40%) than viruses (13%).

HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) most common. Bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 [1.19-5.01]).Conclusions: In the antiretroviral therapy era, CAP in Malawi remains predominantly HIV associated, with a large proportion attributable to potentially vaccine-preventable pathogens. Strategies to increase early detection and treatment of tuberculosis and improve supportive care, in particular the correction of hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address CAP-associated mortality."

In the present case, symptoms and chest infiltrative shadow initially improved by tosufloxacin. Therefore, we regarded this patient as having general pneumonia and did not perform follow-up chest X-ray until the infiltrates had completely disappeared. However, a few weeks later, the symptoms and the infiltrates had worsened, so M. tuberculosis was isolated from the patient's sputum. This case suggests that patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis should be monitored carefully, even if antibiotics without antituberculous activity are initially effective."

The incidence of these tumors is increasing, but disease awareness remains low among clinicians. The synchronous presentation of lung cancer and mycobacterial infection is well known but the combination of pulmonary carcinoid and mycobacterial infection is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a 45-year-old female who presented with recurrent pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed a consolidation in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with various courses of antibiotics without full recovery after six months. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a central mass in the left upper lobe. Bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial, well-defined lesion that totally obstructed the left upper lobe bronchus. Bronchial biopsy showed typical carcinoid tumor. Rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery was attempted, but we were unable to radically remove the tumor. Therefore lobectomy was performed. The surgical pathology specimen showed atypical bronchial carcinoid and consolidations in the lung parenchyma with granulomatous inflammation distally of the bronchial obstruction. Ziehl-Neelsen staining demonstrated acid fast bacilli indicative of mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case history illustrates the importance of careful surgical pathologic examination, not only of the resected tumor, but also of the postobstructive lung parenchyma. Specific postobstructive infections such as tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can have clinical implications."

We aimed to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of routine tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic work-up in lung clinics in Indonesia, a country with the third highest TB burden and the second highest gap between notifications of TB cases and the best estimate of incident cases in the world. METHODS: In the lung clinics of the Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, we recruited all consecutive patients with symptoms suggesting TB, aged &gt;=18 years. Routine TB examination consisted of clinical evaluation, sputum smear microscopy, and chest radiography. For research purposes, we added sputum culture, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing, and follow-up for 1.5 years or 2.5 years if culture results disagreed with the initial clinical diagnosis. The initial diagnosis was considered incorrect if patients did not respond to treatment. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the TB routine examination using culture and a composite reference standard (CRS - a combination of routine examination, culture, and follow-up) as the reference standards. All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, we included 360 participants, and 21 were excluded due to incomplete data. Among those analyzed, 115 were initially diagnosed with smear-positive TB, 12 with smear-negative TB, and 212 non-TB. In 15 study participants, the diagnosis was changed after median 45 (range: 14-870) days; 14 participants initially not diagnosed with TB were later diagnosed with TB, while one subject initially diagnosed with TB actually did not have TB. Compared with culture and CRS, TB routine examination had sensitivity of 85% (95%CI: 77-91) and 90% (95%CI: 84-94), and specificity of 86.3% (95%CI: 81-91) and 99.5% (95%CI: 97-100), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of clinical evaluation with sputum microscopy and chest radiography provided high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing TB in lung clinics; in only 4.4% the diagnosis was incorrect. There is a need to improve routine TB diagnostic work by using clinical evaluation, sputum smear microscopy, and chest radiography all together in other settings, such as in primary health centers.

In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1-59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41 8% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99 7% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31 7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10 6-97 3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6 4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3 2%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33 9%] of 56). Almost all cases (98 9%) and controls (98 0%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61 4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 57 3-65 6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27 3% (23 3-31 6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5 9% (3 9-8 3). Viruses were less common (54 5%, 95% CrI 47 4-61 5 vs 68 0%, 62 7-72 7) and bacteria more common (33 7%, 27 2-40 8 vs 22 8%, 18 3-27 6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31 1%, 95% CrI 28 4-34 2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus-enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes. FUNDING: Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation."

We reviewed 20 cases of congenital TB reported between 2011 and 2017 and report a case of a mother and her 8 days old neonate with congenital TB. In these 21 cases (including our case), the most common clinical presentations were respiratory distress, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly. The most common chest imaging findings were pneumonia, multiple pulmonary nodules, and miliary pattern. The mortality rate of infants with TB was increased ~2.2-fold if their mothers had no symptoms. The case reported herein concerns an 8 days old neonate with the rare presentation of a 2 days history of fever, followed by abdominal distension without respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) imaging exhibited a large amount of right pleural effusion. Multiple antimicrobial therapies were administered to the neonate; however, his symptoms persisted. Repeat CT was used to identify a progressed disease with multiple nodules over the lung, spleen, and hepatic hilar region. Standard anti-TB medications were prescribed, and the patient recovered gradually. Both gastric lavage and pleural effusion cultures confirmed the diagnosis of TB. The neonate's mother denied any TB contact history and the diagnosis of any medical disease during pregnancy, but she experienced a fulminant course of miliary TB and was admitted to the intensive care unit 24 days postpartum. She died despite receiving anti-TB treatment. In TB-endemic areas, congenital TB should be taken into consideration when neonates develop fever, respond poorly to antimicrobial treatment, and when their mothers deny any TB contact history."

DESIGN: Review of published English literature between 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include young age, malnutrition, immunosuppression, tobacco smoke or air pollution exposure. Better methods for specimen collection and molecular diagnostics have improved microbiological diagnosis, indicating that pneumonia results from several organisms interacting. Induced sputum increases microbiologic yield for Bordetella pertussis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has been associated with pneumonia in high TB prevalence areas. The proportion of cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b has declined with new conjugate vaccines; Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae non-type b are the commonest bacterial pathogens; viruses are the most common pathogens. Effective interventions comprise antibiotics, oxygen and non-invasive ventilation. New vaccines have reduced severity and incidence of disease, but disparities exist in uptake. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia has decreased but a considerable preventable burden remains. Widespread implementation of available, effective interventions and development of novel strategies are needed."

Hospitalised children are low-hanging fruit for TB case detection as they are within the system. We aimed to explore the process of recognition and investigation for childhood TB using a guideline-linked cascade of care. METHODS: This was an observational study of 42,107 children admitted to 13 county hospitals in Kenya from 01Nov 15-31Oct 16, and 01Nov 17-31Oct 18. We estimated those that met each step of the cascade, those with an apparent (or ""Working"") TB diagnosis and modelled associations with TB tests amongst guideline-eligible children. RESULTS: 23,741/42,107 (56.4%) met step 1 of the cascade (&gt;=2 signs and symptoms suggestive of TB). Step 2(further screening of history of TB contact/full respiratory exam) was documented in 14,873/23,741 (62.6%) who met Step 1. Step 3(chest x-ray or Mantoux test) was requested in 2,451/14,873 (16.5%) who met Step 2. Step 4(&gt;=1 bacteriological test) was requested in 392/2,451 (15.9%) who met Step 3. Step 5(""Working TB"" diagnosis) was documented in 175/392 (44.6%) who met Step 4. Factors associated with request of TB tests in patients who met Step 1 included: i) older children [AOR 1.19(CI 1.09-1.31)]; ii) co-morbidities of HIV, malnutrition or pneumonia [AOR 3.81(CI 3.05-4.75), 2.98(CI 2.69-3.31) and 2.98(CI 2.60-3.40) respectively]; iii) sicker children, readmitted/referred [AOR 1.24(CI 1.08-1.42) and 1.15(CI 1.04-1.28) respectively]. ""Working TB"" diagnosis was made in 2.9%(1,202/42,107) of all admissions and 0.2%(89/42,107) were bacteriologically-confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of all paediatric admissions had symptoms associated with TB and nearly two-thirds had more specific history documented. Only a few amongst them got TB tests requested. TB was diagnosed in 2.9% of all admissions but most were inadequately investigated. Major challenges remain in identifying and investigating TB in children in hospitals with access to Xpert MTB/RIF and a review is needed of existing guidelines."

In the United States, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently identified bacterial pathogen responsible for CAP. Other etiologic pathogens of CAP vary based on the geographic region. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an uncommon cause of CAP in the United States, while it is a principal cause in many African and Asian countries. Coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rare and has only been reported in the setting of underlying HIV infection in areas of high tuberculosis prevalence. Here, we report a case of CAP in the absence of HIV, where Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified on admission and delay in diagnosis of concomitant active pulmonary tuberculosis led to inappropriate isolation. In addition to a high index of suspicion, epidemiologic and radiographic findings can be helpful to recognize tuberculosis as a cause of CAP even when other pathogens have already been identified."

Eosinophilic COPD has more exacerbations but responds well to corticosteroids and bronchodilators. We hereby report the case of a patient who came to us with shortness of breath, fever, wheezing and a cough with yellow phlegm. He had a history of smoking 4.5 pack-year and two episodes of pulmonary tuberculosis (the second was pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis). He was diagnosed with eosinophilic COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. Intravenous corticosteroids, bronchodilators and antibiotics were given and his condition improved after a week of hospitalisation. Smoking and pulmonary tuberculosis are risk factors for COPD. In this case, irreversible airflow obstruction is related to COPD and also pulmonary TB. There are several mechanisms that cause airway obstruction in pulmonary tuberculosis, one of which is persistent mycobacterium acting as a co-factor along with smoking and several environmental factors that cause chronic airway inflammation and result in bronchial narrowing with or without parenchymal destruction."

Several studies have linked IgG4-RD to infections such as tuberculosis and actinomycosis. However, the coexistence of IgG4-RD and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) in a single pulmonary nodule has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old male patient presented with cough and sputum. A solitary pulmonary nodule suspicious of lung cancer was found on chest CT. DIAGNOSIS: Through video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy, a diagnosis of co-existing NTM and IgG4-RD in a single nodule was made. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was applied for pneumonia developed after surgery. The patient was also supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation since his pneumonia was refractory to medical treatment. OUTCOMES: The patient expired on the 60th postoperative day due to multiple organ failure. LESSONS: IgG4-RD can occur singularly or accompanied by other diseases. We report a solitary pulmonary nodule caused by NTM and concurrent IgG4-RD, suggesting a possible association between these 2 entities. Immunologic relations between IgG4-RD and accompanying infection should be further investigated."

In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity.

Spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis occurs in rare cases of residual fibrosis with retractions and bullae. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient from a rural area in the province of Los Rios in Babahoyo, Ecuador, with no history of contact with tuberculosis. The patient arrived at the Emergency Department of the Regional Hospital of the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (IESS), Babahoyo, due to acute respiratory failure, preceded by 10 days of evolution due to cough accompanied by greenish expectoration, chest pain, asthenia, and weight loss. On chest radiography, a left pneumothorax and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate were reported. A chest tube was placed, and the patient was intubated and was placed on invasive mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. Use of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF System detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis without resistance to rifampicin. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for the identification of bacillus acid-resistant alcohol was positive in alveolar bronchial lavage. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and phenotypic analysis showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia with carbapenemases resistance mechanism, and the KPC type enzyme was identified. The culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive from the fourth week. CONCLUSIONS Secondary pneumothorax due to rupture of the polymicrobial cavity and especially of tuberculous origin is a very special form of acute respiratory failure in patients with previous structural pulmonary lesions in the Emergency Department."

The diagnosis is often delayed owing to non-specific clinical presentation, misdiagnosis and undiagnosed maternal TB during pregnancy. A 12-day-old girl presented with a 5-day history of fever, cough, poor feeding and respiratory distress. Her mother had a cough and fever at 30 weeks gestation which was managed empirically as community-acquired pneumonia without a TB workup. Immediately postpartum, her mother developed a high fever and shortness of breath and required admission to the intensive care unit. The infant was separated from her mother after delivery. The infant's chest radiograph showed bilateral miliary nodules. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes and congenital TB was suspected. Early morning gastric aspirate and sputum (obtained through a suction tube) were positive for acid-fast bacilli on smear microscopy and subsequently Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from both specimens. Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was compatible with TB meningitis. TB-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) was positive. Her mother was diagnosed with miliary TB on postpartum day 17. Both were given anti-TB chemotherapy. Unfortunately, despite the treatment, the infant died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by congenital TB at the age of 14 days. This case highlights the importance of screening pregnant women for TB in regions where it is highly prevalent. A high index of suspicion of maternal and congenital TB is critical to early diagnosis, especially in such regions."

Here, we present a rare case of primary lung squamous carcinoma in a patient with IPF whose tumor completely regressed following gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy; the cancer was no longer detectable after 2 years upon follow-up. CASE PRESENTATION: Sixty-seven year-old male patient with IPF was admitted to hospital due to acute onset hemoptysis. In addition to a definite usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, a chest CT scan showed a non-enhancing nodular opacity in the right upper lobe and an enhancing nodule in the right lower lobe. Bronchoscopic biopsy of the nodule in the right lower lobe revealed squamous lung cancer. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, the tumor in the right lower lobe was no longer detectable after 2 years of follow-up; however, the nodule in the right upper lobe had increased significantly. Finally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was cultured from the bronchoalveolar (BAL) sample submitted at the last evaluation, and the patient was confirmed to have active pulmonary TB. CONCLUSION: We report the first documented case of complete pulmonary squamous carcinoma regression in IPF following gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Traditional chemotherapy is considered inadequate to cause the resulting regression of the tumor. The concomitant active pulmonary tuberculosis possibly underlies the mechanism."

TB-associated BOF presents either as acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia or as a complication of surgical decompression of thoracic lymph nodes. METHODS: All children with TB- associated BOF were included. TB was diagnosed if MTB was cultured from respiratory secretions, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear was positive, GeneXpert MTB/RIF was positive or a chest radiograph revealed radiographic features typical of TB. BOF was diagnosed by a contrast swallow study and/or flexible bronchoscopy. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, if required. RESULTS: Total of 20 children were diagnosed with TB-associated BOF between 1999 and 2019, with a 75% survival. A total of 85% BOF involved the left main bronchus. A total of 80% of patients were MTB culture or ZN smear-positive. Chest X-ray abnormalities included: extensive parenchymal disease (80%) and lymph gland enlargement (45%). CT features included visualization of the BOF (60%), esophageal air (73%) and pneumomediastinum (40%). BOF closure was achieved by surgical closure (46%), spontaneous closure (26%), fibrin glue (13%), and esophageal stent (13%). Multivariant regression analysis showed that C- reactive protein (CRP), albumin and CRP/albumin ratio were associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Most TB-associated BOF are left-sided. It presents either acutely, with respiratory failure, or with chronic respiratory symptoms of aspiration. Children requiring invasive ventilation have high mortality. Most TB-associated BOF requires surgical intervention, although the use of fibrin glue offers an attractive alternative option."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

We herein, report a case of 40 year old female, with ARDS due to severe pulmonary tuberculosis. She was admitted in the intensive care unit of a tertiary care centre. Owing to very poor ABG report, she was intubated and put on Mechanical ventilator support. Bronchoscopy was performed and BAL was extracted, which showed no growth. Further deterioration of gas exchange prompted the decision to put her on ECMO. During her stay on ECMO, she developed massive inta-alveolar hemorrhage following which repeated bronchoscopic interventions were done to remove blood clots. BAL extracted on day 4 and day 8 showed growth of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae respectively. But BALGeneXpert on day 8 came out to be positive for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and subsequently ATT was added to her treatment regimen. Her alveolar hemorrhage continued to worsen and subsequently ECMO was removed. After 12 days of hospitalization, she went on to develop bradycardia and could not be rescued. Though the patient's life was lost, this case provided many insights on the use of ECMO in the management of ARDS due to Pulmonary tuberculosis and it should be considered as one of the treatment options."

TB and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), if mortality estimates are combined, would rank as the third most common cause of death globally. It is estimated that each year there are approximately 10 million new cases of TB that are associated with approximately 1.2 million deaths, and almost 450 million new episodes of LRTI (synonymous with CAP) with approximately 4 million associated deaths. Globally, Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP. However, although well documented, it is not widely appreciated that in several parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important cause of CAP, if not the most common organism isolated in such settings. Thus, CAP due to M. tuberculosis is not uncommon in some parts of the world with up to a third of cases being attributable to M. tuberculosis. Consequently, TB remains an important clinical entity in the intensive care unit in these settings. Despite its frequency and importance, there are very limited data about TB CAP. In this review we discussed the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, prognosis, and prevention of TB CAP.

Nonetheless, its occurrence in New World primates is unknown, and therefore, this study aimed to describe the infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis variant tuberculosis in two captive black capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) in Southern Brazil. The primates were housed in the same enclosure, wherein close contact with humans frequently occurred, and presented apathy, anorexia, and death in a clinical course of 15 days to 2 months. At the necropsy, the tracheobronchial lymph nodes were markedly enlarged and firm to hard and on the cut surface had a caseous aspect. The lungs exhibited two injury patterns: multifocal and disseminated. Microscopically, the lungs exhibited multifocal to coalescing necrotic granulomas and non-necrotic granulomas, with multiple acid-fast bacilli within the cytoplasm of epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Bacilli were also labeled upon immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Microbiological culture of lung samples from both cases yielded colonies compatible with M. tuberculosis. The isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis var. tuberculosis through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although tuberculosis is poorly described in New World primates, M. tuberculosis var. tuberculosis may cause a highly contagious and progressive disease with high mortality in black capuchin monkeys (S. nigritus)."

First COVID-19 case was detected in March, 10, 2020 in Turkey and as of May, 18, 2020 148,067 cases have been identified and 4096 citizens have died. Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide public health concern, incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) in Turkey was reported at 14, 1 in 2018. During pandemic COVID-19 was the main concern in every clinic and as we discuss here overlapping respiratory diseases may result in delaying of the diagnosis and treatment. METHODOLOGY: There were 4605 respiratory samples examined between March 23 and May 18 for COVID-19 and 185 samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in our laboratory. The Xpert Ultra assay was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in combined nasopharyngeal and deep oropharyngeal swabs of suspected cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Both of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis tests were requested on the clinical and radiological grounds in 30 patients. Here we discussed 2 patients who were both COVID-19 and TB positive. One patient already diagnosed with tuberculosis become COVID-19 positive during hospitalization and another patient suspected and treated for COVID-19 received the final diagnosis of pulmonary TB and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: We want to emphasize that while considering COVID-19 primarily during these pandemic days, we should not forget one of the ""great imitators"", tuberculosis within differential diagnoses."

Here, we describe a case of tubercular osteomyelitis in an old fused hip of a patient with RA who received prednisolone, salazosulfapyridine (SASP), and low-dose methotrexate (MTX). A 77-year-old man with a 4-year history of RA was admitted with a complaint of general fatigue. His symptoms of RA had been well controlled with a combination of prednisolone, SASP, and low-dose MTX. Because the laboratory data showed an increase in serum C-reactive protein levels, we suspected pneumonia. There was expansion of a pre-existing consolidation in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest computed tomography, and the sputum culture was positive for Klebsiella oxytoca. His family physician prescribed empiric antibiotics for pneumonia. Although the QuantiFERON  test result was positive, the acid-fast bacillus staining result was negative in the sputum. He started complaining of pain in his left hip, where arthrodesis was performed for an unknown reason at the age of 20 years. Sonographic examination of his left thigh revealed fluid collection. The aspiration culture of the fluid was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was initiated on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

The diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy is mainly confirmed by bacterial culture, smear staining or histopathology, but has some clinical limitations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), as a new diagnostic technology, has good application prospects in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. Case Presentation: A patient admitted with right pleural effusion and pneumonia was actively treated with anti-infection, anti-inflammatory and symptomatic support while various etiological tests of right pleural effusion were improved. However, all the etiological tests for MTB infection were negative. At this time, the patient's condition worsened and pleural effusion also appeared on the left side. In order to clarify the cause of the disease as soon as possible and prevent the disease from worsening again, the left and right pleural effusions of the patient were sent for NGS testing. The test results suggested MTB infection, which finally clarified the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy, and the next treatment plan of the patient was timely adjusted.

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coinfections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them.

HLH has clinical manifestations related to abnormal prolonged activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with an excess of proinflammatory cytokines. The main causes of secondary HLH are malignancies and infectious diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 54-year-old man, originally from Eastern Africa, who had lived in Northern Europe for 30 years. Here we describe the clinical features, laboratory parameters, diagnostic workup, management and outcome data of a previously healthy 54-year-old man diagnosed with HLH secondary to tuberculosis. The patient was initially treated for a community-acquired pneumonia. He developed multiorgan failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypertransaminasemia, and kidney and bone marrow dysfunction. The clinical course together with a simultaneous increase in serum ferritin raised the suspicion of HLH. The patient fulfilled seven out of eight diagnostic criteria for HLH. A thorough diagnostic workup with respect to HLH and a potential underlying disease was initiated. Cultivation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, stool and urine, and polymerase chain reaction of epithelioid cell granulomas in the bone marrow were all positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was treated for both HLH and tuberculosis, and he survived without any sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: We present one of few published cases of a patient who survived HLH triggered by miliary tuberculosis.

It is an uncommon diagnosis in the Western world, where it is primarily identified in immigrant and immunocompromised populations. CASE REPORT We review a case in which a 47-year-old Nepalese woman with a history of cognitive dysfunction secondary to epilepsy presented with decreased appetite and diffuse abdominal pain. She was hypoxic and febrile on initial exam, and imaging indicated lung consolidation, right-sided pleural effusion, and thickening and nodularity of the omentum with patchy wall thickening of the colon. After failing to improve on a standard antibiotic regimen for treatment of pneumonia and colitis, the differential was broadened to include TB. Interferon-g release assay was subsequently found to be positive, and omental and peritoneal biopsies were obtained. The patient was started on an empiric course of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and pyridoxine. Laboratory testing revealed no immunochemical evidence of Mycobacterium species, however, Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain was positive with rare acid-fast bacilli identified. CONCLUSIONS Peritoneal TB carries significant morbidity and mortality if undiagnosed or untreated. Diagnosis is challenging in the absence of a single test that can confirm or exclude this condition. In combination with clinical suspicion, it is crucial to explore history regarding socio-epidemiology (travel, incarceration, occupation, homelessness, sick contacts) and immunological risk (drug use, chemotherapy) in patients with constitutional symptoms."

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) with visual read-outs are ideal as point-of-care tests. Truenat  MTB is an indigenous chip-based NAAT for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which involves extraction of DNA and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using portable, automated, battery-operated instruments. The current multicentric study was aimed to evaluate Truenat for detection of MTB in sputum samples obtained from patients with presumptive pulmonary TB with reference to culture as gold standard and Xpert as a comparator. Methods: : The study was conducted at four sites, namely ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi; ICMR-National JALMA Institute for Leprosy and Other Mycobacterial Diseases, Agra; and National Institute of TB and Respiratory Diseases, New Delhi. Patients suspected to have TB were screened for eligibility. Two sputum samples were collected from each patient. Tests included smear, Xpert and Truenat directly from the sputum sample and culture by Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium and MGIT960 from decontaminated pellets. Sample used for Truenat assay was coded. Resolution of Truenat false positives was done using an in-house PCR with TRC4 primers. Results: : The study enrolled 2419 presumptive TB patients after screening 2465 patients, and 3541 sputum samples were collected from the enrolled patients. Results of 2623 samples were available for analysis. Truenat showed a positivity rate of 48.5 per cent as compared to 37.0 per cent by Xpert.

All 629 newly registered sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients were enrolled over 12 months. Sputum samples were tested using the Xpert  MTB/RIF assay and targeted next-generation sequencing (Deeplex Myc-TB) to identify resistance and explore the phylogenetics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains.RESULTS: Drug resistance profiles were obtained for 555 patients (502 new, 53 previously treated). The prevalence of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) was respectively 2.0% and 7.6% among new and previously treated cases. All RR-TB isolates that were susceptible to isoniazid displayed a phylogenetic marker conferring capreomycin resistance, confirming circulation of a previously described resistant TB sub-lineage in the Horn of Africa. Only one case of fluoroquinolone resistance was detected.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of rifampicin resistance among TB patients is encouragingly low. The scarcity of fluoroquinolone resistance bodes well for the success of the recommended all-oral treatment regimen. Surveillance based on molecular approaches enables a reliable estimation of the burden of resistance and can be used to guide appropriate treatment and care."

Owing to a myriad of clinical presentations and discrepancies in the diagnostic modalities, patients usually present late, which results in a high number of them requiring surgical intervention. The present study aims to retrospectively analyze the role of surgery in genitourinary tuberculosis. <br><b>Patients and method:</b> All patients diagnosed with genitourinary tuberculosis at our centre between October 2017 and September 2019 were included in the study. The mode of presentation, duration of symptoms, investigations performed, treatment received, and follow-up were studied. <br><b>Results:</b> Out of 25 patients diagnosed with genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB), there were 15 (60%) males and 10 (40%) females. The mean age of presentation was 40.84 years. Nineteen (76%) patients underwent surgical intervention, and many patients required more than one surgical procedure. A reconstructive procedure was carried out in seven patients. At a median follow-up of 12 months, all patients did well, showing no relapse. <br><b>Conclusion:</b> Surgery, along with antitubercular treatment, is the key to the management of GUTB presenting with structural damage. However, surgery can be ablative or reconstructive, depending on various factors discussed in the present study. This preserves or restores the optimal function of the genitourinary system affected by the mycobacterium bacilli."

Study of 30 episodes].ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: To analyse the etiology, diagnostic methods and response to therapy in 30 episodes of pneumonia diagnosed in 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) between 1995 and 2000. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In each episode of pneumonia the following data were analysed: age, gender, treatment of CLL, antiinfectious prophylaxis, granulocytopenia, CD4/CD8 lymphocytes ratio, hipogammaglobulinemia, origin of pneumonia (nosocomial or community-acquired), localisation, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy and response. Diagnostic methods included blood and sputum cultures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and search for antigens in urine (Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, galactomannan, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). RESULTS: Median age of the series was 60 yr. (range 50-86) and 12 patients were male. Chlorambucil and prednisone were used in 13 cases and fludarabine in 8. Granulocytopenia was present in 14 episodes, hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in 22 and CD4/CD8 ratio was lower than 1 in 8 out of 14 evaluable cases. Etiology of pneumonia was established in 16 episodes (53%). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the most useful technique (83% of positive diagnoses) followed by blood cultures (38%). Two patients were diagnosed of aspergillosis at autopsy. Pneumococcus was the most frequent agent (5 cases) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Pneumocystis carinii (2) and Aspergillus fumigatus (2). One out of the two patients with P. carinii pneumonia had received fludarabin and the remaining was treated with prednisone for long time. Ten patients (30%) had died: P. aeruginosa (3 cases), P. carinii (2), A. fumigatus (2), Mycobacterium xenopi (1), and unknown microorganism (2). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of CLL patients the frequency of etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias was good. Pneumococcus was the most frequent microorganism.

M. xenopi is currently one of the most common NTM pathogens in parts of England and Canada and has been reported in parts of the northeastern United States. Whether the isolation of M. xenopi from our patient in Tennessee represents a new geographic distribution of this organism or technologic advancements that now allow for reliable identification is debatable.

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the morphotype, immunophenotype, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genotype in a large cohort with PNTM. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 63 patients with PNTM infection, each of whom had computerized tomography, echocardiogram, pulmonary function, and flow cytometry of peripheral blood. In vitro cytokine production in response to mitogen, LPS, and cytokines was performed. Anthropometric measurements were compared with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) age- and ethnicity-matched female control subjects extracted from the NHANES 2001-2002 dataset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 59.9 (+/-9.8 yr [SD]) old, and 5.4 (+/-7.9 yr) from diagnosis to enrollment. Patients were 95% female, 91% white, and 68% lifetime nonsmokers. A total of 46 were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex, M. xenopi, or M. kansasii; 17 were infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria. Female patients were significantly taller (164.7 vs. 161.0 cm; P &lt; 0.001) and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 28.2; P &lt; 0.001) than matched NHANES control subjects, and thinner (body mass index, 21.1 vs. 26.8; P = 0.002) than patients with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. A total of 51% of patients had scoliosis, 11% pectus excavatum, and 9% mitral valve prolapse, all significantly more than reference populations. Stimulated cytokine production was similar to that of healthy control subjects, including the IFN-gamma/IL-12 pathway. CD4(+), CD8(+), B, and natural killer cell numbers were normal. A total of 36% of patients had mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNTM infection are taller and leaner than control subjects, with high rates of scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve prolapse, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations, but without recognized immune defects."

However, NTM are a heterogeneous group and most of the data come from only three species: Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus. Still, information about these three species is confusing because it is based mainly on retrospective studies and series of clinical cases performed in developed countries. In recent years, new information has appeared about other species and the pathogenesis of NTM. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that NTM infection is a worldwide phenomenon with an increasing presence in developing countries perhaps because of the implementation of tap water. Women with characteristic phenotype are at higher risk of acquiring NTM infection along with patients with defects on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. New studies on Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium szulgai and Mycobacterium simiae indicate that the American Thoracic Society criteria for diagnosing NTM disease may not be useful for all species of NTM. SUMMARY: New multicentric and prospective studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of NTM. These organisms form a numerous and heterogeneous group and each species should be studied separately."

METHODS: The medical records of 279 consecutive PM/DM patients in 3 medical centers were reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred four severe infections occurred in our patients (37.3%), ie, pyogenic (n = 71) and nonpyogenic/opportunistic infections (n = 33). Pyogenic infections were mainly due to aspiration pneumonia (n = 46) and calcinosis cutis infection. Thirty-three PM/DM patients developed nonpyogenic/opportunistic infections that were due to the following: Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Aspergillus fumigatus, Geotrichum capitatum, Mycobacterium (avium-intracellulare complex, xenopi, marinum, peregrinum, tuberculosis), Helicobacter heilmanii, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex and zoster virus, hepatitis B and C, JC virus, Leishmania major, Strongyloides stercoralis. Esophageal dysfunction, ventilatory insufficiency, malignancy, and lymphopenia were significantly more frequent in the group of PM/DM patients with infections. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the high frequency of infections in PM/DM, resulting in an increased mortality rate. Our results suggest that prophylaxis against pyogenic infections should be routinely recommended for patients with PM/DM, including regular physical examination of lungs to depict aspiration pneumonia as well as risk factors of aspiration pneumonia. Finally, because a great variety of micro-organisms may be responsible for opportunistic infections, it seems difficult to initiate primary prophylaxis in PM/DM patients exhibiting risk factors for opportunistic infections."

The utility of specific CT scan features, although often available long before respiratory sample cultures, is not fully understood. We sought to assess associations among CT features, symptoms and microbiological disease criteria in pulmonary Mycobacterium xenopi isolation. METHODS: We reviewed 70 consecutive immunocompetent patients with pulmonary M. xenopi isolation and classified them according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) diagnostic criteria for disease. 'Definite disease' patients (n = 16) met modified ATS criteria. 'Possible disease' patients (n = 10) met microbiological criteria, had abnormal CT scans, but data regarding symptoms were unavailable. 'No disease' patients (n = 44) had only one positive sputum culture, or were asymptomatic or had no relevant CT findings. Two radiologists, without knowledge of the clinical or microbiological information, independently reviewed the scans. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of all patients was 63 (16) years, and 39% were women. Patients with 'definite disease' usually had nodules (88%) and cavities (63%), but less often bronchiectasis (50%) and tree-in-bud (50%). Patients with 'possible' or 'no disease', respectively, had nodules (100% or 80%), bronchiectasis (40% or 18%) or tree-in-bud (40% or 11%).

Diagnosis of infections caused by NTM is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological findings. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of non-tuberculous mycobacterial species isolated from clinical specimens as etiologic agents. The NTM strains isolated from clinical specimens in National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL), together with the strains that were sent to NTRL for the advanced identification of non-tuberculous mycobacterial species that have clinical or microbiological significance, were analysed retrospectively.

The other types of NTM species identified in our laboratory were M.chelonae (n= 3), M.intracellulare (n= 3), M.kansasii (n= 3), M.peregrinum (n= 2), M.scrofulaceum (n= 2), M.szulgai (n= 2), M.celatum (n= 1), M.haemophilum (n= 1), M.smegmatis (n= 1) and M.xenopi (n= 1). Rapidly growing NTM species (M.fortuitum and M.abscessus) were the most frequent (52%) species isolated in our laboratory as the cause of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. Interestingly, the majority of M.fortuitum isolates (n= 21) which was the most common species identified in our laboratory, were those received from the peripheral laboratories. The most common species identified in our laboratory were rapidly growing NTM, however the countrywide distribution of the NTM species was found different than previously reported. In conclusion, further investigation of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria profile in adjunct with epidemiological data seems to be essential in our country."

","SPECIES:Mycobacterium xenopiID:23460010TITLE:Diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections.ABSTRACT:The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are typically environmental organisms residing in soil and water. Although generally of low pathogenicity to humans, NTM can cause a wide array of clinical diseases; pulmonary disease is most frequent, followed by lymphadenitis in children, skin disease by M. marinum (particularly in fish tank fanciers), and other extrapulmonary or disseminated infections in severely immunocompromised patients. Of the &gt;140 NTM species reported in the literature, 25 species have been strongly associated with NTM diseases; the remainder are environmental organisms rarely encountered in clinical samples. Correct species identification is very important because NTM species differ in their clinical relevance. Further, NTM differ strongly in their growth rate, temperature tolerance, and drug susceptibility. The diagnosis of NTM disease is complex and requires good communication between clinicians, radiologists, and microbiologists. Isolation of M. kansasii and (in northwestern Europe) M. malmoense from pulmonary specimens usually indicates disease, whereas Mycobacterium gordonae and, to a lesser extent, M. simiae or M. chelonae are typically contaminants rather than causative agents of true disease. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. xenopi, and M. abscessus form an intermediate category between these two extremes. This review covers the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of NTM diseases and particularities for the different disease types and patient populations. Because of limited sensitivity and specificity of symptoms, radiology, and direct microscopy of clinical samples, culture remains the gold standard. Yet culture is time consuming and demands the use of multiple media types and incubation temperatures to optimize the yield. Outside of reference centers, such elaborate culture algorithms are scarce."

DESIGN: We identified all patients with culture-proven PTB in Ontario, Canada, in 2004, identified those with NTM 'co-isolation' (&lt;=6 months following initial TB isolate) and determined subsequent NTM isolation over 5 years. RESULTS: In 2004, 369 people in Ontario had culture-proven PTB (average age 46 years, SD 21, 41% female). NTM co-isolation occurred in 11% (40/369), including Mycobacterium avium complex 22/40 (55%), M. xenopi 7/40 (18%), M. gordonae 6/40 (15%) and others 5/40 (13%). Patients with NTM co-isolation were older (55 vs. 45 years, P = 0.004), but had similar sex ratios (females 43% vs. 40%, P = 0.87). Among patients with co-isolation, 23% (9/40) went on to have &gt;=2 NTM cultures (excluding initial culture), compared with 3% (10/329) in the PTB group (including initial culture, P = 0.0001). In the co-isolation group, the median (quartiles) number of samples collected for mycobacterial study was 6 (4-8) compared to 2 (1-4) in the PTB group (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of subsequent NTM isolation among patients with NTM co-isolation during PTB may warrant follow-up for potential NTM disease."

To provide a snapshot of NTM species distribution, global partners in the NTM-Network European Trials Group (NET) framework (www.ntm-net.org), a branch of the Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (TB-NET), provided identification results of the total number of patients in 2008 in whom NTM were isolated from pulmonary samples. From these data, we visualised the relative distribution of the different NTM found per continent and per country. We received species identification data for 20 182 patients, from 62 laboratories in 30 countries across six continents. 91 different NTM species were isolated. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria predominated in most countries, followed by M. gordonae and M. xenopi. Important differences in geographical distribution of MAC species as well as M. xenopi, M. kansasii and rapid-growing mycobacteria were observed. This snapshot demonstrates that the species distribution among NTM isolates from pulmonary specimens in the year 2008 differed by continent and differed by country within these continents. These differences in species distribution may partly determine the frequency and manifestations of pulmonary NTM disease in each geographical location. "

Saudi Arabia is not an exception as there have been novel mycobacterial species also identified. In addition, several published case reports from different parts of the country suggest a growing pathogenic potential of NTM. As the first nationwide study, we sought to gain an insight into the species diversity of NTM clinical isolates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During June 2009-July 2010, 95 clinical isolates were collected from tuberculosis reference laboratories in major provinces within Saudi Arabia and subjected to standard line probe assay techniques to identify their species. Diagnostic guidelines of the American Thoracic Society were applied to determine the clinical relevance of respiratory isolates. Species diversity (13 species) was very high and dominated (61.0%) by rapid growing NTM. The major species obtained were Mycobacterium abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. intracellulare followed by M. kansassi, M. gordanae and M. avium. Interestingly this study reports for the first time the clinical relevance of M. celatum, M. xenopi, M. scrofulceum, M. lentiflavum, M. asiaticum and M. simiae in Saudi Arabia. Of the total, 67.1% were clinically relevant respiratory cases, 23.2% were non-respiratory cases and 9.7% were respiratory colonizers. Coexisting illness was reported in 53.7% of the studied cases. The major risk factors observed among the patients were previous history of tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The high rates of clinically confirmed respiratory cases suggest that NTM infections are indeed a new challenge to health authorities. The current findings show an opposite picture of the Western world where M. avium complex and particularly slow growing NTM are the most predominant respiratory pathogens. The complexity of species demands an immediate strengthening of the current diagnostic facilities."

It affects an elderly population, often with underlying chronic lung diseases, but its epidemiology shows significant regional variation. Guidelines and recommendations for treatment of these infections exist, but build strongly on expert opinion, as very few good quality clinical trials have been performed in this field. Only for the most frequent causative agents, the Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus, a reasonable number of trials and case series is now available. For the less frequent causative agents of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease (Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonae) data is mostly limited to a few very small case series. Within this review, we have collected and combined evidence from all available trials and case series.

We retrospectively described and compared computed tomography (CT) chest manifestations of disease caused by MAC and M xenopi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed patients who had either MAC or M xenopi lung disease and who had CTs between January 2002 and December 2003. Clinical data were recorded, and the patterns on chest CTs were categorized as ""fibrocavitary,"" ""nodular bronchiectatic,"" and ""unclassified."" RESULTS: There were 74 patients; 50 with MAC and 24 with M xenopi. The patients with MAC were older (mean 69 vs 58 years; P = .007). Patients with M xenopi more often had emphysema (50% vs 20%; P = .02), cavities (46% vs 16%; P = .01), and nodules &lt;=5 mm (88% vs 58%; P = .02). M xenopi cases more commonly had a fibrocavitary radiologic pattern (33% vs 18%), with no statistically significant difference (P = .24). MAC was more often associated with a nodular bronchiectatic pattern (68% MAC vs 4% M xenopi; P &lt; .0001). Sixty-three percent of patients with M xenopi had a pattern that was predominantly randomly distributed nodules (11/15 [73%]) or consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities (4/15 [27%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with MAC, patients with M xenopi infection develop more cavities and more nodules, and they less often have a predominant nodular bronchiectatic pattern. Although a predominantly cavitary pattern appears to be more common with M xenopi, the majority of patients with M xenopi had CT patterns of random nodules or consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities rather than classically described findings."

Their distribution patterns are subject to geographical variations. This study describes their isolation frequencies from clinical specimen in the three French overseas departments of the Americas, namely, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana during 1994-2012. A total of 651 strains from as many patients (one isolate per species per patient) were analysed regarding regional isolation patterns and potential pattern changes over time. The Mycobacterium avium complex was the most common group of NTM in Guadeloupe and French Guiana. In Martinique it was the second most common after the rapidly growing mycobacteria. M. fortuitum was the most commonly isolated species in all three departments. Some species (M. kansasii, M. xenopi, and M. terrae complex) displayed a clear regional preference. Furthermore a change in isolation frequency was observed for M. intracellulare (increase) and M. kansasii (decrease) in Guadeloupe. In conclusion, marked regional differences in isolation frequencies of NTM species were observed in the study area. Results are discussed in context of variables such as study populations, risk factors, methodology employed, isolation from pulmonary versus sterile isolation sites (blood, urine, and CSF), and in vitro drug-susceptibility patterns.

However, 2 y later, a repeat chest x-ray showed the original right upper lobe cavity with an interval development of a mass adjoining the cavity. A CT-guided needle biopsy of the new mass demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma. Whenever there is a change in the radiological appearance of a cavity, a repeat biopsy should be performed to exclude lung cancer. "

Their clinical relevance is still largely unknown as well as predictors for mortality in affected patients. The objective was to describe prevalence and clinical relevance of different NTM and to identify risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 124 patients with NTM detection between January 2001 and December 2011. Clinical characteristics like symptoms and radiological appearance were assessed at presentation. The primary outcome was all cause mortality during the follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard models were employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Over the study period, the frequency of NTM isolation varied from 4 to 12 patients per year. Twenty-nine out of 124 patients (23%) had a clinically relevant infection, according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Mycobacterium avium was isolated most frequently, but Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium malmoense and Mycobacterium xenopi had the highest clinical relevance. Symptoms were mostly diverse and non-specific. On radiology, cavities were observed more frequently than a nodular-bronchiectatic variant or consolidation. In 75% of all patients, follow up time was more than two years. Median survival was 6.5 years (95%CI = 2.7-10.3). Factors significantly influencing survival time were haemoptysis (HR = 0.2, 95%CI = 0.1-0.6) and a consolidation on imaging (HR = 5.1, 95%CI 1.4-18.2). CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of an infection with NTM can be diverse and depends mainly on the causative NTM pathogen. The most important predictor for increased mortality is the radiological appearance of a consolidation."

While a number of studies worldwide have described an increasing prevalence of NTM pulmonary disease over time, population-based data are relatively sparse and subject to ascertainment bias. Furthermore, the disease is geographically heterogeneous. While some species are commonly implicated worldwide (Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium abscessus), others (e.g., Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium xenopi) are regionally important. Thoracic computed tomography, microbiological testing with identification to the species level, and local epidemiology must all be taken into account to accurately diagnose NTM pulmonary disease. A diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease does not necessarily imply that treatment is required; a patient-centered approach is essential. When treatment is required, multidrug therapy based on appropriate susceptibility testing for the species in question should be used.

Chronic pulmonary infection is the most common clinical manifestation. Although patients suffering from chronic lung diseases are particularly susceptible to NTM pulmonary disease, many affected patients have no apparent risk factors. Host and pathogen factors leading to NTM pulmonary disease are not well understood and preventive therapies are lacking. NTM isolation and pulmonary disease are reported to rise in frequency in Europe as well as in other parts of the world. Differentiation between contamination, infection, and disease remains challenging. Treatment of NTM pulmonary disease is arduous, lengthy, and costly. Correlations between results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing and clinical treatment outcomes are only evident for the Mycobacterium avium complex, M. kansasii, and some rapidly growing mycobacteria. We describe the epidemiology of NTM pulmonary disease as well as emerging NTM pathogens and their geographical distribution in non-cystic fibrosis patients in Europe. We also review recent innovations for the diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease, summarize treatment recommendations, and identify future research priorities to improve the management of patients affected by NTM pulmonary disease.

Although the American Thoracic Society published the guidelines for diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD), the diagnosis is still difficult. In the first part of the study, we collected data on NTM isolates in the Mycobacteriology Laboratory of Careggi Hospital (Florence, Italy) and analysed the epidemiological data of NTM isolates. Then, to analyse the risk factors associated to NTM-PD, we studied the presence of ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM-PD in patients who had at least one positive respiratory sample for NTM and were admitted to the Infectious Disease Unit and the Section of Respiratory Medicine. We selected 88 patients with available full clinical data and, according to ATS/IDSA criteria, classified 15 patients (17%) as NTM-PD cases and 73 as colonized patients (83%). When comparing colonized and NTM-PD patients we did not find significant differences of age, gender and comorbidity. We observed that Mycobacterium avium and M. intracellulare were statistically associated with NTM-PD (P = 0 001) whereas M. xenopi was statistically associated with colonization. Although the number of studied patients is limited, our study did not identify risk factors for NTM-PD that could help clinicians to discriminate between colonization and disease. We underline the need of close monitoring of NTM-infected patients until the diagnosis is reasonably excluded. Further larger prospective studies and new biological markers are needed to identify new useful tools for the diagnosis of NTM-PD."

This multicentre, review aims to characterise NTM disease meeting ATS/IDSA criteria and define factors associated with initiation of treatment. METHODS: Sputum samples growing NTM from 5 London hospitals between 2010 and 2014 were identified. Data for HIV-negative individuals meeting ATS/IDSA guidelines for pulmonary NTM disease were extracted. Associations between clinical variables and treatment decision were investigated using Chi-squared, Fishers-exact or Mann Whitney tests. Factors associated with treatment in univariate analysis (p &lt; 0.150) were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: NTM were identified from 817 individuals' sputum samples. 108 met ATS/IDSA criteria. 42/108 (39%) were initiated on treatment. Median age was 68 (56-78) in the cohort. On multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with treatment of pulmonary NTM infection were: Cavitation on HRCT (OR: 6.49; 95% CI: 2.36-17.81), presenting with night sweats (OR 4.18; 95% CI: 1.08-16.13), and presenting with weight loss (OR 3.02; 95% CI: 1.15-7.93). Of those treated, 18(43%) have completed treatment, 9(21%) remain on treatment, 10(24%) stopped due to side effects, 5(12%) died during treatment.

Reports of NTM epidemiology are mainly focused on pulmonary infections and isolations, and extrapulmonary infections are less frequently described. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of NTM infections at the Bordeaux University Hospital, France, between January 2002 and December 2013. We used the microbiologic component of the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America's pulmonary NTM disease criteria to define cases of pulmonary NTM, and patients with isolates from a normally sterile site were classified as having extrapulmonary disease. RESULTS: In our setting, 170 patients were included. Pulmonary cases predominated (54.1%), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (22.9%), disseminated cases (10.6%), lymphadenitis (7.7%), bone and joint infections (2.9%) and the remaining 1.8% catheter-related infections. Overall, 16 NTM species were isolated. Mycobacterium avium (31.8%) and M. intracellulare (20%) were the most common species identified, followed by M. marinum (13.5%), M. kansasii (10.6%), M. xenopi (9.4%), rapidly growing mycobacteria (9.4%) and other slowly growing mycobacteria (5.3%). In general, NTM isolates were largely prevalent in people older than 50 (62.4%); patients aged 1-10 year-old exclusively yielded M. avium from lymph nodes, almost cases having being diagnosed after 2007. Among the 121 patients with complete follow-up, 78 (64.5%), 24 (19.8%), and 19 (15.7%) were cured, experienced relapse, or died, respectively. CONCLUSION: In our study, extrapulmonary NTM infections represented almost half of cases, consisting mainly in skin and soft tissue infections. The increase lymphadenitis cases in children after 2007 could be linked to the cessation of mandatory BCG vaccination in France.

OBJECTIVES: To improve knowledge of geographic variance of NTM species, to correlate detailed clinical information with isolation of specific NTM, and to examine the decision to treat and outcomes for specific NTM. METHODS: Mycobacterial cultures submitted to the University of Washington mycobacterial laboratory from 1998 to 2011 were examined. We report isolation frequency and demographic information from all samples with clinical variables. We also examined treatment decisions and outcomes in a subset of patients with Mycobacterium abscessus complex, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium lentiflavum, Mycobacterium porcinum, and Mycobacterium xenopi. RESULTS: Cultures of NTM were available from 3,470 patients, 937 of whom had clinical data available. When we compared patients born within or outside Washington State, we found that the mycobacterial species frequency varied. Among 168 patients with one of the studied environmental mycobacteria, 72% had major comorbid conditions. Bronchiectasis was common among patients with pulmonary isolation of any NTM, including those with nonpathogenic M. gordonae. Although mortality was high (37%), few deaths were directly attributable to mycobacterial infection. Among 56 patients who met American Thoracic Society criteria for NTM lung disease, 22 were treated, and 19 of those had M. abscessus complex and M. kansasii. The treatment regimens used tended to follow published guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation of NTM varied by geographic region of origin and location within Washington State. Several clinical risk factors were specific to individual species. Comorbid conditions were common in patients with and without mycobacterial disease. Among patients with one of the studied organisms, there was a high mortality rate more frequently related to comorbid conditions than to mycobacterial disease."

METHODS: A systematic review of non-Mycobacterium avium complex studies published prior to October 2016 was conducted with respect to microbiological and clinical outcomes of current treatment regimens. RESULTS: We retrieved 352 citations, which yielded 24 studies eligible for evaluation. Sixteen studies were retrospective chart reviews, three studies were prospective, and only five studies were randomized. The weighted average proportion of sputum culture conversion (SCC) after subtracting posttreatment relapses for patients with M abscessus was 41.2% (95% CI, 28.6%-54.5%) but was 69.8% (95% CI, 41.0%-91.9%) with subspecies M massiliense in macrolide-containing regimens, 80.2% (95% CI, 58.4%-95.2%) in patients with M kansasii, 32.0% (95% CI, 16.5%-49.8%) for M xenopi (MX) and 54.4% (95% CI, 34.7%-73.4%) for M malmoense. SCCs in the total of 55 patients who underwent lung resection and had MX or M abscessus was high at 75.9%. The risk of bias was low in four of five randomized studies. However, heterogeneous use of outcome parameters (eight definitions of ""relapse,"" eight of ""treatment success,"" and four of ""cure"") hampered comparison of nonrandomized studies as well as producing possible bias by a posteriori exclusion (13.3%) and uncompleted treatment of participants (25.3%). CONCLUSIONS: As a sustained microbiological response without surgery is unsatisfactory in treating M abscessus, MX, and M malmoense, functional and quality of life aspects should be given more emphasis in the individual evaluation of treatment outcome. Further, properly planned studies with sufficient power are needed, as are new drugs or better-tolerated application of current antibiotics, or both."

Fatal cavitary infection in a patient without immunosuppression is rarely presented. Case report: A 62-year-old female with history of sarcoidosis and hypertension presented with cough, fever and dyspnea for one week. Chest imaging showed irregular opacification of upper lung zones. The sputum samples tested positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and the subsequent testing identified M. xenopi. She was started on rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol along with azithromycin, and was discharged with plans to continue the same. A follow up sputum test was negative for AFB. She was, however, readmitted ten months later with sepsis due to pneumonia. Chest imaging revealed worsening cavitary lung lesions. Despite starting her on intravenous antibiotics while continuing anti-tubercular therapy, she developed severe respiratory distress and had to be intubated. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she expired the following day. Conclusion: Fatal cavitary infections with M. xenopi have been reported in the absence of established optimal management. Well-designed studies with sufficient power are needed to establish new treatment guidelines."

The chest pain was localized to the left lower chest and increased with movement and deep breathing. The patient did not complain weight loss, night sweat, fever or chill. He complained of mild cough, with expectoration of whitish mucus. Imaging revealed cavitary chest lesion in the right upper lobe, which was initially suspected to be lung cancer. The patient had a 50-year-old history of smoking 2 packs per day. PET CT imaging did not reveal any specific activity. Needle biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage, however, did not reveal any malignant cells. Rather, necrotic tissues were observed. A wedge resection of the lung mass was performed. No common organisms or fungi could be grown. However, acid fast bacilli were observed in clumps. The morphology hinted towards non-tuberculous mycobacterial organism(s). Molecular studies revealed infection with Mycobacterium xenopi. The patient was started on an anti-tuberculous regimen of INH, rifampicin, ethambutol and PZA, with pyridoxine. The patient is a Vietnam veteran and complained of exposure to dust from a bird's nest and asbestos exposure in childhood, but no specific exposure to tuberculosis. The patient had an uneventful recovery post-surgery. He complained of some nausea after initiation of the antituberculous medications, but his pain subsided with time. The patient had diabetes, though specific reasons of compromise of immune status could not be pinpointed as causative of his nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infection."

The aim of the study was to determine the most relevant clinical characteristics of NTM during the 7-year period. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective study of NTM infections was conducted between January 2009 and December 2016. The American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America criteria were used to define cases of pulmonary or an extrapulmonary site. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were included in the study. Pulmonary cases predominated 83/85 (98%), while extrapulmonary NTM were present in 2/95 (2%) patients. Overall, ten different NTM species were isolated. The most common organisms were slow-growing mycobacteria (SGM) presented in 70/85 (82.35%) patients. Isolated SGM strains were Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in 25/85 (29.41%) patients, M. xenopi in 20/85 (23.53%) patients, M. kansasii in 15/85 (17.65%) patients and M. peregrinum and M. gordonae in 5/85 (5.88%) patients each. Isolated rapid-growing mycobacteria (RGM) strains were M. abscessus in 8/85 (9.41%) patients, M. fortuitum in 4/85 (4.71%) patients and M. chelonae in 3/85 (3.53%) patients. Almost all patients (98%; 83/85) had comorbidities. Among 75 (88.24%) patients who completed follow-up, 59 (69.41%), 10 (11.76%) and 6 (7%), were cured, experienced relapse and died, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the present study, pulmonary NTM infections were more frequent compared to extrapulmonary disease forms. SGM were most common isolates with MAC pulmonary disease the most frequently found. Comorbidities have an important role in NTM occurrence. Further investigation should focus on an NTM drug susceptibility testing."

However, the significance of MALDI-TOF MS for identifying mycobacteria, particularly rare nontuberculous mycobacteria, has not been established. M. heckeshornense is one such bacteria, and distinguishing it from M. xenopi is difficult. The patient was a 40-year-old man with Behset's disease who had started treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine. A lung nodule in the right lower lobe was pointed out, and it increased in size 6 months later. Bronchoscopy was performed, and was culture positive for mycobacteria. It was identified as M. heckeshornense by MALDI-TOF MS with a score value of 1.928. Analysis of the 16S rRNA, rpoB, and hsp65 genes confirmed the result of MALDI-TOF MS.

Data regarding comparative and long-term outcomes are limited. We aimed to review indications and outcomes of adjuvant lung resection for NTM-PD compared with controls. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 27 surgically treated patients, matched 1:1 for age, sex, NTM species, and radiologic pattern of disease, with control patients treated exclusively with antibiotics. RESULTS: In the surgical group, the median (IQR) age was 55 (49-61) years and 74.1% were female. Eighteen patients had Mycobacterium avium complex, and 9 had M. xenopi. Operations included 8 pneumonectomies, 20 lobectomies, one segmentectomy and one lobectomy plus segmentectomy. Post-surgical complications occurred in 6 patients (20%), including 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome, 1 bronchopleural fistula, 1 pericardial tamponade, and 2 empyema. Complications were more common among patients operated upon for progressive disease despite medical therapy (OR 10, p = 0.025). Of 24 matched pairs followed for &gt;=1 year, sustained culture conversion was observed in 21 (87.5%) patients in the surgical group and in 11 (45.8%) patients in the non-surgical group (RR 2.36, 95%CI 1.37-4.03, p = 0.002). Median (IQR) percentage of follow-up time on antibiotics was 14% (0-100%) in the surgical group and 83% (10.8%-100%) in the non-surgical group (p = 0.195) during a median (IQR) follow-up of 16 (2-36) months. CONCLUSIONS: NTM-PD patients who underwent adjuvant lung resection experienced significant morbidity and more frequently achieved sputum culture conversion. Long term antibiotic requirements may have been reduced."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 363 NTM strains: 177 MAC (161 M. avium, 16 M. intracellulare), 112 M. kansasii and 74 M. xenopi collected from the respiratory material of the patients were under the treatment or under diagnostic procedures at our Center, affiliates and the diagnostic department in 2010-2016. Drug sucseptibility for NTM was tested using the Sensititre SLOWMYCO system (TREK DIAGNOSTIC Systems Ltd., UK). MICs were established by microdilutions in Mueller-Hinton broth on polystyrene 96-well plates. The statistical analysis was done using the StatGraphics Plus 5.0 software. The data were compared pairwise using Pearson chi2 test with Yates correction. 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Statistically significant differences were considered for p &lt;0.05. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the concentration-dependent surveillance probability. RESULTS: The statistically significant differences were revealed in sensitivity/resistance isolates of M. avium and M. intracellulare: M. avium strains were resistant to higher concentrations of amikacin, clarithromycin, linezolid and streptomycin (p &lt;0.01); M. intracellulare strains were resistant to higher concentrations of ethionamide (p &lt;0.05). The isolates of M. avium were significantly more resistant than M. kansasii to amikacin, doxycycline, isoniazid, clarithromycin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifabutin, rifampicin, streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, ethionamide (visible growth of M. avium were inhibited by higher drug concentrations, p &lt;0.01). The isolates of M. avium showed significantly higher resistance than M. xenopi to amikacin, doxycycline, isoniazid, clarithromycin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, and ethionamide (visible growth of M. avium were inhibited by higher drug concentrations, p &lt;0.01). Statistically significant differences in the dynamics of the response to the antibacterial effects of isoniazid, linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ethambutol, and ethionamide were found for M. intracellulare and M. xenopi (complete inhibition of the visible growth of M. intracellulare required higher drugs concentrations, p &lt;0, 05). Comparison of the Kaplan-Meyer curves revealed statistically significant differences in survialence probability of M. kansasii and M. xenopi for amikacin, doxycycline, rifampicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, and ethionamide (a higher number of isolates of M. xenopi were inhibited by low drugs concentrations, p &lt;0.05).

Cases of disease in veterinary medicine remain scarce. Few animal species, including birds, are suspected of being vectors of the disease and there has not yet been a report of clinical disease in birds. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of systemic infection in a domestic bird. Case presentation: A female fiery-shouldered conure was submitted after death for necropsy following episodes of heavy breathing. The necropsy revealed multiple granulomatous lesions within the liver, air sacs and kidneys. Ziehl-Neelsen stains demonstrated the presence of numerous intralesional acid-fast bacilli. PCR assays and culture confirmed the presence of M. xenopi. Conclusion: Through this case we hope to describe the characteristics of M. xenopi disease in birds and the possible close relationship between animal and human infections."

Associations between radiological pattern and clinical features and outcomes are inadequately studied in Mxe-PD. We sought to investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes according to the dominant radiological pattern among patients with Mxe-PD. We retrospectively studied patients with Mxe-PD seen in our clinic, categorizing their predominant CT pattern as nodular bronchiectasis, fibrocavitary, or unclassifiable, and compared clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes between radiologic groups. Of 94 patients with Mxe-PD, CT patterns comprised nodular bronchiectasis (40/94, 42.6%), fibrocavitary (37/94, 39.4%), and unclassifiable (17/94, 18.1%). Compared with fibrocavitation, patients with nodular bronchiectasis were female dominant, less often had COPD, less often had AFB smear-positive sputum, and more frequently had co-isolation of Pseudomonas. Patients with nodular bronchiectasis were less often treated (65% versus 91.9%) and when treated, they received fewer anti-mycobacterial drugs (on average 3 versus 4). Outcomes did not differ significantly by radiological pattern. Nodular bronchiectasis was common among Mxe-PD patients in our clinic. Compared with fibrocavitary disease, patients with nodular bronchiectasis had features suggestive of milder disease and were less often treated.

Mycobacterium xenopi (M. xenopi) has low pathogenicity and usually requires either host immune impairment, as in the case of a human immunodeficiency virus infection, or a structural lung disease to cause a clinical disease. Comorbidities have an essential role in M. xenopi occurrence. Herein, we present a rare case of pulmonary cavitary disease caused by M. xenopi complicated by respiratory failure and superinfection in a patient with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An 81-year-old woman presented to the hospital with the chief concerns of shortness of breath and productive cough lasting a few weeks before presentation. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed a right upper lobe, thick-walled, cavitary lesion measuring 2.1 cm x 4.3 cm x 3.1 cm with associated bronchiectasis and pleural parenchymal scarring. One year ago, the patient underwent bronchoscopy for a right upper lobe cavitary lesion, which revealed M. xenopi on bronchoalveolar lavage culture. During the current admission, she was started on rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and clarithromycin because the M. xenopi was clinically significant and fulfilled the American Thoracic Society diagnostic criteria for NTM lung disease. A diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease does not necessarily suggest that treatment is required. The distinction between colonization and illness may be difficult upon the isolation of M. xenopi. A patient-centered approach is essential given that M. xenopi is often considered a commensal pathogen. When treatment is required, a multidrug approach with an individualized, optimal duration of therapy should be considered."

The purpose of this paper is to describe a case of prosthetic hip infection and to review the published literature on cases of M. xenopi osteoarticular infections. METHODS: Literature search was performed in the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Central (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 1), LILACS (BIREME) (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database) and Clinical Trials databases (14th August 2018). We included all case reports and case series on adult patients diagnosed with bone or joint infection by M. xenopi for whom the treatment and outcome were specified. RESULTS: We retrieved 30 cases published between 1982 and 2012, among which 25 (83.3%) were reported from Europe. The two most common infection sites were spine (12/30, 40%) and knee (9/30, 30%). Risk factors for infection were previous invasive procedures (11/30, 36.7%), autoimmune disease (8/30, 26.7%), AIDS (4/30, 13.3%) and other comorbidities (2/30, 6.7%); five patients had no past medical history. All patients were treated with antibiotic combinations, but composition and duration of regimens hugely varied. Surgical intervention was performed in 16 patients (53.3%). Only 11 patients obtained full recovery of articular mobility after treatment. CONCLUSION: This work highlights the difficulties in diagnosing and treating M. xenopi osteoarticular infections.

The epidemiology and pathogenicity of NTM species vary geographically. We aimed to outline the clinical relevance and associated radiological patterns of NTM species isolated in Belgium. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre analysis of all patients identified from the laboratory database with > 1 respiratory sample growing NTM from January 2010 through December 2017. We collected clinical, radiological and microbiological data through medical record review and assessed clinical relevance according to ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). RESULTS: Of the 384 unique patients, 60% were male, 56% had a smoking history and 61% had pre-existing lung disease. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. gordonae and M. xenopi were the most frequently isolated species: 53, 15 and 8% respectively. 43% of patients met ATS/IDSA criteria, of whom 28% presented with fibrocavitary disease. Weight loss, fever, nodular bronchiectatic and fibrocavitary lesions on chest CT, and a positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain were significantly associated with NTM-PD. The species with the highest pathogenic potential were M. abscessus (11/12), M. malmoense (6/7) and M. intracellulare (41/64). CONCLUSION: In our study, MAC was the most commonly isolated NTM species, but M. abscessus and M. malmoense showed the highest probability of being clinically relevant. Clinical relevance varied not only by species but also by radiological findings on chest CT and AFB staining. Clinicians should consider these elements in their treatment decision making.

The main reason for treatment halted was drug intolerance. No differences were detected between patients with MAC-LD vs. those with other NTM-LD in terms of unsuccessful outcome in general (35.5% vs. 34.7%). A significantly higher prevalence of patients who underwent treatment halted was found in patients with NTM-LD other than MAC in comparison to patients with MAC-LD (22.4% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.030). One third of adults undergoing treatment for a NTM-LD experiences an unsuccessful outcome with adverse events and treatment discontinuation being major challenges in patients' management."

There is little information regarding outcomes among patients infected with M. xenopi versus other NTM species. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study comparing M. xenopi pulmonary disease (Mx-PD) to M. avium complex (MAC)-PD. Patients were matched by sex, age, radiologic subtype, and presence of cavitation. Baseline clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were compared using matched analyses. We identified 70 Mx-PD cases: 29 fibrocavitary-type, 28 nodular-bronchiectatic-type, and 13 unclassifiable-type CT patterns, mean (SD) age 63 (13) years, and 54.3% (n = 38) female. Median follow-up duration was longer in the Mx-PD cohort (1552 days versus 1035 days, p = 0.01). Symptoms, radiologic phenotype, and pulmonary function were similar between groups although the Charlson Comorbidity Index was numerically higher in Mx-PD patients (3.6 versus 3.2, p = 0.08). Rifamycins were used less frequently in Mx-PD (59.5% versus 85.7%, p = 0.02). Although combined clinical and radiologic improvement was similar between the groups, successful treatment was more common with Mx-PD (40.5% versus 16.7%, p = 0.02) owing to superior culture conversion (70.8% versus 33.3%, p = 0.0001). Mortality 24 months after initiation of treatment was numerically but not statistically greater in the Mx-PD cohort (20.4% versus 10.3%, p = 0.32). Among matched Mx-PD and MAC-PD patients, standard anti-mycobacterial treatment was significantly more likely to achieve culture conversion and successful treatment for Mx-PD patients.

However, a picture of Italian epidemiology and clinical practice is missing. We performed a national Italian survey involving 42 respiratory medicine departments. The NTM species more frequently isolated were Mycobacterium avium complex, followed by M. xenopi and M. kansasii. Patients with NTM were more frequently female (57%), and over 60 years of age, with bronchiectasis and COPD as main comorbidities. Bronchoscopic samples were widely used in the diagnostic phase. Of all patients with NTM, 73% met the criteria for NTM pulmonary disease. Despite strong adherence to the guidelines, physicians found significant difficulties related to pharmacological adverse events, patients' compliance and poor outcomes.

Methods: Forty-five formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens were collected from the Department of Pathology, Beijing Chest Hospital from February 2016 to August 2019. The clinical, imaging and histopathologic features, bacteriologic data and morphologic characteristics of acid fast bacilli (AFB) were analyzed retrospectively. Specific gene sequence IS6110 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was detected by fluorescence PCR. Identification of Mycobacteria was by melting curve method. Fifty cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were selected in the same period as control. Results: The NTM lung cases included 18 cases (40.0%, 18/45) of M. intracellulare, eight cases (17.8%, 8/45) of M. xenopi, six cases (13.3%, 6/45) of M. avium, six cases (13.3%, 6/45) of M. kansasii, six cases (13.3%, 6/45) of M. chelonae and one case (2.2%, 1/45) of M. simiae. Histopathologically, there were necrotizing granulomas in 34 cases (75.6%, 34/45), non-necrotizing granuloma in one case (2.2%, 1/45) and non-granulomatous lesions in 10 cases (22.2%, 10/45). The necrosis was pink necrosis, basophilic necrosis rich in nuclear fragments and suppurative necrosis. Pulmonary TB showed more pink necrosis and basophilic necrosis, the difference was statistically significant (chi(2)=10.270, P=0.001; chi(2)=7.449, P=0.006). Seventeen cases (37.8%, 17/45) of NTM lung disease showed giant multinucleated giant cells, which were significantly different from those in pulmonary tuberculosis group (chi(2)=13.446, P<0.01). The number and morphology of AFB were also different. More AFB were found in M. intracellular cases and significant AFB were easily seen in M. kansasii infection. Conclusions: M. tuberculosis and NTM cannot be reliably differentiated by histologic features or by AFB morphology. Molecular assays are important to distinguish tuberculosis from NTM lung disease."

NON-TUBERCULOUS MYCOBACTERIA (NTM) LUNG DISEASE:  Especially in patients with microscopic detection of acid-fast bacteria in sputum or with cavernous disease manifestation, the start of treatment should not be delayed. Treatment should be based on species-specific resistance testing (according to the CLSI guidelines). In selected patients, adjuvant surgical resection after consultation with an expert is recommended. MAC LUNG DISEASE:  Therapy is based on a regimen with at least three drugs including a macrolide (rather azithromycin than clarithromycin) and ethambutol. For patients with cavitation, with pronounced nodular bronchiectatic disease or with macrolide resistance, daily oral therapy should be expanded by parenteral amikacin or streptomycin. Liposomally encapsulated amikacin for inhalation is recommended in patients with treatment failure. Patients with nodular-bronchiectatic disease manifestation should receive oral macrolide-based therapy, which - depending on the extent - can be given 3 times a week. The recommended duration is 12 months after conversion of the sputum culture. M. KANSASII LUNG DISEASE:  The triple combination of rifampicin, ethambutol and macrolide (or isoniazid) is recommended for at least 12 months. In patients with rifampicin resistance or intolerance, moxifloxacin is recommended as a replacement. M. XENOPI LUNG DISEASE:  The combination of rifampicin, ethambutol and macrolide (and/or moxifloxacin) is recommended for at least 12 months after conversion of the sputum culture. For patients with cavernous disease manifestation, it is recommended to add at least parenteral amikacin and to consult experts. M. ABSCESSUS LUNG DISEASE:  At least 3, in the beginning rather 4 drugs are recommended for therapy. The choice of substance should be based on a in vitro resistance test. Macrolides are the basis, but should not be counted in patients with strains with inducible macrolide resistance. Due to the lack of data, no explicit recommendations are made regarding the duration of therapy; a consultation of experts is recommended."

Clinical features of 25 cases.ABSTRACT:Twenty-five cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) complicated by opportunistic infections were diagnosed at Lenox Hill Hospital during an 18 month period and followed for at least 1 year or until the patients' deaths. Twenty-three patients were homosexual men, including 1 i.v. drug user, and 2 were heterosexual i.v. drug users, including the sole woman. Seventy infections were diagnosed. The commonest etiologic agents included Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. Less frequent pathogens included Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium, JC virus, Mycobacterium xenopi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Seven men also had Kaposi's sarcoma. Prodromal symptoms lasted up to 8 months before the diagnosis of AIDS. Immunologic and serologic evaluation demonstrated lymphopenia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, cutaneous anergy, reversal of the T-cell helper/suppressor ratio, and serologic evidence of previous exposure to CMV, EBV, and HBV. Pneumocystis pneumonia was diagnosed during life in 17 patients, by transbronchial biopsy and bronchoscopic washings, and all 17 cases were successfully treated. However, pneumocystis was more refractory to treatment than previously described and required an average of 29 days of antimicrobial therapy. Disseminated infections with atypical mycobacteria and cytomegalovirus were the leading causes of death. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies often revealed a cellular abnormality (82%) but only occasionally yielded an infectious diagnosis (32%). However, bone marrow examinations were the major means of detecting atypical mycobacteriosis. Colonoscopic biopsies were most useful for establishing the presence of cytomegalovirus colitis. Transbronchial biopsies and bronchial washings gave a high yield of opportunistic pathogens including 34 infectious diagnoses confirmed by 31 procedures. Multiple site biopsies and close communication between the clinician and the pathologist were needed for early diagnosis of opportunistic infections. Twenty-two patients (88%) died, and the few survivors remain debilitated."

DESIGN: Retrospective review of charts and classification of patients based on earlier definitions derived from the American Thoracic Society. SETTING: Tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with a positive isolate of M. xenopi from January 1987 until December 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: During 1993 1996, a significant increase in the number of patients with M. xenopi was found compared with 1987-1992. Of 25 patients, 22 were HIV-seropositive. RESULTS: The HIV-seropositive patients were classified as having definite (n = 5), probable (n = 9) and unlikely disease (n = 8) due to M. xenopi. Symptoms, median CD4 cell count, treatment and outcome did not differ between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: M. xenopi is an emerging pathogen, especially in HIV-infected patients. The criteria of the American Thoracic Society for disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria do not seem applicable to M. xenopi in HIV-infected patients. We suggest that two positive cultures of M. xenopi and no other likely cause of symptoms present should be considered the criteria for diagnosis of M. xenopi disease in HIV-infected patients."

The presence, nature, and distribution of radiographic abnormalities were determined and analyzed in accord with clinical information. In 26 (90%) patients, M. xenopi was the only microorganism that could be isolated. Chest radiographs were normal in 13 patients (45%) and abnormal in 16 patients (55%). Radiographic abnormalities were bilateral in 94% of cases and predominantly involved the lower lobes. Patchy peribronchial opacities (44%) and miliary nodules (24%) were the most common abnormalities. Reticular opacities and parenchymal consolidation were seen in 12% of patients. Pleural effusion was seen in 18% of patients. No patients had cavitations or adenopathy. There was no statistically significant difference regarding the mean age (38.7+/-7.3 years vs. 40.2+/-11.0 years), the duration of clinically evident human immunodeficiency virus infection (2.7+/-1.2 years vs. 2.8+/-1.4 years), and the mean of CD4 cell counts (50.6+/-15.3 cells/ml vs. 47.4+/-15.9 cells/ml) between the patients with and without abnormalities on chest radiographs. In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, pulmonary infection, and simultaneous microbiologic evidence of M. xenopi, chest radiographs can be normal in a substantial number of cases. When radiographic abnormalities are present, they differ from those seen in patient not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who had pulmonary infection caused by M. xenopi and from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pulmonary infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria other than M. xenopi. Although these findings are not specific, they may be of importance in the imaging of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, notably in areas where M. xenopi is endemic."

These patients experienced 136 episodes of Nocardia infection, including pulmonary infection, abscess of deep skin and soft tissue, bacteremia and dissemination, and brain abscess. The 138 Nocardia strains involved 27 species, of which 20 species have been described since 2000. Common species included Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia farcinica, and Nocardia abscessus, together accounting for 59.4%.

However, a Nocardia brain abscess complicated by a middle cerebral artery and infectious intracranial aneurysm is a very rare clinical entity. We present a case of an infectious intracranial aneurysm with an associated Nocardia brain abscess that required surgical intervention and resection.

He was switched to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He finished seven months of antibiotic therapy with a good clinical response. Imaging revealed reduction in the brain abscess and a complete resolution of the lung lesion. Cotrimoxazole was stopped after twelve months of therapy. After two years, the health status of our patient improves day after day. He is however regularly under medical supervision for control exams."

Accurate microbiological data are essential to guide antibiotic treatment. Our primary objective was to describe species identification and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for Nocardia isolates analysed over a 6-year period. Secondary objectives were to study temporal trends in species distribution and AST results. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed results from Nocardia isolates sent between January 2010 and December 2015 to a French laboratory dedicated to Nocardia (Observatoire Francais des Nocardioses). Species identification was obtained by amplification and sequencing of a 600-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene (for all isolates) and of hsp65 (when required). AST was performed using disk diffusion. RESULTS: We included 793 Nocardia isolates, mostly from the lungs (53.8%). The most frequent species were Nocardia farcinica (20.2%), Nocardia abscessus complex (19.9%) and Nocardia nova complex (19.5%). The proportion of N. farcinica increased significantly over time from 13% in 2010 to 27.6% in 2014. Linezolid, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and imipenem were the most frequently identified active antibiotics with, respectively, 0% (0/734), 2.9% (21/730), 5.4% (40/734), 9.4% (69/734) and 19.5% (143/732) of isolates not susceptible. Nocardia farcinica was frequently not susceptible to cefotaxime (118/148, 79.7% of the isolates), but only about 5% of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica and N. abscessus complex isolates were not susceptible to cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: In this first epidemiological study of Nocardia isolated from human samples in France, N. farcinica was the species most frequently identified and its prevalence increased over time."

The polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme analysis (PRA) method and DNA sequence analysis method were utilized to target a gene region that codes the 65-kDa heat-shock protein for typing 150 suspected NTM samples isolated from the respiratory tract. Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium peregrinum were most frequently found by both methods. Six isolates that could not be defined by the PRA method were defined as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia abscessus, and Mycobacterium intracellulare by DNA sequence analysis. Discordance between the results of the two methods was observed for only one isolate. The isolate that was defined as Mycobacterium gordonae type 6 by the PRA method was defined as Mycobacterium senegalense by sequence analysis. The PRA method is simple and gives rapid results. Compared with DNA sequence analysis, it gives consistent and reliable results up to a ratio of 90%. DNA sequence analysis is the gold standard method in which all strains can be defined. However, given our laboratory conditions, its disadvantage is that it takes longer to reach a diagnosis than through the PRA method."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric retrospective analysis of patients presenting with Nocardia-positive biological sample from January 1, 1998 to May 1, 2017. RESULTS: We identified nine cases of Nocardia infections. Risk factors were oral corticosteroid therapy (n=3), solid cancer (n=2), hematological cancer (n=1), COPD (n=1). No risk factor was identified in patients with isolated cutaneous presentation (n=2). Disseminated presentations (n=3) were observed in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (n=2) and presenting with ENT cancer (n=1). Identified Nocardia species were Nocardia nova (n=4), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia abscessus (n=1), Nocardia brasiliensis (n=1), and Nocardia asteroides (n=1). The median diagnostic time was 17 days. Antibiotic therapy was prolonged and included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 6/9 cases. The overall one-year case fatality was high (3/8). No recurrence was observed. We identified two cases of respiratory colonization with N. abscessus and N. cyriacigeorgica in COPD patients. CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis can occur both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. It is a severe infection, with a miscellaneous clinical spectrum and complex treatments. Greater knowledge of nocardiosis is required from physicians for optimal medical care."

","SPECIES:Nocardia asiaticaID:19593231TITLE:Nocardiosis at the turn of the century.ABSTRACT:Nocardia species is an uncommon pathogen that affects both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. The clinical and microbiologic spectrum of nocardiosis has changed recently due to the widespread use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, the emergence of new types of immunosuppressed patients, and the improved identification of isolates using molecular techniques. Nocardia asteroides was traditionally considered the predominant organism, and prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole was considered almost universally protective. We conducted the current study to determine the incidence of nocardiosis and its microbiologic and clinical characteristics in a general hospital over the last 12 years. We reviewed the clinical records of all patients in whom Nocardia species was isolated from clinical specimens between 1995 and 2006. Nocardia isolates were identified by standard procedures and by 5' end 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Susceptibility to cotrimoxazole, minocycline, imipenem, linezolid, and amikacin was determined by the broth microdilution method following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.The incidence of Nocardia infections did not increase significantly during the study period (0.39/100,000 inhabitants in 1995-1998 and 0.55/100,000 inhabitants in 2003-2006). Nocardia was recovered from 43 patients. Six were considered to be colonized. The colonizing species were N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. asteroides. All colonized patients had severe underlying pulmonary conditions and were treated with antimicrobials (6 patients) or corticosteroids (4 patients). Invasive nocardiosis was diagnosed in 37 patients (86.5% were men, and their mean age was 55.8 +/- 17.3 yr). The most common underlying condition in our institution was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (10 patients; 27%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8 patients; 21.6%), autoimmune diseases (8 patients; 21.6%), solid organ transplantation (7 patients; 18.9%), and cancer (4 patients; 10.8%). The most important risk factor for nocardiosis was corticosteroid administration (23 patients; 62.2%). Nocardiosis affected the lungs in 26 cases (70.3%), the skin in 3 cases (8.1%), and the central nervous system in 2 cases (5.4%). It was disseminated in 5 cases (13.5%) and caused otomastoiditis in 1 (2.7%). The species identified were N. cyriacigeorgica (32.4%), N. farcinica (24.3%), N. otitidiscaviarum (10.8%), N. veterana (8.1%), N. nova (5.4%), N. abscessus (5.4%), N. asiatica (2.7%), N. beijingensis (2.7%), N. brasiliensis (2.7%), N. carnea (2.7%), and Nocardia species (2.7%).Linezolid and amikacin were uniformly active against all the isolates, whereas 29.7% of isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to minocycline (minimum inhibitory concentration = 2 mg/L), 10.8% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, and 5.4% were resistant to imipenem. Nocardiosis occurred while the patients were on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 8 cases (21.6%). The strains isolated from these patients were susceptible to cotrimoxazole in 5 cases (62.5%) and resistant in 3 (37.5%). Overall, 13 patients died (35.1%); related mortality was 21.6% (8 patients). We conclude that HIV infection has become the most common underlying condition for invasive nocardiosis in our institution, followed by chronic lung disease. Previous use of corticosteroids was the main risk factor and was present in more than half the patients. New species of Nocardia have been identified, and administration of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should no longer be considered highly reliable protection against nocardiosis. Larger studies of nocardiosis are required to better identify risk factors associated with mortality, and alternative and more effective methods of prevention must be developed."

From 2003 to 2008, four nocardioform strains (W8027, W8681, W9071 and W9241(T)) were isolated from patients in the state of Florida, USA. Ribosomal gene sequencing analysis suggested that a novel species of the genus Nocardia had been isolated. These strains were subjected to a taxonomic analysis using a polyphasic approach. Phenotypic analyses included morphological examination, biochemical profiling and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Molecular studies included 16S rRNA and DNA gyrase B subunit (gyrB) gene sequence analyses and DNA-DNA hybridization. Phylogenetic neighbours were determined through 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequence analyses. Phenotypic characteristics that differentiated the novel isolates from phylogenetically related species were growth at 45  C, and three of the four novel strains utilized l-rhamnose. The antimicrobial profiles could not reliably distinguish the novel species from related nocardiae. Analysis showed that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the four novel isolates were identical. The blast analysis of the near full-length 16S rRNA gene showed 99.2 % sequence similarity to Nocardia araoensis DSM 44729(T), Nocardia arthritidis DSM 44731(T) and Nocardia beijingensis JCM 10666(T), 98.7 % to Nocardia amamiensis DSM 45066(T), 98.2 % to Nocardia pneumoniae JCM 12119(T) and 97.8 % to Nocardia takedensis JCM 13313(T). Analysis of partial gyrB gene sequences showed that the novel isolates had 95.4 % similarity to N. arthritidis DSM 44731(T), 95.3 % to Nocardia gamkensis DSM 44956(T), 94.4 % to N. pneumoniae JCM 12119(T), 93.8 % to Nocardia asiatica DSM 44668(T), 93.5 % to N. amamiensis DSM 45066(T), 93.4 % to N. beijingensis JCM 10666(T) and 93.2 % to N. araoensis DSM 44729(T). The DNA-DNA relatedness values between the four novel strains were 86-89 %; the relatedness value for strain W9241(T) compared with N. beijingensis JCM 10666(T) was 47 % and 46 % with N. araoensis DSM 44729(T), 44 % with N. arthritidis DSM 44731(T), 32 % with N. amamiensis DSM 45066(T) and 20 % with N. asiatica DSM 44668(T). The results of the taxonomic analysis suggested that the new isolates represent a novel species of the genus Nocardia for which the name Nocardia niwae sp. nov. is proposed.

Patients with nocardiosis in four large medical centers from 1998 to 2010 were included. A total of 100 preserved nonduplicate isolates causing human infection were identified as Nocardia species. Sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA confirmed that 35 of 36 N. asteroides isolates identified by conventional tests were non-asteroides Nocardia species, and that two of 50 N. brasiliensis isolates had also been initially misidentified. N. brasiliensis (50%) was the most common pathogen, followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (18%). In addition, several rare pathogens were identified, including N. asiatica, N. rhamnosiphila, N. abscessus, N. transvalensis, N. elegans, and N. carnea. Primary cutaneous infection was the most common presentation, noted in 55 (55%) patients, while pulmonary infection presented in 26 (26%) patients. The crude mortality rate was 6.7% (6/89), and was lowest for primary cutaneous infection (2.2%) and highest for disseminated disease and pulmonary infection (16.7%). In conclusion, N. brasiliensis and N. cyriacigeorgica were the most common pathogens causing nocardiosis in Taiwan. Molecular methods for identifying Nocardia to the species level are mandatory for better understanding the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of patients with nocardiosis."

The incidence of nocardiosis varies geographically according to several factors, such as the prevalence of HIV infections, transplants, neoplastic and rheumatic diseases, as well as climate, socio-economic conditions and laboratory procedures for Nocardia detection and identification. In Brazil the paucity of clinical reports of Nocardia infections suggests that this genus may be underestimated as a cause of human diseases and/or either neglected or misidentified in laboratory specimens. Accurate identification of Nocardia species has become increasingly important for clinical and epidemiological investigations. In this study, seven clinical Nocardia isolates were identified by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and their antimicrobial susceptibility was also determined. Most Nocardia isolates were associated to pulmonary disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of Brazilian human isolates in cases reported in literature were identified as Nocardia sp. Molecular characterization was used for species identification of Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia asiatica and Nocardia exalbida/gamkensis. Data indicated that molecular analysis provided a different Nocardia speciation than the initial biochemical identification for most Brazilian isolates. All Nocardia isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobial of choice in the treatment nocardiosis. N. nova isolated from different clinical specimens from one patient showed identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and two distinct clones. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country in terms of land mass and population, pulmonary, extrapulmonary and systemic forms of nocardiosis were reported in only 6 of the 26 Brazilian states from 1970 to 2013. A least 33.8% of these 46 cases of nocardiosis proved fatal. Interestingly, coinfection by two clones may occur in patients presenting nocardiosis. Nocardia infection may be more common throughout the Brazilian territory and in other developing tropical countries than is currently recognized and MLSA should be used more extensively as an effective method for Nocardia identification."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. DISCUSSION: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections. Nocardiosis manifests various clinical features depending on the Nocardia species and underlying conditions."

Polymicrobial infection was found in 17 patients (85%) and unimicrobial in 3 (15%). Seventeen patients (85%) had bacterial organisms, 10 of whom had other pathogens as well. Mycobacteria were isolated in 8 patients (40%), fungi in 3 (15%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 3 (15%), and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in 1 (5%). Mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy and additional noncavitary ill-defined nodular opacities were found more frequently in patients with mycobacterial pathogens. Mean CD4 count in patients with cavitary disease because of bacterial pathogens alone was significantly higher than in patients with nonbacterial pathogens (alone or combined with bacterial pathogens) (203 vs. 42, p &lt; 0.05). Four patients expired during the diagnostic hospital admission; 2 of them had pulmonary cavitary disease associated with Nocardia asteroides. Cavitary lung disease in patients with AIDS undergoing chest CT should be assumed infectious and is generally polymicrobial."

","SPECIES:Nocardia asteroides ID:11897524TITLE:Nocardia infection in lung transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Nocardia is responsible for infection in both normal and immunocompromised hosts. Organ transplant recipients are increasingly recognized as a sub-group of immunocompromised patients in whom nocardia is an important pathogen. The frequency of nocardia in organ transplant recipients varies between 0.7% and 3%. Nocardia infection has largely been reported in heart, kidney and liver transplant recipients. Presentations of nocardia in lung transplant recipients have been restricted primarily to case reports. The present study reviews the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of nocardia infection in lung transplant recipients at our institution. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 473 lung transplant recipients from January 1991 to November 2000 was done at a university hospital. Patient demographics, immunosuppressive regimen at the time of isolation of nocardia species, use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis, rejection episodes in the preceding 6 months, concurrent pathogens, site of infection, radiologic findings and treatment and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Nocardia infection was found in 2.1% (10 of 473) of our lung transplant recipients. Median time of onset was 34.1 months after transplantation. Nocardia species included N farcinica in 30% (3 of 10), N nova in 30% (3 of 10), N asteroides complex in 30% (3 of 10) and N brasiliensis in 10% (1 of 10) of patients. Post-transplant diabetes was present in 50% (5 of 10) of patients. The primary indication for lung transplantation was emphysema in 40% (4 of 10). Native lung involvement was noted in 75% (3 of 4) of patients with single lung transplant. Breakthrough nocardia infection were noted in 6 patients who were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for P carinii pneumonia; all breakthrough isolates remained susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Overall mortality was 40% (4 of 10). All patients (3 of 3) with infection due to N farcinica, except 1 (1 of 7) with infection due to other nocardia species, died. Seventy-five percent (3 of 4) of deaths were attributable to nocardia infection. CONCLUSIONS: Nocardia infection tended to involve the native lung in single lung transplant recipients. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for P carinii prophylaxis at the doses given was not protective against nocardiosis in these patients. Infection with N farcinica was associated with poor outcome. Thus, species identification and extended courses of antibiotics based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing are important in management of these patients."

Mostly, the patients had been infected as a consequence of impaired immunity. In some cases, bioterrorist activities may also induce pneumonia by gram positive rods (B. anthracis). In order to bring these organisms to the attention of the medical community, we present three clinical cases and describe six species of gram positive rods, known to provoke this kind of pneumonias. Case 1 was a 84 years old patient with impaired lung function. He was suspicious of tuberculosis (Tbc). Nocardia spec. was isolated. Case 2 was an alcoholic of 46 years with pneumonia. Reactivation of Tbc was suspected. Actinomadura madurae has been isolated. Case 3 was a patient of 58 years with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and pneumonia. N. asteroides was isolated. All patients shared impaired immunity (age, alcoholism, MDS) with impaired lung functions; Tbc had been suspected (Case 1 + 2). Infection by A. madurae was contained by Clindamycin. Therapy of Nocardia with Moxifloxacin (Case 1) or Bactrim (Case 3) was only partly effective. In the appendix, six species of gram positive rods which are known to cause pneumonia, are summarized (Nocardia, Actinomyceta, Actinomadura, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Bacillus)."

Ultimately, Nocardia asteroides was cultured from the wound and complete cure was achieved after 8 months' treatment with co-trimoxazole. Infections with Nocardia spp. are rare but may occur more often and run a more fulminant course in patients under treatment with immunosuppressants. Cutaneous nocardiosis generally has a characteristic lymphogenous spreading pattern, but an atypical picture with pustules, pyoderma, cellulitis or abscess formation is also possible. In non-cutaneous nocardiosis there is usually pneumonia or lung abscess, possibly with secondary haematogenous spread to the central nervous system or skin. Culturing Nocardia requires more time than usual but can be promoted by special culture media. Treatment of the infection with co-trimoxazole is the method of choice and is almost always successful in cases of cutaneous nocardiosis."

Of 1510 sputum samples cultured from 1016 patients, 67 sputa originating from 16 patients were found to be positive for the Nocardia asteroides species complex. Based upon repeated isolation of N. asteroides from the respiratory tract, its microscopic demonstration in KOH wet mounts or stained smears of sputum and clinical evaluation of patients, 14 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis were diagnosed. This gave a prevalence of 1.4% pulmonary nocardiosis in the tuberculosis hospital. The prevalence of the disease was found to be 1.3% in the males as against 1.5% in the females. Of the various clinical categories of patients investigated, pulmonary tuberculosis with sputum negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) yielded the highest prevalence of 3.2%, followed by 1.3%, 1.2%, 1.1% and 0.5% in pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis and pulmonary tuberculosis with sputum positive for AFB, respectively. Type IV cutaneous hypersensitivity to nocardin was observed in 19 of 908 (2%) patients tested, whereas only a solitary positive reactor was found among 260 healthy volunteers. Twelve of 19 nocardin positive reactors (63%) had unequivocally proven pulmonary nocardiosis. The nocardin skin test gave false negative results in two nocardiosis patients. More comprehensive investigations are warranted in order to evaluate the nocardin skin test as an additional aid for the diagnosis of nocardiosis. Barring a solitary exception, the nocardiosis patients were successfully treated with sulphadiazine or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) combination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of pulmonary nocardiosis patients in a prospective study as yet reported from India. The observations underscore the point that nocardiosis warrants greater attention in the differential diagnosis of bronchopulmonary diseases."

An uncommon association?].ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: Nocardiosis is difficult to diagnose and infrequently associated with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. This study analyzes the clinical and microbiological characteristics of 40 patients in whom microorganisms belonging to the Nocardia asteroides complex were isolated. METHODS: We studied 27 males and 13 females, with a mean age of 45 years (8-82). Nocardia spp. were isolated in 129 samples. Cultures were performed with conventional methods; additionally, when branching Gram-positive bacilli were visualized on microscopic examination, modified BCYE-alpha (m) medium was used. RESULTS: In 77.5% of the cases, investigation for Nocardia spp. was based on microscopy findings, in six patients it was a fortuitous finding in BCYE-alpha (m) medium, and in only three patients nocardiosis was clinically suspected. Twenty-five patients had nocardiosis (5 disseminated infection and 20 lung infection) and the remaining 15 were colonized. The most frequent risk factor in the infections, whether disseminated or not, was systemic glucocorticoid use (P 5 .001). The most frequent underlying pathology was bronchiectasis (80%), associated or not with cystic fibrosis. There were seven deaths and two patients had neurological sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchiectasis was an important risk factor for colonization by Nocardia spp. (P 5 0.01) in all the patients studied, and for infection (P 5 0.05) in patients without cystic fibrosis.

METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study (1:2 ratio) between January 1995 and December 2005. Control subjects were matched for transplant type and timing. Univariate matched odds ratios were determined and conditional logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of all case patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Among 5126 organ transplant recipients, 35 (0.6%) were identified as having cases of Nocardia infection. The highest frequency was among recipients of lung transplants (18 [3.5%] of 521 patients), followed by recipients of heart (10 [2.5%] of 392), intestinal (2 [1.3%] of 155), kidney (3 [0.2%] of 1717), and liver (2 [0.1%] of 1840) transplants. In a comparison of case patients with 70 matched control subjects, receipt of high-dose steroids (odds ratio, 27; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-235; P=.003) and cytomegalovirus disease (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-46; P=.047) in the preceding 6 months and a high median calcineurin inhibitor level in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-22; P=.012) were found to be independent risk factors for Nocardia infection. The majority of case patients (27 [77%] of 35) had pulmonary disease only. Seven transplant recipients (20%) had disseminated disease. Nocardia nova was the most common species (found in 17 [49%] of the patients), followed by Nocardia farcinica (9 [28%]), Nocardia asteroides (8 [23%]), and Nocardia brasiliensis (1 [3%]). Of the 35 case patients, 24 (69%) were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis.

Microbiological, biochemical, cytological and scanning electron microscopy methods were used in diagnosis. Nocardia asteroides type IV, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum,Nocardia nova (type III) and Nocardia farcinica (type V) were isolated from bovine milk, bronchial lavage and/or cutaneous-subcutaneous abscesses in dogs. Nocardial bovine mastitis was diagnosed predominantly in clinical cases, in dairy herds with poor environmental hygienic conditions between milking and inappropriate intramammary therapy. Canine nocardiosis was observed commonly in animals co-infected with distemper virus. Sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (92.8%), amikacin (92.8%) and ceftiofur (92.8%) were the most effective drugs in 28 isolates. Multiple drug resistance to three or more and five or more antimicrobials was observed in ten (35.7%) and three (10.7%) strains, respectively, predominantly with use of cloxaxillin, cefoperazone and ampicillin.

METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of a series of 22 patients (17 men) with Nocardia infection seen between 1997 and 2008. RESULTS: Mean age was 63.2+/-19.2 years. The most common clinical forms observed were lower respiratory tract infection (15/22, 68%, 8 bronchitis and 7 pneumonia) mainly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10/22, 45%), and skin involvement (4/22, 19%). Seven different Nocardia species were recovered, the most common being N. asteroides (n=6), N. abscessus (n=4), and N. cyriacigeorgica (n=4). Sensitivity studies, available in 16/22 patients, showed that all Nocardia were sensitive to cotrimoxazole. N. cyriacigeorgica caused respiratory infections (2 bronchitis and 2 pneumonia) with a mortality rate of 50%. CONCLUSION: The most common clinical form of Nocardia infection is a lower respiratory tract infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

METHODS: The clinical and radiological data of 2 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis in this hospital were presented, and 32 cases reported in the Chinese literature since 1982 were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the 34 cases of Nocardia infections, there were 26 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis, and 4 of whom died. Multiple organ infection occurred in 11 patients, including 7 with pulmonary and skin infections, 3 with pulmonary, skin and intracranial infections, and 1 with pulmonary and intracranial infections. All patients with pulmonary nocardiosis had cough. Of the 34 cases, 27 had fever, including intermittent fever in 5, and sustained fever in 22 cases. Of the 11 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis complicated with skin or intracranial dissemination, 8 patients were immunocompromised and 3 were immunocompetent (chi(2) = 2.08, P &gt; 0.05). Three cases died in the immunocompromised group and 1 died in the immunocompetent group. Nocardia asteroides was identified in 14 cases, Nocardia brasiliensis in 4 cases, and the other 8 were not classified. In the patients with complicated skin or intracranial infections, 8 were caused by Nocardia asteroids, and 2 were caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. Chest X-ray or CT imaging of the lungs showed pleural effusion in 8, masses in 7, infiltrates in 6, cavities in 6, and nodular lesions in 5 cases. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that Nocardia was sensitive to sulfonamide, amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, minocycline, fluoroquinolones, and linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression is the most important predisposing factor for pulmonary nocardiosis. The most common pathogenic bacterium is Nocardia asteroids, which is frequently associated with disseminated lesions. The radiographic abnormalities of the lung show pleural effusion, masses, infiltration or cavity. With the increasing rate of resistance of Nocardia to the sulfonamide, the combination of antibiotic regimen according to susceptibility testing needs to be considered. Poor outcome is mostly found in immunocompromised hosts."

We report a case of a patient with CF harbouring Nocardia farcinica. An 18-year-old male diagnosed with CF at the age of eight (F508 del/G85E) had been treated for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in 1998 with itraconazole, and a first colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was eradicated in 2003. From May 2006, he presented with recurrent left- and right-sided pneumothorax. In June 2006, he presented with dyspnoea, fever, and nodular eruption on his ankles. Chest X-ray and CT scan revealed a right pneumothorax, severe bronchiectasis and bilateral alveolar consolidation. N. farcinica was idolated from his sputum without any other pathogens. Treatment with intravenous cotrimoxazole associated with imipenem and amikacin was initiated for three weeks followed by oral cotrimoxazole for a further nine months. The patient's symptoms and alveolar consolidation on CT scan improved. During 2007, his respiratory condition worsened and his FEV(1) declined from 50 to 26 % predicted. His pneumothorax recurred. He had chronic colonization with P. aeruginosa and was on the list for lung transplantation. Nocardia, a Gram positive bacillus, causes mainly pulmonary infection, usually in the context of immune suppression. The most frequent species is N. asteroides. In CF, very few cases have been reported; almost always N. asteroides, but exceptionally N. farcinica.

A periodic chest X-ray examination in July, 2010, incidentally revealed nodular densities and associated cavities in the upper right lung field. On thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT), bilateral pulmonary nodular shadows with various-sized cavities and multiple, new, intrahepatic, low-density regions were also identified. On bronchoscopy, a white, excavated lesion resembling an ulcerous lesion was observed in the left upper lobe bronchus, and a small exophytic lesion was observed in the right B6 bronchus.

Cutaneous-subcutaneous, pulmonary and systemic signs are observed in feline nocardiosis. However, osteomyelitis is a rare clinical manifestation in cats. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly N. asteroides sensu stricto), Nocardia brasiliensis, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia nova are the most common pathogenic species identified in cats, based on recent molecular classification (16S rRNA gene). The present report is, to our knowledge, the first case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a cat caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of methods, including molecular techniques. CASE PRESENTATION: A one-year-old non-neutered female cat, raised in a rural area, was admitted to the Companion Animal Hospital-PUCPR, Sao Jose dos Pinhais, State of Parana, Brazil, with a history a progressive facial lesion, difficulty apprehending food, loss of appetite, apathy and emaciation. Clinical examination showed fever, submandibular lymphadenitis, and a painless, 8 cm diameter mass, which was irregularly-shaped, of firm consistency, and located in the region of the left mandible. The skin around the lesion was friable, with diffuse inflammation (cellulitis), multiple draining sinuses, and exudation of serosanguinous material containing whitish ""sulfur"" granules.Diagnosis was based initially in clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological, and histopathological findings, and radiographic images.

Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were promptly given along with systemic vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and meropenem. Vision improved rapidly to 20/40 with stabilization and eventual scarring of the lesion. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that rapid diagnosis and treatment of subretinal N. asteroides can possibly have a good visual outcome and stabilization of the ocular manifestations."

Since the clinical pictures and antimicrobial susceptibilities of Nocardia species exhibit variability, susceptibility testing is recommended for every Nocardia isolates. The aims of this study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Nocardia clinical isolates and to compare the results of broth microdilution and disc diffusion susceptibility tests. A total of 45 clinical Nocardia isolates (isolated from 17 respiratory tract, 8 brain abscess, 7 pus, 3 skin, 3 conjunctiva, 2 blood, 2 tissue, 2 pleural fluid and 1 cerebrospinal fluid samples) were identified by using conventional methods and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Susceptibility testing was performed for amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, linezolid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria recommended in 2011 approved standard (M24-A2) and disk diffusion method used as an alternative comparative susceptibility testing method. Among the 45 Nocardia strains, N.cyriacigeorgica (n: 26, 57.8%) was the most common species, followed by N.farcinica (n: 12, 26.7%), N.otitiscaviarum (n: 4, 8.9%), N.asteroides (n: 1, 2.2%), N.neocaledoniensis (n: 1, 2.2%) and N.abscessus (n: 1, 2.2%). Amikacin and linezolid were the only two antimicrobials to which all isolates were susceptible for both broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests. In broth microdilution test, resistance rates to TMP-SMX, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were found as 15.6%, 37.8% and 84.4% respectively, whereas in the disk diffusion test, the highest resistance rate was observed against ciprofloxacin (n: 33, 73.3%), followed by TMP-SMX (n: 22, 48.9%) and ceftriaxone (n: 15, 33.3%). In both of these tests, N.cyriacigeorgica was the species with the highest resistance to ciprofloxacin (n: 25, 96.2%). When the susceptibility test results were compared, amikacin (kappa= 1), linezolid (kappa= 1), and ceftriaxone (kappa= 0.903) showed very good agreement, whereas ciprofloxacin showed good agreement (kappa= 0.672). For TMP-SMX no agreement was found between the two test methods (kappa= 0.092). In conclusion, due to the identification of different species with molecular methods and increased frequency of Nocardia infections in recent years, in vitro susceptibility testing for Nocardia species is important to guide the appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

We aimed to characterize the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical features of nocardiosis in the tropical north of Australia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of nocardiosis diagnosed between 1997 and 2014. Population-based incidences were calculated using district population data. RESULTS: Clinically significant nocardiosis was identified in 61 patients. The unadjusted population-based annual incidence of nocardiosis was 2.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-2.60) per 100000 people and was 1.7 (95% CI, .96-2.90) fold higher in Indigenous compared with non-Indigenous persons (P = .027). Of 61 patients, 47 (77%) had chronic lung disease, diabetes, and/or hazardous alcohol consumption; 22 (36%) were immunocompromised; and 8 (13%) had no identified comorbidities. Disease presentations included pulmonary (69%; 42 of 61), cutaneous (13%; 8 of 61), and disseminated nocardiosis (15%; 9 of 61). The most commonly identified species were Nocardia asteroides and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (each 11%). Linezolid was the only antimicrobial to which isolates were universally susceptible; 89% (48 of 54), 60% (32 of 53), and 48% (26 of 54) of isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and imipenem, respectively. Eighteen patients (30%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 1-year mortality was 31%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nocardiosis in tropical Australia is amongst the highest reported globally. Nocardiosis occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, and it is associated with high rates of ICU admission, 1-year mortality, and resistance to commonly recommended antimicrobials. Diagnosis should be considered in patients with consistent clinical features, particularly if they are Indigenous or have chronic lung disease."

In Tanzania, where tuberculosis is one of the major public health threat clinical impact of nocardiosis as the cause of the human disease remains unknown. The objective of the present study was to isolate and identify Nocardia isolates recovered from TB suspects in Northeastern, Tanzania by using biochemical and molecular methods. METHODS: The study involved 744 sputum samples collected from 372 TB suspects from four periphery diagnostic centers in Northeastern, Tanzania. Twenty patients were diagnosed as having presumptively Nocardia infections based on microscopic, cultural characteristics and biomerieux ID 32C Yeast Identification system and confirmed using 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene specific primers for Nocardia species and sequencing. RESULTS: Biochemically, the majority of the isolates were N. asteroides (n = 8/20, 40%), N. brasiliensis (n = 4/20, 20%), N. farcinica (n = 3/20, 15%), N. nova (n = 1/20, 5%). Other aerobic actinomycetales included Streptomyces cyanescens (n = 2/20, 10%), Streptomyces griseus, Actinomadura madurae each (n = 1/20, 5%). Results of 16S rRNA and hsp65 sequencing were concordant in 15/17 (88. 2%) isolates and discordant in 2/17 (11.8%) isolates. Majority of the isolates belonged to N. cyriacigeorgica and N. farcinica, four (23.5%) each. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Nocardia species may be an important cause of pulmonary nocardiosis that is underdiagnosed or ignored. This underscores needs to consider pulmonary nocardiosis as a differential diagnosis when there is a failure of anti-TB therapy and as a possible cause of human infections."

The pericardial fluid was examined several times before it eventually revealed filamentous branching organisms in Gram and modified acid-fast bacilli stain. The culture grew Nocardia spp. and was identified by 16s rRNA sequencing as N. beijingensis. Eight previously reported cases of Nocardia pericarditis in HIV-infected patients were caused by Nocardia asteroides. All patients had low CD4 cell count (range: 17-239 cells/mm3) and 50% of patients were treated for tuberculous pericarditis prior to making the correct diagnosis of Nocardia pericarditis. This report revisits the issue of nocardiosis as a great TB mimicker.

Recently, the widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and antitumor drugs has led to an increasing number of Nocardiainfections being reported. However, it  is  difficult  to  confirm  this  diagnosis  owing  to  the  slow  growth  of  the  bacterium  and  its  complex  resultant  clinical  manifestations,  potentially delaying treatment and increasing mortality. Thus, further knowledge on the clinical characteristics of Nocardiainfection is  required.  Hence,  this  study  aimed  to  review  the  demographics,  comorbidities,  clinical  presentation,  microbiology,  treatment,  and  outcomes of Nocardiainfections in Yantai.Materials  and  methods:This  is  a  retrospective  study  including  32  patients  identified  to  have  Nocardiainfection  from  the  Yantai  Yuhuangding Hospital.

Case presentation: Herein, we describe a case of primary cutaneous nocardiosis in a renal transplant recipient; treated with anti-tubercular drugs due to misdiagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis. On clinical examinations, a few red erythematous papules with erosions and crusting seen, over prior surgery scar of renal transplant. Multiple basophilic colonies surrounded by neutrophilic abscesses and granulation tissue were seen on histopathological examinations. The presumptive identification was done by Ziehl-neelson staining, bacterial culture, biochemical interpretations, and susceptibility pattern of the isolates to antibiotics. Radiographic imaging of brain and lungs were normal; no feature of disseminated nocardiosis seen. After 3 months of an anti-microbial therapy i.e. TMP-SMX(sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim); the patient underwent progressive changes no relapse noted; transplant function observed in a good state, found asymptomatic with limited side effects on a regular follow up till now.

Most of our knowledge on PN is derived from case reports and small case series. Increasing incidence rates of PN have been reported recently. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course of and risk factors for PN in four Western European countries and to estimate population-based annual hospitalization rates. METHODS: This was a retrospective evaluation (1995-2011) of the clinical course of and risk factors for PN in patients at 11 hospitals in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands). Population-based estimates of hospitalization rates for PN in Germany (2005 to 2011) were calculated using official German nationwide diagnosis-related groups (DRG) hospital statistics. RESULTS: Forty-three patients fulfilled stringent criteria for proven (n=8) and probable (n=35) PN; seven had extrapulmonary dissemination. For these 43 patients, the major risk factors for PN were immunocompromising (83.7%) and/or pulmonary (58.1%; as only comorbidity in 27.9%) comorbidities. The median duration of PN targeted therapy was 12 weeks. Distinctive patterns of resistance were observed (imipenem susceptibility: Nocardia farcinica 33.3%; Nocardia asteroides 66.7%). The overall mortality rate was 18.9% (50% in disseminated PN). Over time, annual PN hospitalization rates remained unchanged at around 0.04/100000, with the highest rate among men aged 75-84 years (0.24/100000).

A review of 401 consecutive renal transplants revealed 26 cases (18 suspected and 8 histologically proved) of PC infection in 21 cadaver and 5 living-related renal recipients. The diagnosis was confirmed in 8/18 patients who were invasively studied by open-lung biopsy (1/2), bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy (4/9), bronchoscopy with brushing (1/2), bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (2/5), and transpleural needle biopsy (0/1)-yielding a confirmed incidence of 2% (8/401). All positive invasive studies had been performed prior to or within 24 hr of the inception of TMP-SMX therapy. Nine of ten negative invasive studies were performed after more than 24 hr of treatment. The mean time from transplantation to the onset of clinical symptoms was 2.5 +/- 1.5 months. The infection rate would be 6.5%, assuming all 18 suspected cases would be PC-positive if studied pretreatment. In order to assess the efficacy of a variety of serologic methods of PC detection, qualitative counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for P carinii antigen (PC-Ag), IgG antibody reactive with PC (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]), and a latex particle agglutination test (LPA) were performed on 279 sera; 85 sera from the 26 suspected or proved cases, 100 sera from normal age-matched controls, and 94 sera from 78 asymptomatic allograft recipients followed as outpatients. In the eight histologically proven cases, CIE was positive in only 3/8 and turned positive late in the clinical course. LPA was positive in all histologically proved cases; however, it was also positive in 60% of asymptomatic renal recipients. In cases that developed clinical disease, LPA increased in titer weeks to months prior to the onset of symptoms. Additionally, LPA titers decreased or stabilized during successful TMP-SMX therapy, providing an early therapeutic index. Measurement of anti-PC IgG was not useful per se, as it was elevated in both controls and documented PC infection. The combination of very low antibody titer (less than or equal to 1:16) with a positive or increasing LPA PC-Ag titer appeared to be disease-predictive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

He was not neutropenic and gave no history of cutaneous inoculation or trauma. He developed an abscess on the plantar surface of his right big toe from which Nocardia asteroides was isolated. He was successfully treated with a combination of TMP/SMX and minocycline. Despite prolonged immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD, the infection responded and did not recur. TMP/SMX prophylaxis for PCP in BMT recipients with GVHD does not always prevent nocardial infection but may prevent or delay the development of dissemination."

She had dysarthria, mild right-sided motor hemiparesis and central paresis affecting the 7th cranial nerve. An area of fluctuating resistance, about 3 cm in diameter, was noticed over the left thigh. Serology indicated inflammatory disease, but there was no immunodeficiency. The CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with mild protein increase but no evidence of infective agent. As tubercular meningitis was suspected she was treated with rifampicin (300 mg i.v. twice daily), isoniazid (300 mg i.v. once daily), streptomycin (800 mg i.m. once daily), cefotaxime (2.0 g i.v. three times daily), fluconazole (200 mg i.v. once daily) and dexamethasone (16-8-8 mg i.v.). She suddenly died two days after admission, probably as the result of central regulatory failure. Generalized nocardiosis involving lung, subcutaneous tissue and brain was revealed at autopsy.

DESIGN: Retrospective. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 222 patients with AIDS hospitalized between January 1986 and January 1992 at the Medical University of South Carolina hospitals. RESULTS: Pleural effusions occurred in 59 patients for an overall incidence of 27%. The mean age of the patients was 35 +/- 2 years (SE) and the male to female ratio was 5:1. The cause was infectious in 39 (66%) patients, noninfectious in 18 (31%), and unknown in 2 (3%). Pleural effusions were caused by bacterial pneumonia in 18 (31%) patients, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in 9 (15%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 5 (8%), septic embolism in 2 (3%), Nocardia asteroides in 2 (3%), cryptococcus neoformans in 2 (3%), and Mycobacterium arium intracellulare in 1 (2%). Among noninfectious causes (n = 18), hypoalbuminemia was the cause in 11 patients (19%), cardiac failure in 3 (5%), and atelectasis, Kaposi sarcoma, uremic pleurisy, and adult respiratory distress syndrome in 1 (2%) each. Patients with AIDS who had pleural effusions had significantly lower serum albumin levels and had lower CD4 counts than did those without pleural effusions (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusions are common in hospitalized patients with AIDS. Bacterial pneumonia is the most common cause for pleural effusion in AIDS. Large effusions are associated with Kaposi sarcoma and tuberculosis. Hypoalbuminemia is a common cause of noninfectious pleural effusions."

In patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cavitation is an uncommon manifestation of a common disease. It is unusual in patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis but occurs frequently in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, cavities are more common during earlier stages of HIV disease, when cellular immunity is relatively preserved. Mycobacterium avium complex is an uncommon cause of lung disease and infrequently produces cavities. However, Mycobacterium kansasii, is often associated with cavitation. Cavities can complicate any bacterial pneumonia and are especially common with pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia asteroides, and Rhodococcus equi. Noninfectious causes of cavitary lesions are rare, but cavitary lesions caused by pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been reported. Because of the broad differential diagnosis and because most cavities are caused by treatable opportunistic infections, a definitive diagnosis is essential."

Knowledge of how these counts correlate with radiographic appearances of these entities can limit the differential diagnosis because certain conditions are uncommon above a specific count. In patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts above 200 cells/mm3 and radiographic findings of cavitary and noncavitary consolidation, bacterial pneumonia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are the major diagnostic considerations. As the CD4 lymphocyte count falls, these infections are still common; however, cavitation is seen less frequently with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and unusual bacterial infections, including those caused by Rhodococcus equi and Nocardia asteroides, should be considered. In patients with counts below 200 cells/mm3, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the most common infection, usually manifesting radiographically as a reticular interstitial pattern. At CD4 lymphocyte counts of 50-200 cells/mm3, disseminated fungal infection and Kaposi sarcoma become prevalent. In patients with advanced AIDS and counts below 50 cells/mm3, radiographic nodular or reticular patterns may indicate AIDS-related lymphoma and cytomegalovirus and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. When CD4 lymphocyte counts are applied to interpretation of chest radiographs in AIDS patients, the working differential diagnosis of a radiographic pattern can be tailored to the clinical situation of a given patient."

Nocardia asteroides is the predominant human pathogen. Nocardiosis is difficult to diagnose and that's why its incidence is not well established. CASES: Three cases diagnosed in a Pneumology Section are reported. None of them was affected by AIDS and all of them were initially diagnosed from bronchopneumonia. Empirical antibiotherapy was initiated and because of the unsatisfactory progress, bronchoscopy was performed in all cases and in one case a transthoracic puncture was made. Nocardia spp. was then isolated and this let to began with a specific treatment. All the patients progress satisfactorily in their respiratory infection. DISCUSSION: Although there are usually factors that predispose to nocardiosis, it can also occur in absence of these, as it happened in one of report patients. The clinical and radiological manifestations are not, in many cases enough to reach the diagnosis. Thus germ isolation is very important, and invasive procedures are often essential to obtain a quality samples to cultivate.

DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: We studied the records of all HIV-infected patients with Salmonella bacteremia diagnosed at a university tertiary hospital from January 1987 to December 1995. RESULTS: Lung involvement was found in 18 (35.3%) of 51 HIV-infected individuals with Salmonella bacteremia. Six of 18 (33.3%) were diagnosed as having definite Salmonella pulmonary infection by isolation of Salmonella from respiratory specimens, while probable Salmonella lung disease was considered in two patients who developed lung abscesses without the identification of any pathogen. Predisposing factors for focal disease, such as prior lung disease or Salmonella serotype, were equally prevalent regardless of the presence of Salmonella pulmonary involvement. Cavitary infiltrates or abscess formation were seen in five of the eight patients. With the exception of one patient coinfected with Nocardia asteroides who died 1 month later, all patients were cured with antibiotic treatment. Superinfection with other pulmonary pathogens (10 cases, 56%) was more frequent than Salmonella pneumonia; the most frequent alternative diagnosis was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (5 cases, 28%), pyogenic bacterial infection (17%), and tuberculosis (11%). CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected patients with Salmonella bacteremia, lung involvement is frequent, although there were no significant factors to explain this association. Cavitary disease was the most common radiologic pattern, and focal lung disease due to Salmonella does not seem to be associated with a worse prognosis. Coinfection and superinfection with other respiratory pathogens are more common than isolated Salmonella lung disease, and therefore, additional diagnostic procedures must be considered in the evaluation of these patients."

The clinical and microbiologic spectrum of nocardiosis has changed recently due to the widespread use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, the emergence of new types of immunosuppressed patients, and the improved identification of isolates using molecular techniques. Nocardia asteroides was traditionally considered the predominant organism, and prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole was considered almost universally protective. We conducted the current study to determine the incidence of nocardiosis and its microbiologic and clinical characteristics in a general hospital over the last 12 years. We reviewed the clinical records of all patients in whom Nocardia species was isolated from clinical specimens between 1995 and 2006. Nocardia isolates were identified by standard procedures and by 5' end 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Susceptibility to cotrimoxazole, minocycline, imipenem, linezolid, and amikacin was determined by the broth microdilution method following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.The incidence of Nocardia infections did not increase significantly during the study period (0.39/100,000 inhabitants in 1995-1998 and 0.55/100,000 inhabitants in 2003-2006). Nocardia was recovered from 43 patients. Six were considered to be colonized. The colonizing species were N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. asteroides. All colonized patients had severe underlying pulmonary conditions and were treated with antimicrobials (6 patients) or corticosteroids (4 patients). Invasive nocardiosis was diagnosed in 37 patients (86.5% were men, and their mean age was 55.8 +/- 17.3 yr). The most common underlying condition in our institution was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (10 patients; 27%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8 patients; 21.6%), autoimmune diseases (8 patients; 21.6%), solid organ transplantation (7 patients; 18.9%), and cancer (4 patients; 10.8%). The most important risk factor for nocardiosis was corticosteroid administration (23 patients; 62.2%). Nocardiosis affected the lungs in 26 cases (70.3%), the skin in 3 cases (8.1%), and the central nervous system in 2 cases (5.4%). It was disseminated in 5 cases (13.5%) and caused otomastoiditis in 1 (2.7%). The species identified were N. cyriacigeorgica (32.4%), N. farcinica (24.3%), N. otitidiscaviarum (10.8%), N. veterana (8.1%), N. nova (5.4%), N. abscessus (5.4%), N. asiatica (2.7%), N. beijingensis (2.7%), N. brasiliensis (2.7%), N. carnea (2.7%), and Nocardia species (2.7%).Linezolid and amikacin were uniformly active against all the isolates, whereas 29.7% of isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to minocycline (minimum inhibitory concentration = 2 mg/L), 10.8% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, and 5.4% were resistant to imipenem. Nocardiosis occurred while the patients were on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 8 cases (21.6%). The strains isolated from these patients were susceptible to cotrimoxazole in 5 cases (62.5%) and resistant in 3 (37.5%). Overall, 13 patients died (35.1%); related mortality was 21.6% (8 patients). We conclude that HIV infection has become the most common underlying condition for invasive nocardiosis in our institution, followed by chronic lung disease. Previous use of corticosteroids was the main risk factor and was present in more than half the patients. New species of Nocardia have been identified, and administration of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should no longer be considered highly reliable protection against nocardiosis. Larger studies of nocardiosis are required to better identify risk factors associated with mortality, and alternative and more effective methods of prevention must be developed."

From 2003 to 2008, four nocardioform strains (W8027, W8681, W9071 and W9241(T)) were isolated from patients in the state of Florida, USA. Ribosomal gene sequencing analysis suggested that a novel species of the genus Nocardia had been isolated. These strains were subjected to a taxonomic analysis using a polyphasic approach. Phenotypic analyses included morphological examination, biochemical profiling and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Molecular studies included 16S rRNA and DNA gyrase B subunit (gyrB) gene sequence analyses and DNA-DNA hybridization. Phylogenetic neighbours were determined through 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequence analyses. Phenotypic characteristics that differentiated the novel isolates from phylogenetically related species were growth at 45  C, and three of the four novel strains utilized l-rhamnose. The antimicrobial profiles could not reliably distinguish the novel species from related nocardiae. Analysis showed that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the four novel isolates were identical.

The lungs are the primary site of infection mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. In rare circumstances even immunocompetent hosts may also develop infection. Diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is usually delayed due to nonspecific clinical and radiological presentations which mimic fungal, tuberculous, or neoplastic processes. The present report describes a rare bronchoscopic presentation of an endobronchial nocardial mass in a 55-year-old immunocompetent woman without underlying lung disease. The patient exhibited signs and symptoms of unresolving community-acquired pneumonia with a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed a space-occupying lesion and enlarged paratracheal lymph node. This patient represents the unusual presentation of pulmonary Nocardia beijingensis as an endobronchial mass. Pathology obtained during bronchoscopy demonstrated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation of nocardiosis. Symptoms and clinical findings improved with antibiotic treatment. This patient emphasizes the challenge in making the diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis, especially in a low risk host. A literature review presents the difficulties and pitfalls in the clinical assessment of such an individual. "

He presented with cardiac tamponade after failing to respond to treatment for smear-negative pulmonary and pericardial tuberculosis (TB). The pericardial fluid was examined several times before it eventually revealed filamentous branching organisms in Gram and modified acid-fast bacilli stain. The culture grew Nocardia spp. and was identified by 16s rRNA sequencing as N. beijingensis. Eight previously reported cases of Nocardia pericarditis in HIV-infected patients were caused by Nocardia asteroides. All patients had low CD4 cell count (range: 17-239 cells/mm3) and 50% of patients were treated for tuberculous pericarditis prior to making the correct diagnosis of Nocardia pericarditis.

METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study (1:2 ratio) between January 1995 and December 2005. Control subjects were matched for transplant type and timing. Univariate matched odds ratios were determined and conditional logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of all case patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Among 5126 organ transplant recipients, 35 (0.6%) were identified as having cases of Nocardia infection. The highest frequency was among recipients of lung transplants (18 [3.5%] of 521 patients), followed by recipients of heart (10 [2.5%] of 392), intestinal (2 [1.3%] of 155), kidney (3 [0.2%] of 1717), and liver (2 [0.1%] of 1840) transplants. In a comparison of case patients with 70 matched control subjects, receipt of high-dose steroids (odds ratio, 27; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-235; P=.003) and cytomegalovirus disease (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-46; P=.047) in the preceding 6 months and a high median calcineurin inhibitor level in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-22; P=.012) were found to be independent risk factors for Nocardia infection. The majority of case patients (27 [77%] of 35) had pulmonary disease only. Seven transplant recipients (20%) had disseminated disease. Nocardia nova was the most common species (found in 17 [49%] of the patients), followed by Nocardia farcinica (9 [28%]), Nocardia asteroides (8 [23%]), and Nocardia brasiliensis (1 [3%]). Of the 35 case patients, 24 (69%) were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Thirty-one case patients (89%) experienced cure of their Nocardia infection. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of high-dose steroids, history of cytomegalovirus disease, and high levels of calcineurin inhibitors are independent risk factors for Nocardia infection in organ transplant recipients.

METHODS: The clinical and radiological data of 2 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis in this hospital were presented, and 32 cases reported in the Chinese literature since 1982 were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the 34 cases of Nocardia infections, there were 26 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis, and 4 of whom died. Multiple organ infection occurred in 11 patients, including 7 with pulmonary and skin infections, 3 with pulmonary, skin and intracranial infections, and 1 with pulmonary and intracranial infections. All patients with pulmonary nocardiosis had cough. Of the 34 cases, 27 had fever, including intermittent fever in 5, and sustained fever in 22 cases. Of the 11 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis complicated with skin or intracranial dissemination, 8 patients were immunocompromised and 3 were immunocompetent (chi(2) = 2.08, P &gt; 0.05). Three cases died in the immunocompromised group and 1 died in the immunocompetent group. Nocardia asteroides was identified in 14 cases, Nocardia brasiliensis in 4 cases, and the other 8 were not classified. In the patients with complicated skin or intracranial infections, 8 were caused by Nocardia asteroids, and 2 were caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. Chest X-ray or CT imaging of the lungs showed pleural effusion in 8, masses in 7, infiltrates in 6, cavities in 6, and nodular lesions in 5 cases. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that Nocardia was sensitive to sulfonamide, amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, minocycline, fluoroquinolones, and linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression is the most important predisposing factor for pulmonary nocardiosis. The most common pathogenic bacterium is Nocardia asteroids, which is frequently associated with disseminated lesions. The radiographic abnormalities of the lung show pleural effusion, masses, infiltration or cavity. With the increasing rate of resistance of Nocardia to the sulfonamide, the combination of antibiotic regimen according to susceptibility testing needs to be considered. Poor outcome is mostly found in immunocompromised hosts."

They can also cause localized cutaneous and soft tissue infections in healthy people after direct percutaneous inoculation. Nocardia arthritis is rare in both forms of the disease. Here we present the first published case of a child with septic arthritis caused by N brasiliensis. Importantly, this otherwise well 4-year-old girl had no known history of trauma but presented with transient cutaneous lesions and a 6-week history of arthritis involving the right fourth digit proximal interphalangeal joint without accompanying fever or raised systemic inflammatory markers. She received a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and underwent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressant therapy. After 2 months she developed frank septic arthritis, which necessitated a surgical joint washout, from which an intraoperative swab grew N brasiliensis. The patient received 6 months of high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and remains well more than 4 years after treatment. This unusual case highlights the importance of considering an indolent infection from slow-growing organisms, including Nocardia, when diagnosing the oligoarthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This is especially relevant when a single joint is involved and response to antiinflammatory therapy is suboptimal because antiinflammatory agents may mask evolving signs of infection. "

We report a patient with hyperthyroidism due to suppurative thyroiditis caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. A 38-year-old Black male presented with features of thyrotoxicosis, sepsis and airway obstruction. He had no evidence of underlying thyroid disease, but was severely immunocompromised as a result of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. He had previously been diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis and also had nocardial abscesses on his anterior chest wall. Investigations revealed thyrotoxicosis, with a FT4 of 43.2 pmol/l and a suppressed TSH &lt;0.01 mIU/l. Serum anti-thyroperoxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were absent. Computed tomography scan showed a large abscess in the anterior neck involving the left lobe and isthmus, as well as inhomogeneous changes in the right lobe of the thyroid. The radioisotopic scan showed absent uptake of tracer in keeping with thyroiditis. Although the initial presentation was that of hyperthyroidism, destruction of the gland later resulted in sustained hypothyroidism, necessitating thyroid hormone supplementation. The hyperthyroidism can be explained by the release of presynthesized and stored thyroid hormone into the circulation as a result of inflammation and disruption of the thyroid follicles, and the subsequent hypothyroidism by the fact that much of the gland was destroyed by the abscess and the extensive inflammatory process. This is the first documented case of hyperthyroidism in a patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by Nocardia. "

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric retrospective analysis of patients presenting with Nocardia-positive biological sample from January 1, 1998 to May 1, 2017. RESULTS: We identified nine cases of Nocardia infections. Risk factors were oral corticosteroid therapy (n=3), solid cancer (n=2), hematological cancer (n=1), COPD (n=1). No risk factor was identified in patients with isolated cutaneous presentation (n=2). Disseminated presentations (n=3) were observed in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (n=2) and presenting with ENT cancer (n=1). Identified Nocardia species were Nocardia nova (n=4), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia abscessus (n=1), Nocardia brasiliensis (n=1), and Nocardia asteroides (n=1). The median diagnostic time was 17 days. Antibiotic therapy was prolonged and included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 6/9 cases. The overall one-year case fatality was high (3/8). No recurrence was observed. We identified two cases of respiratory colonization with N. abscessus and N. cyriacigeorgica in COPD patients. CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis can occur both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. It is a severe infection, with a miscellaneous clinical spectrum and complex treatments. Greater knowledge of nocardiosis is required from physicians for optimal medical care."

This study aimed to investigate the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of a large number of contemporary (2011-2016) clinical Nocardia species referred to a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy Nocardia isolates identified to the species level by dual target gene sequencing were investigated. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre  RAPMYCOI panel with the minimum inhibitory concentration and geometric mean obtained for each species and drug combination. The susceptibility profiles and species distribution were analysed. RESULTS: The respiratory system is the most affected site of nocardiosis. N. nova complex was the most frequently isolated Nocardia species (n = 80, 29.6%) in this survey followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 61, 22.6%), N. brasiliensis (n = 52, 19.3%) and N. farcinica (n = 38, 14.1%). Of the tested isolates, 9.3% and 59.3% displayed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem respectively. N. farcinica accounted for the highest number of resistant strains to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. High imipenem resistance in N. cyriacigeogica is atypical to its drug pattern but has been reported elsewhere. All tested isolates remained susceptible to linezolid with only 0.7% exhibiting resistance to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid and amikacin remain as good empiric option for nocardiosis treatment. Routine susceptibility testing for Nocardia is advisable with the detection of sulphonamide resistance and atypical antibiograms in this study."

A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a high fever and a productive cough. His chest radiograph and CT scan revealed infiltrative shadows in the right middle and lower lung fields. Although several antibiotics (third-generation cephalosporin, minocycline, imipenem) were administered, the fever and cough persisted, and C-reactive protein remained elevated. Repeated sputum cultures showed normal flora, so a transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed bronchoscopically at the right S5. The BAL fluid contained acid-fast, branching filamentous structures. The microorganism was identified as N. otitidiscaviarum by the Research Center for Pathogenic Fungi and Microbial Toxicoses (Chiba University). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was therefore administered, but the fever continued to rise daily, and C-reactive protein remained elevated. This isolated N. otitidiscaviarum showed resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents in vitro when examined by the disk diffusion method, and so, on the basis of the antibiogram, the patient was treated with clarithromycin (oral, 600 mg/day) plus amikacin (400 mg/day), which proved successful. Testing for pulmonary nocardiosis should be added to the differential diagnosis procedures for refractory pneumonia as an opportunistic infection and for community-acquired pneumonia."

OBJECTIVE: To study the predisposing factors, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment and progress of pulmonary nocardiosis (PN). METHODS: Review of 10 patients (9 male, 1 female, mean age 61) with PN in a 600-bed teaching hospital, diagnosed from 1992 to 1999. RESULTS: Associated diseases observed were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 6 patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 3 and polymyalgia rheumatica in 1. Four patients had received oral corticotherapy for COPD for over a year (mean dose 13 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). The main reason for consultation was an increase in dyspnea in the patients with COPD (6/6) and fever in those with HIV (3/3). Mean time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 5 weeks. In 8 patients, the infection occurred outside the hospital setting. The infection was restricted to the lung in 9/10; in the remaining case, the central nervous system (CNS) and subcutaneous tissue were affected. Lobar or multilobar consolidation was the most frequent radiographic pattern found (6/10). Sputum culture was positive when performed (8 cases). Diagnosis was made or confirmed by bronchoscopy (bronchoaspirate or protected specimen brush) in 5 patients. Germs isolated were: Nocardia asteroides (8/10), Nocardia farcinica (1/10), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (1/10). Cotrimoxazole was the most used empirical treatment (6/10). Resolution was achieved in 5 cases. Four subjects died: 1 HIV patient with disseminated nocardiosis, and 3 COPD patients, 2 of whom had received long-term corticotherapy. Illness recurred in only 1 case, due to failure to comply with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: (1) In our geographical setting Nocardia presents as a subacute or chronic pulmonary infection, mainly outside the hospital. (2) It tends to affect only the lung. (3) Diagnosis requires a high clinical suspicion, and can be made on the basis of a sputum culture. (4) Nocardia tends to attack patients with underlying COPD, or immunodepressed patients treated with glucocorticoids, or patients with HIV infection. (5) Mortality is high in both COPD and HIV patients. (6) In our area, cotrimoxazole seems to be the most commonly prescribed treatment."

A total of 63 clinical isolates were referred to the NRC and identified as Nocardia asteroides (66.7%), Nocardia farcinica (23.8%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.2%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (4.8%) and Nocardia carnea (1.5%). Nocardia asteroides accounted for 71.4% of pulmonary infections, 80.0% of central nervous system infections and 80.0% of systemic infections. Patients infected with Nocardia farcinica died in 57.1% of cases, compared with 17.6% of patients infected with Nocardia asteroides. Corticosteroid therapy represented a significant factor in mortality. Isolates of Nocardia asteroides revealed variable resistance, whereas isolates of Nocardia farcinica were resistant to most antimicrobial agents. Only amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefoxitin, kanamycin, amikacin, minocycline and vancomycin showed activity against both species.

Cutaneous-subcutaneous, pulmonary and systemic signs are observed in feline nocardiosis. However, osteomyelitis is a rare clinical manifestation in cats. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly N. asteroides sensu stricto), Nocardia brasiliensis, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia nova are the most common pathogenic species identified in cats, based on recent molecular classification (16S rRNA gene). The present report is, to our knowledge, the first case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a cat caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of methods, including molecular techniques. CASE PRESENTATION: A one-year-old non-neutered female cat, raised in a rural area, was admitted to the Companion Animal Hospital-PUCPR, Sao Jose dos Pinhais, State of Parana, Brazil, with a history a progressive facial lesion, difficulty apprehending food, loss of appetite, apathy and emaciation. Clinical examination showed fever, submandibular lymphadenitis, and a painless, 8 cm diameter mass, which was irregularly-shaped, of firm consistency, and located in the region of the left mandible. The skin around the lesion was friable, with diffuse inflammation (cellulitis), multiple draining sinuses, and exudation of serosanguinous material containing whitish ""sulfur"" granules.Diagnosis was based initially in clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological, and histopathological findings, and radiographic images. Molecular sequencing of 16S rRNA of isolate allowed diagnosis of Nocardia africana. Despite supportive care and antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing the animal died. CONCLUSION: The present report describes a rare clinical case of feline osteomyelitis caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological and histopathological findings, radiographic images, and molecular methods. The use of modern molecular techniques constitutes a quick and reliable method for Nocardia species identification, and may contribute to identification to new species of Nocardia that are virulent in cats."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. DISCUSSION: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections.

Following a poor response to beta-lactam antibiotic, a combination of sulfonamide with minocycline was administered, which successfully ameliorated the symptoms. Previous studies published in English were retrieved from PubMed with 'Nocardia otitidiscaviarum' used as the search keyword. A total of 23 articles were retrieved from the PubMed database, supporting the assertion that N. otitidiscaviarum is a rare Nocardia species. Among these 23 cases, there were 11 cases of lymphocutaneous (48%), 5 of pulmonary (22%), 2 of brain (9%) and 1 of pyothorax (4%) infection, and 4 cases of disseminated infections (17%). Analysis of the immune state of these patients demonstrated that 9 were immunocompetent (39%), 7 of whom had cutaneous infections (30%) with a predominant history of trauma (6/7), and 14 were immunosuppressed, 9 of whom were treated with prednisolone. Microbiology and histopathology were necessary in all cases for definite diagnosis. Among the 13 cases who underwent drug susceptibility testing, 10 cases were sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and 12 cases were sensitive to aminoglycoside. In conclusion, although N. otitidiscaviarum is one of the less commonly isolated species of Nocardia, it is capable of inducing localized or disseminated infection, even in an immunocompetent host. The majority of cases respond well to TMP-SMX and aminoglycoside, but the therapeutic action of cephalosporin is weak. Identification of bacteria and drug sensitivity tests for Nocardia is critical for guiding clinical treatment."

Methods: Over a 10 year period (2005-14), 1119 Nocardia strains were molecularly identified and subjected to the Etest. The distribution and resistance trends over the sub-periods 2005-09 and 2010-14 were also examined. Results: Of the strains examined, 82.9% belonged to the following species: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (25.3%), Nocardia nova (15.0%), Nocardia abscessus (12.7%), Nocardia farcinica (11.4%), Nocardia carnea (4.3%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.5%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (3.1%), Nocardia flavorosea (2.6%), Nocardia rhamnosiphila (2.6%) and Nocardia transvalensis (2.4%). Their prevalence values were similar during 2005-09 and 2010-14, except for those of N. abscessus , N. farcinica and N. transvalensis , which fell significantly in the second sub-period ( P &lt;=  0.05). The major location of isolation was the respiratory tract (~86%). Half (13/27) of all strains from the CNS were N. farcinica . Significant differences in MIC results were recorded for some species between the two sub-periods. According to the CLSI's breakpoints, low resistance rates (&lt;=15%) were recorded for seven species with respect to cefotaxime, imipenem and tobramycin; five species showed similar rates with respect to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Linezolid and amikacin were the most frequently active agents. Conclusion: The accurate identification of the infecting species and the determination of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, given the large number of strains with atypical patterns, are crucial if patients with nocardiosis are to be successfully treated."

Six years ago, she had been diagnosed with bronchial asthma and was treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Chest radiograph and computed tomography on admission showed infiltrates in the right middle lobe, a mass lesion in the left lower lobe, and bronchiectasis in both lower lobes.

However, its immunological features remain largely unaddressed. We investigated the immunological characteristics of human nocardiosis and examined the component cells of the granulomatous lesions. A 66-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presented with fever and multiple nodules in the lung during chemotherapy. The blood culture formed white colonies, but their characterization was difficult by routine microbiological laboratory methods. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry identified the colonies as Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. Meanwhile, the patient suddenly experienced an epileptic seizure without a brain abscess. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed neutrophilic pleocytosis (108/mm3). The conventional agar culturing failed to isolate colonies, but culturing with brain-heart infusion agar generated colonies. These colonies were completely concordant with those from the blood, as confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Therefore, the patient had developed meningitis through sepsis induced by N. otitidiscaviarum. His CD4-positive T-lymphocyte counts were low, and oligoclonal CD8-positive alphabeta T-lymphocytes were present in the blood prior to the first and after three cycles of chemotherapy. He had bone marrow granulomatous lesions comprising lymphoma and CD8-positive alphabeta T-cells. Treatment with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim relieved all of his symptoms. The combined analysis by microbiological and molecular methods determined the cause of his epileptic seizure. His immunological characteristics, including low CD4-positive or CD8-positive alphabeta T-lymphocytes, may have contributed to the unusual clinical presentations by N. otitidiscaviarum, which rarely involves the central nervous system."

We report two cases of fatal pulmonary infection caused by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in elderly patients. METHODOLOGY: Case 1: A 70-year old woman presented with fever and cough with expectoration for a month. On physical examination, she had tachypnea and inspiratory crepitations in bilateral basal regions. Case 2: A 74-year old man presented with productive cough with foul smelling expectoration, fever and shortness of breath for one week. On examination, he had tachypnea, bilateral wheezing and inspiratory crepitations. In both cases, sputum was sent to microbiology laboratory. On direct microscopy Gram-positive, finely branching filaments were observed which were acid fast with 1% sulphuric acid. Chalky white opaque wrinkled colonies with musty basement type odour were seen on blood agar. Both patients were treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Nocardia infection after notification of microscopy findings however both expired on Day 2 and Day 5 of admission, respectively. Both isolates were susceptible to amikacin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. They were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin, and imipenem. Based on biochemical identification and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, the organism was identified as Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. The identification was confirmed using MALDI-TOF (Vitek MS, Biomerieux, France). CONCLUSION: Our report highlights the importance of early identification of Nocardia to species level to improve treatment outcomes especially in critically ill patients. Mass spectrometry can become an integral part of diagnostic algorithms for nocardiosis."

Despite being uncommon, N. otitidiscaviarum has been associated with skin, lung, and disseminated infections. Case report: A 56-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent travel to the Bahamas presented to the emergency room with complains of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and non-bloody diarrhea for four days. He ultimately required a PICC line for total parenteral nutrition. 2 days after line placement, he developed high fevers and severe right arm pain. Diagnostic imaging revealed venous thrombosis of cephalic vein and abscess formation within the soft tissue of right axilla with cultures ultimately growing Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. He underwent surgical incision and drainage of the abscess followed up with complete excision of the right cephalic vein and antecubital vein as well as sharp excisional debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle fascia and was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 months. Conclusion: Nocardia otitidiscaviarum treatment of cutaneous disease consists of trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole for three to six months. While guidelines for surgical intervention for cutaneous infection are not specified, our patient required surgical incision and drainage of abscess, along with excision of vein due to necrosis in addition to antibiotic treatment for 3 months with successful outcomes."

METHODS: In this 1.5-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of mNGS of BALF for identifying pathogens of SCAP in hospitalized adults, comparing it with other laboratory methods. RESULTS: Of 329 SCAP adults, a microbial etiology was established in 304 cases (92.4%). The overall microbial yield was 90.3% for mNGS versus 39.5% for other methods (P < 0.05). The most frequently detected pathogens in immunocompetent patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.8%), rhinovirus (9.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.7%), and Chlamydia psittaci (8.0%), while in immunocompromised patients they were Pneumocystis jirovecii (44.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%). Notably, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified from two patients solely by mNGS in January 2020; uncommon pathogens including Orientia tsutsugamushi and Nocardia otitidiscaviarum were identified from one patient, respectively. Furthermore, mixed infections were detected in 56.8% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high microbial detection rate was achieved in SCAP adults using mNGS testing of BALF.

Eighteen patients (90%) had at least one underlying disease/condition. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica was most commonly found. Compared with those whose pathogens were other Nocardia spp., patients with pulmonary nocardiosis caused by N cyriacigeorgica experienced higher clinical severity as measured by APACHE II score (19.8 +- 7.0 vs. 12.8 +- 6.7; p = 0.04) and ICU admission rate (100% vs. 25%; p &lt; 0.01). Thirteen patients (65%) turned out to be fatal. The severity (APACHE II score, 18 +- 6 vs. 10 +- 8; p = 0.02) and the proportion of acute and subacute pulmonary nocardiosis (76% vs. 0%, p = 0.03) between fatal and survived patients differed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: N cyriacigeorgica was the most common pathogen in southern Taiwan. Higher mortality rate in patients with pulmonary nocardiosis was related to disease severity and acute and subacute infection."

Cutaneous-subcutaneous, pulmonary and systemic signs are observed in feline nocardiosis. However, osteomyelitis is a rare clinical manifestation in cats. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly N. asteroides sensu stricto), Nocardia brasiliensis, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia nova are the most common pathogenic species identified in cats, based on recent molecular classification (16S rRNA gene). The present report is, to our knowledge, the first case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a cat caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of methods, including molecular techniques. CASE PRESENTATION: A one-year-old non-neutered female cat, raised in a rural area, was admitted to the Companion Animal Hospital-PUCPR, Sao Jose dos Pinhais, State of Parana, Brazil, with a history a progressive facial lesion, difficulty apprehending food, loss of appetite, apathy and emaciation. Clinical examination showed fever, submandibular lymphadenitis, and a painless, 8 cm diameter mass, which was irregularly-shaped, of firm consistency, and located in the region of the left mandible. The skin around the lesion was friable, with diffuse inflammation (cellulitis), multiple draining sinuses, and exudation of serosanguinous material containing whitish ""sulfur"" granules.Diagnosis was based initially in clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological, and histopathological findings, and radiographic images. Molecular sequencing of 16S rRNA of isolate allowed diagnosis of Nocardia africana. Despite supportive care and antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing the animal died. CONCLUSION: The present report describes a rare clinical case of feline osteomyelitis caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological and histopathological findings, radiographic images, and molecular methods. The use of modern molecular techniques constitutes a quick and reliable method for Nocardia species identification, and may contribute to identification to new species of Nocardia that are virulent in cats."

The incidence of nocardiosis varies geographically according to several factors, such as the prevalence of HIV infections, transplants, neoplastic and rheumatic diseases, as well as climate, socio-economic conditions and laboratory procedures for Nocardia detection and identification. In Brazil the paucity of clinical reports of Nocardia infections suggests that this genus may be underestimated as a cause of human diseases and/or either neglected or misidentified in laboratory specimens. Accurate identification of Nocardia species has become increasingly important for clinical and epidemiological investigations. In this study, seven clinical Nocardia isolates were identified by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and their antimicrobial susceptibility was also determined. Most Nocardia isolates were associated to pulmonary disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of Brazilian human isolates in cases reported in literature were identified as Nocardia sp. Molecular characterization was used for species identification of Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia asiatica and Nocardia exalbida/gamkensis. Data indicated that molecular analysis provided a different Nocardia speciation than the initial biochemical identification for most Brazilian isolates. All Nocardia isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobial of choice in the treatment nocardiosis. N. nova isolated from different clinical specimens from one patient showed identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and two distinct clones. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country in terms of land mass and population, pulmonary, extrapulmonary and systemic forms of nocardiosis were reported in only 6 of the 26 Brazilian states from 1970 to 2013. A least 33.8% of these 46 cases of nocardiosis proved fatal. Interestingly, coinfection by two clones may occur in patients presenting nocardiosis. Nocardia infection may be more common throughout the Brazilian territory and in other developing tropical countries than is currently recognized and MLSA should be used more extensively as an effective method for Nocardia identification."

The organisms opportunistically infect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. The lungs are the primary site of infection and brain abscess is, by far, the most common complication following nocardial metastasis from pulmonary lesions. Although surgical intervention must always be considered in the treatment of nocardial brain abscess, it can obviously be cured by antibiotic therapy alone. This report describes a case infected by Nocardia cyriacigeorgica. Identification of the infectious agent was achieved by conventional and semi-nested PCR techniques. A 55-year-old woman with fever was referred to the infect disclinic of Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran and was hospitalized after clinical assessment. She was a kidney transplant recipient for 4 years and was taking immunosuppressive treatment including azathioprine and methylprednisolone. Follow-up of the patient by CT scan revealed pulmonary infection and cerebral lesions. Specimens of the brain lesions contained filamentous bacteria. The patient received a combination of co-trimoxazole and ceftriaxone and brain abscesses as well as lung inflammation disappeared gradually during the course of antibiotic therapy within 3 months.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. DISCUSSION: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections. Nocardiosis manifests various clinical features depending on the Nocardia species and underlying conditions."

METHODS: We determined the species and drug susceptibility of 138 Nocardia strains isolated from 132 patients at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) from 2002 through 2012 and analyzed the clinical features. RESULTS: The 132 patients included 82 men and 50 women with a mean age of 59.1 years. All except two had underlying cancer, and 47 (35.6%) also received a stem cell transplant. These patients experienced 136 episodes of Nocardia infection, including pulmonary infection, abscess of deep skin and soft tissue, bacteremia and dissemination, and brain abscess. The 138 Nocardia strains involved 27 species, of which 20 species have been described since 2000. Common species included Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia farcinica, and Nocardia abscessus, together accounting for 59.4%. N nova caused most bacteremia cases, whereas N farcinica caused most of the skin and brain infections. Infections with a few recent species likely represented first confirmation or report of human infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of 117 strains showed that they were all susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and linezolid but variably susceptible to other drugs depending on species. Most patients who were treated for the infection showed improvement or resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse Nocardia species can cause secondary infections in patients with cancer.

Here we report for the first time two cases of pulmonary nocardiosis caused by Nocardia cyriacigeorgica associated with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease caused by M. avium. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 is that of a 72-year-old Japanese man with untreated MAC lung disease, who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and initiated on methotrexate. After 3 years of methotrexate therapy, the patient remained smear-negative and culture-positive for MAC, but also became smear-positive for Nocardia species. He received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and his symptoms and lung infiltrates improved. Case 2 is that of an immunocompetent 53-year-old Japanese woman with MAC lung disease, who was treated with a combined therapy of clarithromycin, rifampicin, ethambutol, and levofloxacin. MAC sputum culture was negative after 1 year of combined treatment, which was maintained for 2 years. After four treatment-free years, Nocardia species were occasionally isolated from her sputum, although MAC was rarely isolated from sputum cultures over the same period.

PN is characterized by non-specific symptoms and radiological findings; bacteriological culture can be difficult. For the reasons above, diagnosis of PN is challenging, sometimes resulting in a misdiagnosis of tuberculosis. We report an interesting case of PN in a 75-year-old male with COPD. He complained a 3-months history of fatigue, evening rise in body temperature, night sweats, unexplained weight loss of 5 kg, worsening dyspnea, cough and mucopurulent sputum. The chest X-ray showed multiple nodules with cavitations bilaterally in the apical and subclavian regions. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica with 100% identity was identified in three sputum samples. Since the patient has never undergone a systemic and/or inhaled steroid therapy, and has no respiratory failure and comorbidities entailing immunodepression, it is conceivable that, in this immunocompetent patient, the COPD could represent an isolated risk factor for PN. Risk factors, clinical presentations, radiographic findings, differential diagnosis and review of the literature of PN cases in COPD, pointing out the similarities and differences, are also described.

We aimed to characterize the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical features of nocardiosis in the tropical north of Australia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of nocardiosis diagnosed between 1997 and 2014. Population-based incidences were calculated using district population data. RESULTS: Clinically significant nocardiosis was identified in 61 patients. The unadjusted population-based annual incidence of nocardiosis was 2.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-2.60) per 100000 people and was 1.7 (95% CI, .96-2.90) fold higher in Indigenous compared with non-Indigenous persons (P = .027). Of 61 patients, 47 (77%) had chronic lung disease, diabetes, and/or hazardous alcohol consumption; 22 (36%) were immunocompromised; and 8 (13%) had no identified comorbidities. Disease presentations included pulmonary (69%; 42 of 61), cutaneous (13%; 8 of 61), and disseminated nocardiosis (15%; 9 of 61). The most commonly identified species were Nocardia asteroides and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (each 11%). Linezolid was the only antimicrobial to which isolates were universally susceptible; 89% (48 of 54), 60% (32 of 53), and 48% (26 of 54) of isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and imipenem, respectively. Eighteen patients (30%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 1-year mortality was 31%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nocardiosis in tropical Australia is amongst the highest reported globally. Nocardiosis occurs in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, and it is associated with high rates of ICU admission, 1-year mortality, and resistance to commonly recommended antimicrobials.

In most cases, nocardiosis manifests as a lung infection or a bone lesion. Due to the nonspecific and mild clinical manifestations of nocardiosis, the establishment of definite diagnosis can be difficult. When antibiotic therapy is incorrectly targeted, only the symptoms of the disease are suppressed. The mainstay in the treatment of Nocardia osteomyelitis has so far been the combined surgical debridement with long-term, initially intravenous, antibiotic administration. We present the successful conservative treatment of a nocardiosis osteomyelitis of the tibia caused by the Nocardia cyriacigeorgica species in an 81-year-old female patient that manifested itself as a secondary affection on top of a primary nocardiosis infection of the lung. From microbiological examination, N. cyriacigeorgica was discovered; the identification was made using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with an identification score of 1.9. The sensitivity was evaluated using E test. Sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, imipenem, and linezolid was demonstrated. The bacteria were shown to be resistant to ciprofloxacin. For treatment, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was used due to the value of minimum inhibitory concentration, which was 0.25 mg/L. The initial dose of 960 mg of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole every 8 h was reduced to 960 mg every 12 h after 3 months. The total duration of treatment was 7.5 months. Under the established treatment, the bone and lung lesions healed. Nocardiosis of the long bone is considered a rare disease and its precise diagnosis has not yet been standardized. We used the MALDI-TOF MS method for the identification of the causal organism which is a fast and reliable method according to current world literature even when compared with the rRNA genetic sequencing reference method.

Accurate microbiological data are essential to guide antibiotic treatment. Our primary objective was to describe species identification and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for Nocardia isolates analysed over a 6-year period. Secondary objectives were to study temporal trends in species distribution and AST results. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed results from Nocardia isolates sent between January 2010 and December 2015 to a French laboratory dedicated to Nocardia (Observatoire Francais des Nocardioses). Species identification was obtained by amplification and sequencing of a 600-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene (for all isolates) and of hsp65 (when required). AST was performed using disk diffusion. RESULTS: We included 793 Nocardia isolates, mostly from the lungs (53.8%). The most frequent species were Nocardia farcinica (20.2%), Nocardia abscessus complex (19.9%) and Nocardia nova complex (19.5%). The proportion of N. farcinica increased significantly over time from 13% in 2010 to 27.6% in 2014. Linezolid, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and imipenem were the most frequently identified active antibiotics with, respectively, 0% (0/734), 2.9% (21/730), 5.4% (40/734), 9.4% (69/734) and 19.5% (143/732) of isolates not susceptible. Nocardia farcinica was frequently not susceptible to cefotaxime (118/148, 79.7% of the isolates), but only about 5% of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica and N. abscessus complex isolates were not susceptible to cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: In this first epidemiological study of Nocardia isolated from human samples in France, N. farcinica was the species most frequently identified and its prevalence increased over time."

The polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme analysis (PRA) method and DNA sequence analysis method were utilized to target a gene region that codes the 65-kDa heat-shock protein for typing 150 suspected NTM samples isolated from the respiratory tract. Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium peregrinum were most frequently found by both methods. Six isolates that could not be defined by the PRA method were defined as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia abscessus, and Mycobacterium intracellulare by DNA sequence analysis. Discordance between the results of the two methods was observed for only one isolate. The isolate that was defined as Mycobacterium gordonae type 6 by the PRA method was defined as Mycobacterium senegalense by sequence analysis. The PRA method is simple and gives rapid results. Compared with DNA sequence analysis, it gives consistent and reliable results up to a ratio of 90%. DNA sequence analysis is the gold standard method in which all strains can be defined. However, given our laboratory conditions, its disadvantage is that it takes longer to reach a diagnosis than through the PRA method."

Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) is a neoplastic disorder which leads to impaired cell-mediated immunity, and is commonly associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Because pulmonary infection and causative malignancy can appear as pulmonary lesions with EAS, differentiation of these diseases remains a critical issue for physicians. CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman with progressive lower limb paralysis and general fatigue was referred to us. She had been diagnosed with olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) and treated with surgery and radiation therapy 10 years before the referral and had required stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy 4 years later for a relapse of the ONB. On referral, she presented with Cushing's syndrome with elevated cortisol and ACTH levels. Potassium supplement improved her symptoms; however, a month later, she was urgently hospitalized due to acute pleuritic chest pain on inspiration. Chest computed tomography revealed left lower lobular consolidations and a contralateral nodule in the right middle lobe. The clinical history and laboratory work-up suggested that her Cushing's syndrome had most likely arisen from EAS. Additionally, the lungs were suspected as the ACTH source due to high levels of progastrin-releasing peptide and progressive pulmonary consolidation with a contralateral nodule, suggesting SCLC. However, histological examination from bronchoscopy revealed no evidence of malignancy, and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim improved her pulmonary lesions. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy revealed strong tracer uptake in the ONB lesions, indicating that the origin of the EAS was the olfactory tumor. However, histological examination of ONB specimens resected 10 years earlier showed no intracytoplasmic immunopositivity for ACTH. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight a rare case of pulmonary nocardiosis, which was associated with EAS mimicking SCLC, and was related to ONB transformation. Nocardiosis has to be considered even though anamnestic, clinical, and radiological aspects suggest the presence of metastasis. Additionally, physicians should carefully monitor patients with ONB for the development of Cushing's symptoms because the tumor can transform into an ACTH-producing form, even after long-term follow-up."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric retrospective analysis of patients presenting with Nocardia-positive biological sample from January 1, 1998 to May 1, 2017. RESULTS: We identified nine cases of Nocardia infections. Risk factors were oral corticosteroid therapy (n=3), solid cancer (n=2), hematological cancer (n=1), COPD (n=1). No risk factor was identified in patients with isolated cutaneous presentation (n=2). Disseminated presentations (n=3) were observed in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (n=2) and presenting with ENT cancer (n=1). Identified Nocardia species were Nocardia nova (n=4), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia abscessus (n=1), Nocardia brasiliensis (n=1), and Nocardia asteroides (n=1). The median diagnostic time was 17 days. Antibiotic therapy was prolonged and included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 6/9 cases. The overall one-year case fatality was high (3/8). No recurrence was observed. We identified two cases of respiratory colonization with N. abscessus and N. cyriacigeorgica in COPD patients. CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis can occur both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. It is a severe infection, with a miscellaneous clinical spectrum and complex treatments. Greater knowledge of nocardiosis is required from physicians for optimal medical care."

Nocardia cyriacigeorgica was first isolated in 2001 from a patient with chronic bronchitis. Since then, there have been reports on the clinical significance of this organism in patients with bronchitis, brain abscess and lung diseases. We, herein, report a case of brain abscess in an elderly diabetic patient from Iran. Case presentation: The patient was a 73 year-old woman admitted to hospital due to severe headache and shortness of breath. The patient had lived with diabetes for 20 years and suffered from chronic foot ulcer. She was admitted to hospital with fever, weakness, drowsiness and vomiting. Clinical examination and the head CT scan of the left frontal lobe of the brain revealed a metastatic carcinoma involving skull bone in the tumor that resulted in two surgical operations in the following two years. The brain abscess biopsy revealed an infection with Nocardia cyriacigeorgica confirmed by phenotypic and molecular tests including a PCR-based amplification of a target genetic marker, a 596 bp fragment of 16S rRNA gene, followed by almost full 16S rRNA sequencing. Conclusion: The rare infections, such as brain abscess with Nocardia, are easily neglected or misdiagnosed due to the fastidious nature of the organism and inadequate microbiological experience of laboratories in the hospitals of developing countries. This case shows that hospitals should consider a better laboratory protocol to deal with the clinical cases in which fastidious organisms, and in particular Nocardia, are involved."

The authors present the case of a woman with giant-cell arteritis, on oral steroids, who developed cavitating pneumonia due to co-infection with Aspergillus and Nocardia. Reports of such co-infection are rare in the literature. This case highlights the importance of considering rare pathogens in immunosuppressed patients who present with non-specific symptoms, as well as the impact of such pathogens on clinical management. Another important issue is the need for prophylaxis against Nocardia spp. in immunocompromised patients. LEARNING POINTS: In patients with vasculitis on systemic corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive treatment, suspicion of uncommon infection should increase in parallel with the cumulative dose of these drugs.Obtaining an accurate diagnosis and early treatment is essential, but can be very challenging.Regular prophylactic therapy should be considered.

This study aimed to investigate the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of a large number of contemporary (2011-2016) clinical Nocardia species referred to a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy Nocardia isolates identified to the species level by dual target gene sequencing were investigated. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre  RAPMYCOI panel with the minimum inhibitory concentration and geometric mean obtained for each species and drug combination. The susceptibility profiles and species distribution were analysed. RESULTS: The respiratory system is the most affected site of nocardiosis. N. nova complex was the most frequently isolated Nocardia species (n = 80, 29.6%) in this survey followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 61, 22.6%), N. brasiliensis (n = 52, 19.3%) and N. farcinica (n = 38, 14.1%). Of the tested isolates, 9.3% and 59.3% displayed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem respectively. N. farcinica accounted for the highest number of resistant strains to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. High imipenem resistance in N. cyriacigeogica is atypical to its drug pattern but has been reported elsewhere. All tested isolates remained susceptible to linezolid with only 0.7% exhibiting resistance to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid and amikacin remain as good empiric option for nocardiosis treatment. Routine susceptibility testing for Nocardia is advisable with the detection of sulphonamide resistance and atypical antibiograms in this study."

RESULTS: From 1 to 20 cases per hospital and from 6 to 9 cases per year were observed. COPD, bronchiectasis and asthma were the main respiratory underlying predisposing conditions. Thirty-four patients were receiving systemic and/or inhaled corticosteroids prior to infection, 8 had neoplasias and 6 hematologic malignancies. Clinical and radiological findings were common to pneumonia of other infectious aetiologies except for the frequent presence of nodules and cavitation. Overall 1 year mortality (38.2%) was high, in 15 patients (27.3%) directly related to the pulmonary disease. The most frequently-identified species were N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 21), N. abscessus (n = 8), and N. farcinica (n = 5). All Nocardia isolates were linezolid-susceptible and all but two amikacin- and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-susceptible.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively review clinical course and outcome of nocardiosis in solid organ recipients at our centre. Five cases of nocardiosis were identified in a series of more than 4000 consecutive solid organ transplants performed at Innsbruck university hospital during a 25-year period. Of the five patients with nocardiosis, two had undergone multivisceral, one liver, one kidney and one lung transplantation. Three patients with Nocardia asteroides infection were treated successfully and recovered from their infectious disease, however, one lost his renal graft following withdrawal of immunosuppression. The lung recipient recovered from nocardiosis but died later on from Pseudomonas pneumonia. One multivisceral recipient died from Nocardia farcinica-disseminated infection. Nocardiosis is a rare, difficult-to-diagnose-and-treat complication following solid organ transplantation. Intestinal recipients might be at increased risk to develop this infection."

She reported having productive coughs, unwanted weight loss and subfebrile temperature in the preceding 3 months. She was known to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with corticoids given systemically and by inhalation. She was a heavy smoker. INVESTIGATIONS: Computed tomography revealed a left apical lung abscess. In the further course of the disease magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated multiple abscesses in both cerebral hemispheres and an abscess, 3.4 cm in diameter, in the right side of the cerebellum, as well as a intra-orbital tumor on the right. Needle aspirate of the eyeball grew Nocardia farcinica. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Over 3 weeks antimicrobial treatment was given with imipenem and amikacin, followed by oral cotrimoxazole for 12 months. The abscesses completely regressed and after 12 months no recurrence was demonstrated either radiologically or clinically. CONCLUSION: Although nocardiasis is rare in Germany it must be included in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia with abscesses. This is especially so if acid-fast bacilli are found. As the resistance pattern of N. farcinica to antibiotics varies, early treatment is essential with antibiotics to which it is sensitive."

Most cases occur in immunocompromised patients, and a delay in establishing the diagnosis is common due to the non-specific clinical presentations and the difficulty in cultivating Nocardia. Although the majority of pulmonary nocardiosis cases are caused by Nocardia asteroides, cases of human infection due to N. farcinica are increasingly diagnosed due to recent developments in taxonomy and diagnostic methods. N. farcinica is a separate species from N. asteroides and appears to be more virulent and resistant to antibiotics. Herein, we describe the case of a 65-year-old HIV-negative immunocompromised patient with a fulminant bilateral pulmonary nocardiosis while on empirical treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and imipenem.

METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study (1:2 ratio) between January 1995 and December 2005. Control subjects were matched for transplant type and timing. Univariate matched odds ratios were determined and conditional logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of all case patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Among 5126 organ transplant recipients, 35 (0.6%) were identified as having cases of Nocardia infection. The highest frequency was among recipients of lung transplants (18 [3.5%] of 521 patients), followed by recipients of heart (10 [2.5%] of 392), intestinal (2 [1.3%] of 155), kidney (3 [0.2%] of 1717), and liver (2 [0.1%] of 1840) transplants. In a comparison of case patients with 70 matched control subjects, receipt of high-dose steroids (odds ratio, 27; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-235; P=.003) and cytomegalovirus disease (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-46; P=.047) in the preceding 6 months and a high median calcineurin inhibitor level in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-22; P=.012) were found to be independent risk factors for Nocardia infection. The majority of case patients (27 [77%] of 35) had pulmonary disease only. Seven transplant recipients (20%) had disseminated disease. Nocardia nova was the most common species (found in 17 [49%] of the patients), followed by Nocardia farcinica (9 [28%]), Nocardia asteroides (8 [23%]), and Nocardia brasiliensis (1 [3%]). Of the 35 case patients, 24 (69%) were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Thirty-one case patients (89%) experienced cure of their Nocardia infection. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of high-dose steroids, history of cytomegalovirus disease, and high levels of calcineurin inhibitors are independent risk factors for Nocardia infection in organ transplant recipients. Our study provides insights into the epidemiology of Nocardia infection in the current era, a period in which immunosuppressive and prophylactic regimens have greatly evolved."

They may be mistaken for gliomas or necrotic metastases, and surgical intervention may be required to make the diagnosis. We report the first case of Nocardia farcinica cerebellar abscess in a patient without immunosuppression. He presented to us with headache and instability beginning a week before. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic lesion located at the right cerebellar hemisphere, hypointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2, with a fine wall that enhanced after injection of gadolinium. Image tests also showed a cavitated lesion at the upper lobule of the right lung. The patient underwent craniotomy and drainage of the cerebellar abscess. Initial post-operative treatment with linezolid produced a limited response. He was re-operated and vancomycin, imipenem and ciprofloxacin were added with an excellent outcome of the cerebellar and lung lesions."

In this study, we identified NTM species of the clinical isolates from 8 provinces in China, in order to preliminarily provide some basic scientific data in the different species and distribution of NTM related to pulmonary disease in China. A total of 523 clinical isolates from patients with tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed clinically from 2005 to 2012 were identified to the species using conventional and molecular methods, including multilocus PCR, rpoB and hsp65 PCR-PRA, hsp65, rpoB, and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region sequencing. The isolates were identified into 3 bacterium genera, including NTM, Gordonia bronchialis, and Nocardia farcinica, and, for the 488 NTM isolates, 27 species were identified. For all the 27 species of NTM which were found to cause pulmonary infections in humans, the most prevalent species was M. intracellulare, followed by M. avium and M. abscessus. And seven other species were for the first time identified in patients with TB in China. NTM species identification is very important for distinguishing between tuberculosis and NTM pulmonary diseases, and the species diversity drives the creation of diverse and integrated identification methods with higher accuracy and efficacy."

Some Nocardia species can infect humans, mainly by airborne transmission. Several reports describe disseminated infections, which are rare and mostly affect strongly immunocompromised patients because intact T-cell-mediated immunity is the major protective mechanism. CASE REPORT: We report a case of disseminated pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous infection with Nocardia farcinica in a 66-year-old kidney transplant recipient treated with low-dose triple immunosuppression. The patient was initially admitted because of severe hyponatremia and pneumonia with radiologic signs of pleural effusion. The infectious agent was isolated when cutaneous lesions developed. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment led to severe hyponatremia; therefore, long-term treatment with parenteral amikacin and minocycline was initiated. After 7 months of consistent intravenous treatment, the lesions completely resolved and treatment was stopped, against some expert suggestions. The patient had remained free of relapse at the time of writing. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated Nocardia infection in immunocompromised patients is a rare but life-threatening disease. Owing to its infrequency, the variety of clinical patterns, antimicrobial resistance, and often fatal complications of standardized therapy, the diagnosis and treatment of this infection remain challenging and protracted."

Methods: Over a 10 year period (2005-14), 1119 Nocardia strains were molecularly identified and subjected to the Etest. The distribution and resistance trends over the sub-periods 2005-09 and 2010-14 were also examined. Results: Of the strains examined, 82.9% belonged to the following species: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (25.3%), Nocardia nova (15.0%), Nocardia abscessus (12.7%), Nocardia farcinica (11.4%), Nocardia carnea (4.3%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.5%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (3.1%), Nocardia flavorosea (2.6%), Nocardia rhamnosiphila (2.6%) and Nocardia transvalensis (2.4%). Their prevalence values were similar during 2005-09 and 2010-14, except for those of N. abscessus , N. farcinica and N. transvalensis , which fell significantly in the second sub-period ( P &lt;=  0.05). The major location of isolation was the respiratory tract (~86%). Half (13/27) of all strains from the CNS were N. farcinica . Significant differences in MIC results were recorded for some species between the two sub-periods. According to the CLSI's breakpoints, low resistance rates (&lt;=15%) were recorded for seven species with respect to cefotaxime, imipenem and tobramycin; five species showed similar rates with respect to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Linezolid and amikacin were the most frequently active agents. Conclusion: The accurate identification of the infecting species and the determination of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, given the large number of strains with atypical patterns, are crucial if patients with nocardiosis are to be successfully treated."

The epidemiology and clinical presentation could change with the increasing number of immunocompromised patients. METHODS: The medical records and microbiological data of patients affected by nocardiosis and treated at the university hospitals of Marseille between 2004 and 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The cases of 34 patients infected by Nocardia spp during this period were analyzed. The main underlying conditions were transplantation (n=15), malignancy (n=9), cystic fibrosis (n=4), and immune disease (n=3); no immunodeficiency condition was observed for three patients. No case of AIDS was observed. At diagnosis, 61.8% had received steroids for over 3 months. Four clinical presentations were identified, depending on the underlying condition: the disseminated form (50.0%) and the visceral isolated form (26.5%) in severely immunocompromised patients, the bronchial form (14.7%) in patients with chronic lung disease, and the cutaneous isolated form (8.8%) in immunocompetent patients. Nocardia farcinica was the main species identified (26.5%). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was prescribed in 68.0% of patients, and 38.0% underwent surgery. Mortality was 11.7%, and the patients who died had disseminated or visceral nocardiosis.

Disseminated infection caused by Nocardia species is rare and occurs primarily in immunosuppressed patients. Signs and symptoms of this infection are frequently nonspecific making early diagnosis and treatment difficult. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of subcutaneous and pulmonary nocardiosis due to Nocardia farcinica (N farcinica) in a patient with nephrotic syndrome who is undergoing long-term corticosteroid therapy. In this patient, systemic and pulmonary symptoms (usually found in nocaria infection) such as fever, cough, and expectoration were absent. DIAGNOSES: Early diagnosis was made by pus culture from subcutaneous abscesses and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which confirm the diagnosis of N farcinica infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with combination therapy of cefatriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 2 weeks, and the treatment with TMP-SMX continued to 6 months. OUTCOMES: The abscesses were cured in 4 weeks and a lesion in the upper lobe of left lung resolved in 3 months. LESSONS: This case indicates that disseminated infection due to N farcinica could occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome, even during the period of maintenance therapy with a low-dose corticosteroid and common signs and symptoms of infections could be absent."

This study was performed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary nocardiosis in Japan. Methods The patients definitively diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis at our hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Results Nineteen men and 11 women (30 in total) were diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. Almost all patients were complicated by a non-pulmonary underlying disease, such as malignant tumor or collagen vascular disease, or pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumonia, and 13 patients (43.3%) were treated with steroids or immunosuppressors. Gram staining was performed in 29 patients, and a characteristic Gram-positive rod was detected in 28 patients (96.6%). Thirty-one strains of Nocardia were isolated and identified. Seven strains of Nocardia farcinica were isolated as the most frequent species, followed by Nocardia nova isolated from 6 patients. Seventeen patients died, giving a crude morality rate of 56.7% and a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%. The 1-year survival rates in the groups with and without immunosuppressant agents were 41.7% and 59.7%, respectively, showing that the outcome of those receiving immunosuppressants tended to be poorer than those not receiving them. Conclusion Pulmonary nocardiosis developed as an opportunistic infection in most cases. The outcome was relatively poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%, and it was particularly poor in patients treated with immunosuppressant agents. Pulmonary nocardiosis should always be considered in patients presenting with an opportunistic respiratory infection, and an early diagnosis requires sample collection and Gram staining."

With the increasing use of new immunosuppressant drugs, the incidence of opportunistic or atypical infections is also increasing, including with Nocardia spp. A high level of awareness of atypical infections is warranted in immunosuppressed patients. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old female African American, with a past medical history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and arthritis, was treated with infliximab and prednisone. She presented to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, and a two-week history of a productive cough. Examination showed hypoxia, tachypnea, decreased and coarse bilateral breath sounds, and fluctuant, tender, erythematous masses on her trunk and groin. Laboratory investigations showed a leukocytosis with a left shift. She was initially treated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, blood cultures grew Nocardia farcinica and treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was begun, which was complicated by severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Following recovery from infection and resolution of the hyponatremia, the patient was discharged to a senior care facility, but with continued treatment with TMP-SMX. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first case of disseminated nocardiosis associated with infliximab treatment in a patient with ulcerative colitis. As with other forms of immunosuppressive therapy, patients who are treated with infliximab should be followed closely due to the increased risk of atypical infections. When initiating antibiotic therapy, careful monitoring of possible side effects should be done."

Inhalation is the primary route for exposure via dust particles. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are at increased risk of disseminated disease. A challenge in the diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is that it can mimic other pulmonary diseases. Nocardia farcinica tends to be a more virulent, multidrug-resistant strain with an increased tendency to disseminate. This report describes a 64-year-old man with AIDS found to have pulmonary nocardiosis that did not respond to standard antibiotic therapy. Further evaluation revealed the virulent, multidrug-resistant Nocardia farcinica species. Targeted antibiotic therapy was initiated, after which the patient had an improvement in pulmonary symptoms. It is important to suspect pulmonary nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients who fail to respond to standard antimicrobial therapy. Susceptibilities should be obtained so that appropriate therapy can be promptly initiated as Nocardia farcinica is highly resistant to multiple antimicrobials."

Accurate microbiological data are essential to guide antibiotic treatment. Our primary objective was to describe species identification and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for Nocardia isolates analysed over a 6-year period. Secondary objectives were to study temporal trends in species distribution and AST results. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed results from Nocardia isolates sent between January 2010 and December 2015 to a French laboratory dedicated to Nocardia (Observatoire Francais des Nocardioses). Species identification was obtained by amplification and sequencing of a 600-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene (for all isolates) and of hsp65 (when required). AST was performed using disk diffusion. RESULTS: We included 793 Nocardia isolates, mostly from the lungs (53.8%). The most frequent species were Nocardia farcinica (20.2%), Nocardia abscessus complex (19.9%) and Nocardia nova complex (19.5%). The proportion of N. farcinica increased significantly over time from 13% in 2010 to 27.6% in 2014. Linezolid, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and imipenem were the most frequently identified active antibiotics with, respectively, 0% (0/734), 2.9% (21/730), 5.4% (40/734), 9.4% (69/734) and 19.5% (143/732) of isolates not susceptible. Nocardia farcinica was frequently not susceptible to cefotaxime (118/148, 79.7% of the isolates), but only about 5% of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica and N. abscessus complex isolates were not susceptible to cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: In this first epidemiological study of Nocardia isolated from human samples in France, N. farcinica was the species most frequently identified and its prevalence increased over time."

Most of our knowledge on PN is derived from case reports and small case series. Increasing incidence rates of PN have been reported recently. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course of and risk factors for PN in four Western European countries and to estimate population-based annual hospitalization rates. METHODS: This was a retrospective evaluation (1995-2011) of the clinical course of and risk factors for PN in patients at 11 hospitals in four European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands). Population-based estimates of hospitalization rates for PN in Germany (2005 to 2011) were calculated using official German nationwide diagnosis-related groups (DRG) hospital statistics. RESULTS: Forty-three patients fulfilled stringent criteria for proven (n=8) and probable (n=35) PN; seven had extrapulmonary dissemination. For these 43 patients, the major risk factors for PN were immunocompromising (83.7%) and/or pulmonary (58.1%; as only comorbidity in 27.9%) comorbidities. The median duration of PN targeted therapy was 12 weeks. Distinctive patterns of resistance were observed (imipenem susceptibility: Nocardia farcinica 33.3%; Nocardia asteroides 66.7%). The overall mortality rate was 18.9% (50% in disseminated PN). Over time, annual PN hospitalization rates remained unchanged at around 0.04/100000, with the highest rate among men aged 75-84 years (0.24/100000). CONCLUSIONS: PN is a rare, but potentially life-threatening disease, and mainly affects immunocompromised elderly males. Overall, annual hospitalization rates remained stable between 2005 and 2011."

Its epidemiological characteristics, including species distribution, clinical features, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, should be under surveillance for the prevention and treatment of nocardiosis. In the present study, over a 9-year period (from 2009 to 2017), 53 non-repetitive Nocardia isolates were collected from 8 tertiary general hospitals of 7 cities in China. These isolates were identified to species level by multilocus sequence analysis(MLSA). The clinical data were also reviewed. The susceptibilities to 10 commonly-used antibiotics for Nocardia were determined by E-test stripes, and the resistance rates, MIC50 and MIC90 to each antibiotic by different species were analyzed. Of 53 Nocardia isolates, N. farcinica was the most common species (24.5%, 13/53), followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (20.8%, 11/53), N. terpenica (15.1%, 8/53), N. abscessus (9.43%, 5/53), N. otitidiscaviarum (7.55%, 4/53), respectively. Furthermore, 31 Nocardia (58.5%) isolates were recovered from lower respiratory tract (sputum and BALF), 15 (28.3%) from superficial Infection, 3 (5.7%) from pleural effusion, 2 (3.8%) from CSF, and 1 from bone marrow and 1 from synovial fluid, respectively. The antibiotic resistance profiles varied between different Nocardia species. All Nocardia isolates were susceptible to linezolid, followed by imipenem and amikacin (both 92.5% susceptibility rate). N. terpenica, rarely documented elsewhere, showed a different antimicrobial susceptibility profile. In summary, herein, the clinical and antibiotic resistance features of Nocardia species reported would be helpful for understanding the diversity of Nocardia species circulating in China and for decision making in the context of empiric therapy."

We report an 11-year-old female who developed nocardia abscesses of the abdomen post-RT. ESRD was secondary to FSGS and she had received multiple immunosuppressive agents prior to transplant. Induction immunosuppression consisted of thymoglobulin and maintenance was with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone. There were construction activities in the hospital ward during her hospital stay. Due to immediate recurrence of FSGS in the allograft, she received plasma exchange, rituximab, and IVIG. Anti-infective prophylaxis consisted of TMP-SMX, valganciclovir, and nystatin. She developed multiple loculated fluid collections in the abdomen 6 weeks later. Histology of lesions demonstrated suppurative caseating granulomatous inflammation and the AFB culture showed Nocardia farcinica. With the reduction of immunosuppressive agents along with usage of TMP-SMX, imipenem-cilastatin, and linezolid, she had a partial recovery after 9 months with persistent small abscesses but remained asymptomatic clinically. There was no evidence of nocardia infection in lungs and brain. Repeat AFB culture from the lesions was negative. Allograft function remained stable throughout. She remains on oral TMP-SMX therapy. We postulated that she could have acquired nocardia either from the contaminated air particles in the hospital from the construction activities or reactivation of nocardia from prior colonization.

This study aimed to investigate the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of a large number of contemporary (2011-2016) clinical Nocardia species referred to a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy Nocardia isolates identified to the species level by dual target gene sequencing were investigated. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre  RAPMYCOI panel with the minimum inhibitory concentration and geometric mean obtained for each species and drug combination. The susceptibility profiles and species distribution were analysed. RESULTS: The respiratory system is the most affected site of nocardiosis. N. nova complex was the most frequently isolated Nocardia species (n = 80, 29.6%) in this survey followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 61, 22.6%), N. brasiliensis (n = 52, 19.3%) and N. farcinica (n = 38, 14.1%). Of the tested isolates, 9.3% and 59.3% displayed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem respectively. N. farcinica accounted for the highest number of resistant strains to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. High imipenem resistance in N. cyriacigeogica is atypical to its drug pattern but has been reported elsewhere. All tested isolates remained susceptible to linezolid with only 0.7% exhibiting resistance to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid and amikacin remain as good empiric option for nocardiosis treatment.

We aimed at describing nocardiosis in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). METHODS: This international retrospective cohort included patients with PID and nocardiosis diagnosed and/or published from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016. To identify nocardiosis cases, we analyzed PID databases from the French National Reference Center for PID (Paris, France) and the National Institute of Health (NIH, United States of America) and we performed a literature review on PubMed. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases of nocardiosis associated with PID were included: median age at diagnosis of nocardiosis was 19 (0-56) years and most cases were observed among chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients (87.8%). Median time from symptoms to diagnosis of Nocardia infection was 20 (2-257) days. Most frequent clinical nocardiosis presentation was pneumonia (86.7%). Twelve-month mortality rate was 4.2%, and 11.9% of patients experienced a possible recurrence of infection. Nocardiosis more frequently led to the diagnosis of PID among non-CGD patients than in CGD patients. Non-CGD patients experienced more cerebral nocardiosis and more disseminated infections, but mortality and recurrence rates were similar. Highest incidences of nocardiosis among PID cohorts were observed among CGD patients (0.0057 and 0.0044 cases/patient-year in the USA and in France, respectively), followed by IL-12p40 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Among 49 cases of nocardiosis associated with PID, most patients had CGD and lung involvement. Both mortality and recurrence rates were low."

No controlled studies assessing risk factors for nocardiosis in this high-risk population have been reported. METHODS: Patients undergoing lung transplantation at a single center between 2012-2018 and diagnosed with nocardiosis post-transplant were matched 1:2 to uninfected control subjects on the basis of age, transplant date, and sex. RESULTS: The incidence of nocardiosis in this lung transplant population was 3.4% (20/586), occurring a median of 9.4 months (range 4.4-55.2) post-transplant. In multivariable analysis, consistent use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the 12 weeks prior to diagnosis was independently associated with protection against nocardiosis (OR 0.038; 95% CI 0.01-0.29; p=0.002). Augmented immunosuppression in the 6 months prior to diagnosis was independently associated with the development of nocardiosis (OR 9.94; 95% CI 1.62- 61.00; p=0.013). Six case patients (30%) had disseminated disease; all-cause 6-month mortality was 25%. The most common species was Nocardia farcinica (7/17 isolates), which was associated with dissemination and mortality. The most active antibiotics were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100%), linezolid (100%), and amikacin (76%). Imipenem was only active against 4/17 isolates (24% susceptibility), with two isolates becoming non-susceptible later in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis was shown to be protective against nocardiosis in lung transplant recipients, while augmented immunosuppression conferred increased risk. Institutional epidemiologic data are needed to best guide empiric therapy for Nocardia, as historical in vitro data may not predict local susceptibilities."

Eight juvenile Black Crakes (Limnocoraxflavirostra) died unexpectedly at the Basle Zoo. Necropsy revealed disseminated white, firm nodules, 1-3 mm in diameter, throughout the lung parenchyma. Histologically, the lungs contained multiple, often confluent granulomas with central necrosis. Delicate, gram-positive, 0.5- to 1.0-microm-wide, branching, occasionally beaded, filamentous organisms were visible in necrotic centers. These organisms were acid fast when stained with Fite-Faraco. No histologic lesions were seen in other organs. Nocardia nova was isolated from liver, spleen, kidney, and lung. Granulomatous and necrotizing nocardial pneumonia with agonal septicemia was diagnosed, suggesting an aerogenous infection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported epizootic outbreak of nocardiosis in birds, which is additionally unusual because it was caused by N. nova."

Sepsis occurred about two years after an episode of pulmonary nocardiosis with the same Nocardia species, that was successfully treated by 12 months of antibiotics. A good outcome of the joint infection was observed in response to antibiotics and removal of the prosthesis. Nocardiosis is a rare infection, acting as an opportunistic infection, facilitated in the present case by systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic corticosteroid therapy. Nocardia infections mainly affect the lungs, skin and central nervous system; these last two sites are mostly due to haematogenous spread, a frequent event. Treatment is based on antibiotics, usually continued for 3-12 months, especially because of the risk of relapse. The imipenem-amikacin combination appears to be more effective than trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of Nocardia nova joint prosthesis infection also presenting as late septic spread of pulmonary nocardiosis, complicating corticosteroid-treated systemic lupus erythematosus."

On admission she had a mild cough, and her chest radiography and computed tomography revealed bilateral multiple nodules, some of which were cavitated. She developed a cough productive of yellow sputum and fever up to 38 degrees C. Examination of the sputum revealed a gram-positive branched organism and sputum cultures repeatedly grew Nocardia species. The isolate was identified as Nocardia nova later. Clinical recovery was obtained readily upon treatment with imipenem and trimethoprim methoxazole, though the latter drug was discontinued because of nausea and anorexia. This drug was therefore replaced with oral minocycline, which proved to be ineffective clinically although susceptibility testing of the drug showed positive sensitivity. Minocycline was replaced with clarithromycin, after which chest radiography and computed tomography showed almost total resolution of the infiltrates. Clarithromycin may be an alternative oral agent to sulfonamides or minocycline when these agents are ineffective or not tolerated."

A 27-year-old man with hemophilia A was admitted on October 17, 2000, with fever and dyspnea. CD4 cell counts were 5/microl on admission. Prophylaxis against PCP was administered by inhalation of pentamidine isethionate because he was allergic to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP). He was diagnosed with PCP from chest X-ray and bronchoalveolar lavage. The sputum obtained for culture on admission was positive for Gram-positive branching rods; the organism was later identified as Nocardia nova. He died from respiratory failure on November 7, 2000.

Three patient isolates and the type strain of N. veterana gave identical and distinctive restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for an amplified portion of the 16S rRNA gene. These three isolates and the N. veterana type strain also gave identical RFLPs for an amplified portion of the 65-kDa heat shock protein gene, but this pattern was identical to that obtained for the Nocardia nova type strain. Sequence analysis of both a 1,359-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene and a 441-bp region of the heat shock protein gene of the patient isolates showed 100% identities with the same regions of the N. veterana type strain. DNA-DNA hybridization of the DNA of one of the patient isolates with the DNA of the N. veterana type strain showed a relative binding ratio of 82%, with 0% divergence, confirming that the isolate was N. veterana. Biochemical and susceptibility testing showed no significant differences among the patient isolates and the N. veterana type strain. Significantly, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing obtained for our isolates were similar to those obtained for N. nova, indicating that susceptibility testing alone cannot discriminate between these species. We present two case studies which show that N. veterana is a causative agent of pulmonary disease in immunocompromised patients residing in North America. We also describe difficulties encountered in using 16S rRNA gene sequences alone for discrimination of N. veterana from the related species Nocardia africana and N. nova because of the very high degree of 16S rRNA gene similarity among them."

METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study (1:2 ratio) between January 1995 and December 2005. Control subjects were matched for transplant type and timing. Univariate matched odds ratios were determined and conditional logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of all case patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Among 5126 organ transplant recipients, 35 (0.6%) were identified as having cases of Nocardia infection. The highest frequency was among recipients of lung transplants (18 [3.5%] of 521 patients), followed by recipients of heart (10 [2.5%] of 392), intestinal (2 [1.3%] of 155), kidney (3 [0.2%] of 1717), and liver (2 [0.1%] of 1840) transplants. In a comparison of case patients with 70 matched control subjects, receipt of high-dose steroids (odds ratio, 27; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-235; P=.003) and cytomegalovirus disease (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-46; P=.047) in the preceding 6 months and a high median calcineurin inhibitor level in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-22; P=.012) were found to be independent risk factors for Nocardia infection. The majority of case patients (27 [77%] of 35) had pulmonary disease only. Seven transplant recipients (20%) had disseminated disease. Nocardia nova was the most common species (found in 17 [49%] of the patients), followed by Nocardia farcinica (9 [28%]), Nocardia asteroides (8 [23%]), and Nocardia brasiliensis (1 [3%]). Of the 35 case patients, 24 (69%) were receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Thirty-one case patients (89%) experienced cure of their Nocardia infection. CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of high-dose steroids, history of cytomegalovirus disease, and high levels of calcineurin inhibitors are independent risk factors for Nocardia infection in organ transplant recipients.

Cutaneous-subcutaneous, pulmonary and systemic signs are observed in feline nocardiosis. However, osteomyelitis is a rare clinical manifestation in cats. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly N. asteroides sensu stricto), Nocardia brasiliensis, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia nova are the most common pathogenic species identified in cats, based on recent molecular classification (16S rRNA gene). The present report is, to our knowledge, the first case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a cat caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of methods, including molecular techniques. CASE PRESENTATION: A one-year-old non-neutered female cat, raised in a rural area, was admitted to the Companion Animal Hospital-PUCPR, Sao Jose dos Pinhais, State of Parana, Brazil, with a history a progressive facial lesion, difficulty apprehending food, loss of appetite, apathy and emaciation. Clinical examination showed fever, submandibular lymphadenitis, and a painless, 8 cm diameter mass, which was irregularly-shaped, of firm consistency, and located in the region of the left mandible. The skin around the lesion was friable, with diffuse inflammation (cellulitis), multiple draining sinuses, and exudation of serosanguinous material containing whitish ""sulfur"" granules.Diagnosis was based initially in clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological, and histopathological findings, and radiographic images. Molecular sequencing of 16S rRNA of isolate allowed diagnosis of Nocardia africana. Despite supportive care and antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing the animal died. CONCLUSION: The present report describes a rare clinical case of feline osteomyelitis caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological and histopathological findings, radiographic images, and molecular methods.

The incidence of nocardiosis varies geographically according to several factors, such as the prevalence of HIV infections, transplants, neoplastic and rheumatic diseases, as well as climate, socio-economic conditions and laboratory procedures for Nocardia detection and identification. In Brazil the paucity of clinical reports of Nocardia infections suggests that this genus may be underestimated as a cause of human diseases and/or either neglected or misidentified in laboratory specimens. Accurate identification of Nocardia species has become increasingly important for clinical and epidemiological investigations. In this study, seven clinical Nocardia isolates were identified by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and their antimicrobial susceptibility was also determined. Most Nocardia isolates were associated to pulmonary disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of Brazilian human isolates in cases reported in literature were identified as Nocardia sp. Molecular characterization was used for species identification of Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia asiatica and Nocardia exalbida/gamkensis. Data indicated that molecular analysis provided a different Nocardia speciation than the initial biochemical identification for most Brazilian isolates. All Nocardia isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobial of choice in the treatment nocardiosis. N. nova isolated from different clinical specimens from one patient showed identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and two distinct clones. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country in terms of land mass and population, pulmonary, extrapulmonary and systemic forms of nocardiosis were reported in only 6 of the 26 Brazilian states from 1970 to 2013. A least 33.8% of these 46 cases of nocardiosis proved fatal. Interestingly, coinfection by two clones may occur in patients presenting nocardiosis. Nocardia infection may be more common throughout the Brazilian territory and in other developing tropical countries than is currently recognized and MLSA should be used more extensively as an effective method for Nocardia identification."

METHODS: We determined the species and drug susceptibility of 138 Nocardia strains isolated from 132 patients at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) from 2002 through 2012 and analyzed the clinical features. RESULTS: The 132 patients included 82 men and 50 women with a mean age of 59.1 years. All except two had underlying cancer, and 47 (35.6%) also received a stem cell transplant. These patients experienced 136 episodes of Nocardia infection, including pulmonary infection, abscess of deep skin and soft tissue, bacteremia and dissemination, and brain abscess. The 138 Nocardia strains involved 27 species, of which 20 species have been described since 2000. Common species included Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia farcinica, and Nocardia abscessus, together accounting for 59.4%. N nova caused most bacteremia cases, whereas N farcinica caused most of the skin and brain infections. Infections with a few recent species likely represented first confirmation or report of human infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of 117 strains showed that they were all susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and linezolid but variably susceptible to other drugs depending on species. Most patients who were treated for the infection showed improvement or resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse Nocardia species can cause secondary infections in patients with cancer. Timely species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests may guide treatment."

The authors report a case of sphenoid sinusitis complicated by infratemporal fossa abscess, which raised several diagnostic problems. CASE REPORT: The patient was referred with temporal headache, subacute trigeminal neuralgia and subsequent infectious syndrome. Computed tomography imaging revealed left sphenoid sinusitis with osteolysis and infratemporal fossa abscess, as well as suspicious lung nodules suggestive of the initial site of infection. Bacteriological specimens obtained by endoscopic sphenoidotomy confirmed the presence of Nocardia nova. A favourable outcome was observed in response to targeted antibiotic therapy. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Sphenoid sinusitis with infratemporal fossa abscess is an exceptional mode of presentation of nocardiosis, illustrating the polymorphic clinical features of this disease. Bacteriological examination of samples taken directly from the organ concerned, in this case, by sphenoidotomy, is the only formal diagnostic criterion. Antibiotic therapy with intravenous imipenem/amikacin, followed by oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim Forte( )) for several months, is the key to successful management."

Clinical manifestations range from localized skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening pulmonary, central nervous system, and/or disseminated infections. Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for nocardiosis, and further data in regard to characteristics of disease in this population are warranted. METHODS: We performed retrospective chart review of patients post allogeneic HSCT at Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida diagnosed with nocardiosis from 2003 to 2013. RESULTS: In a decade, 15 cases of nocardiosis were identified. The majority of patients were men (11/15). The median age was 55 years (range 25-65). The most common type of transplant was matched-related donor (n = 8), followed by matched-unrelated donor (n = 3), mismatched-unrelated donor (n = 3), and double umbilical cord (n = 1). Ten received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens. Twelve of 15 patients were on prednisone, 10 of which were on a total daily dose &gt;=20 mg. The median time from transplant to first positive culture was 10 months (range 1.5-93). Pulmonary nocardiosis was the most prevalent manifestation at 87%. Disseminated disease (2 or more sites of infection) was seen in 47%, whereas blood cultures were positive in 27% of the total cohort. The most common species was Nocardia nova (n = 4). At the time of diagnosis, 20% of the patients were receiving prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Susceptibility data were available for 8 patients: all 8 samples were susceptible to TMP-SMX. Nocardiosis was treated with 2 or more active drugs in 93% of the patients. Overall mortality was 53%, with nocardiosis attributed as the cause in 62.5% (5/8). The absolute lymphocyte count at time of diagnoses was significantly lower in patients who ultimately experienced treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Infection with Nocardia species in allogeneic HSCT recipients appears to be a late complication of transplantation and most commonly involves the lung. Two-thirds of the cohort received a MAC regimen and the majority of the patients were receiving steroids at the time of diagnosis. Most patients were not receiving TMP-SMX for PJP prophylaxis at the time of nocardiosis diagnosis, and TMP-SMX may therefore have a protective effect."

It is also known to occur in immunocompetent patients (ICPs). However, little is currently known regarding the clinical characteristics and radiographic findings of pulmonary nocardiosis specifically in ICPs. In this study, 30 patients with pulmonary nocardiosis were identified and 10 were considered to be colonized. Of all patients with pulmonary nocardiosis, 12 patients were ICPs and 18 were ISPs. Although half of ISPs were infected by Nocardia nova, ICPs were affected by various Nocardia species. Compared with ISPs, chest CT findings of ICPs showed a higher prevalence of bronchiectasis (67% vs 6%, p &lt; .01) and centrilobular nodular opacities (67% vs 11%, p &lt; .01), both of which are often seen in pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease. Additionally, nontuberculous mycobacterium was isolated from 6 of 21 ICPs with positive Nocardia species culture. Therefore, we recommend that physicians carefully differentiate pulmonary nocardiosis from pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease in ICPs."

Methods: Over a 10 year period (2005-14), 1119 Nocardia strains were molecularly identified and subjected to the Etest. The distribution and resistance trends over the sub-periods 2005-09 and 2010-14 were also examined. Results: Of the strains examined, 82.9% belonged to the following species: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (25.3%), Nocardia nova (15.0%), Nocardia abscessus (12.7%), Nocardia farcinica (11.4%), Nocardia carnea (4.3%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.5%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (3.1%), Nocardia flavorosea (2.6%), Nocardia rhamnosiphila (2.6%) and Nocardia transvalensis (2.4%). Their prevalence values were similar during 2005-09 and 2010-14, except for those of N. abscessus , N. farcinica and N. transvalensis , which fell significantly in the second sub-period ( P &lt;=  0.05). The major location of isolation was the respiratory tract (~86%). Half (13/27) of all strains from the CNS were N. farcinica . Significant differences in MIC results were recorded for some species between the two sub-periods. According to the CLSI's breakpoints, low resistance rates (&lt;=15%) were recorded for seven species with respect to cefotaxime, imipenem and tobramycin; five species showed similar rates with respect to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Linezolid and amikacin were the most frequently active agents. Conclusion: The accurate identification of the infecting species and the determination of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, given the large number of strains with atypical patterns, are crucial if patients with nocardiosis are to be successfully treated."

This study was performed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary nocardiosis in Japan. Methods The patients definitively diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis at our hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Results Nineteen men and 11 women (30 in total) were diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. Almost all patients were complicated by a non-pulmonary underlying disease, such as malignant tumor or collagen vascular disease, or pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumonia, and 13 patients (43.3%) were treated with steroids or immunosuppressors. Gram staining was performed in 29 patients, and a characteristic Gram-positive rod was detected in 28 patients (96.6%). Thirty-one strains of Nocardia were isolated and identified. Seven strains of Nocardia farcinica were isolated as the most frequent species, followed by Nocardia nova isolated from 6 patients. Seventeen patients died, giving a crude morality rate of 56.7% and a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%. The 1-year survival rates in the groups with and without immunosuppressant agents were 41.7% and 59.7%, respectively, showing that the outcome of those receiving immunosuppressants tended to be poorer than those not receiving them. Conclusion Pulmonary nocardiosis developed as an opportunistic infection in most cases. The outcome was relatively poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%, and it was particularly poor in patients treated with immunosuppressant agents. Pulmonary nocardiosis should always be considered in patients presenting with an opportunistic respiratory infection, and an early diagnosis requires sample collection and Gram staining."

The most frequent portals of entry are the respiratory tract by inhalation or direct inoculation through a cutaneous effraction. Nocardiosis may be localised or disseminated. CASE REPORT: We report a rare case of disseminated nocardiosis to Nocardia nova with pulmonary, cutaneous, cerebral attacks and femoral osteomyelitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by prolonged cultures of the bronchoalveolar fluid and the pus extracted from a cutaneous lesion. The outcome was favorable under adapted and prolonged antibiotherapy with imipenem and amikacine and then cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSION: This observation is original because it involves a immunocompetent patient with an association of two exceptional locations for N. nova: brain abscesses and femoral osteomyelitis. Screening for cerebral involvement should be systematic, even in the lack of neurological signs. An adapted and prolonged antibiotherapy must be conducted."

Accurate microbiological data are essential to guide antibiotic treatment. Our primary objective was to describe species identification and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for Nocardia isolates analysed over a 6-year period. Secondary objectives were to study temporal trends in species distribution and AST results. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed results from Nocardia isolates sent between January 2010 and December 2015 to a French laboratory dedicated to Nocardia (Observatoire Francais des Nocardioses). Species identification was obtained by amplification and sequencing of a 600-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene (for all isolates) and of hsp65 (when required). AST was performed using disk diffusion. RESULTS: We included 793 Nocardia isolates, mostly from the lungs (53.8%). The most frequent species were Nocardia farcinica (20.2%), Nocardia abscessus complex (19.9%) and Nocardia nova complex (19.5%). The proportion of N. farcinica increased significantly over time from 13% in 2010 to 27.6% in 2014. Linezolid, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and imipenem were the most frequently identified active antibiotics with, respectively, 0% (0/734), 2.9% (21/730), 5.4% (40/734), 9.4% (69/734) and 19.5% (143/732) of isolates not susceptible. Nocardia farcinica was frequently not susceptible to cefotaxime (118/148, 79.7% of the isolates), but only about 5% of Nocardia cyriacigeorgica and N. abscessus complex isolates were not susceptible to cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: In this first epidemiological study of Nocardia isolated from human samples in France, N. farcinica was the species most frequently identified and its prevalence increased over time."

AIM: To describe the epidemiology, diagnosis and initial treatment of nocardiosis in an Australian tertiary hospital over 7 years. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all positive cultures for Nocardia species from any site isolated at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 were identified, and corresponding laboratory data and medical records reviewed. RESULTS: Sixty-eight non-duplicate isolates were identified from 67 patients. Common predisposing factors were chronic lung disease (38/67; 57%), organ, particularly lung, transplantation (13/67; 19%) and solid organ malignancy (6/67; 9%); 12% (8/67) of patients had no identifiable systemic risk factors. Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had pulmonary nocardiosis only. Nocardia nova was the most commonly isolated species (20/68; 29%). In 48% (32/67) of patients, Nocardia species were isolated only on specific mycobacterial media. All tested species were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and amikacin, with the majority (58/63; 92%) susceptible to imipenem. All-cause mortality rates at 6 and 12 months where data were available were 15% (10/66 patients) and 22% (14/64 patients) respectively. CONCLUSION: In the largest Australian series in 25 years, nocardiosis predominantly affected patients with chronic lung disease or impaired cell-mediated immunity. A significant proportion of organisms from pulmonary sites were isolated on mycobacterial culture media only, suggesting that its use may improve yield. Isolates remain highly susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, amikacin and imipenem, while other agents should be used only after confirmation of in vitro susceptibility."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric retrospective analysis of patients presenting with Nocardia-positive biological sample from January 1, 1998 to May 1, 2017. RESULTS: We identified nine cases of Nocardia infections. Risk factors were oral corticosteroid therapy (n=3), solid cancer (n=2), hematological cancer (n=1), COPD (n=1). No risk factor was identified in patients with isolated cutaneous presentation (n=2). Disseminated presentations (n=3) were observed in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (n=2) and presenting with ENT cancer (n=1). Identified Nocardia species were Nocardia nova (n=4), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia abscessus (n=1), Nocardia brasiliensis (n=1), and Nocardia asteroides (n=1). The median diagnostic time was 17 days. Antibiotic therapy was prolonged and included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 6/9 cases. The overall one-year case fatality was high (3/8). No recurrence was observed. We identified two cases of respiratory colonization with N. abscessus and N. cyriacigeorgica in COPD patients. CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis can occur both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. It is a severe infection, with a miscellaneous clinical spectrum and complex treatments.

Nocardiosis in birds is uncommon. Laboratory identification of Nocardia to the species level is difficult by traditional phenotypic methods based on biochemical reactions and hydrolysis tests, and is most accurately performed by sequencing multiple gene targets. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of fatal Nocardia nova infection in a yellow-bibbed lory nestling in an oceanarium diagnosed by multilocus sequencing. Necropsy examination showed effacement of normal sternal musculature with yellowish, firm aberrant material, and diffuse infiltration of the lungs with nodular, tan to yellow foci. Histologically, severe granulomatous inflammation with marked necrosis was observed in the lung, spleen and sternal musculature. Fine, sometimes Gram-positive, 0.5-1 mum wide, branching and beaded filamentous organisms were visible within the lesions. They were acid-fast on Fite-Faraco stain. Tissue samples obtained from the sternum, liver, right lung and right kidney recovered Nocardia species. Sequencing of four gene loci and phylogenetic analysis of concatenated (gyrB-16S-secA1-hsp65) sequences revealed that the isolate was N. nova. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of N. nova infection in yellow-bibbed lorry (Lorius chlorocercus). The present case is the first one of which the species identity of the isolate was determined by multilocus sequencing.

Infection can be localized or disseminated, affecting skin and soft tissues, the respiratory system, bones and joints, the circulatory system and especially the central nervous system. Ocular infections such as keratitis, scleritis, conjunctivitis, dacryocystitis, orbital cellulitis and endophthalmitis due to Nocardia spp. are infrequently reported, and usually described after penetrating corneal trauma or ocular contact with plants and soils. Case presentation: An immunocompetent male presented with a history of penetrating ocular trauma that had evolved to infectious endophthalmitis, which was refractory to different antibiotic treatments. No micro-organisms were isolated from repeated conjunctival smear and corneal scraping cultures between the ocular trauma (August 2014) and the endophthalmitis diagnosis (November 2015). After this period, N. nova sensu stricto was isolated in aqueous humour aspirate. Treatment was adjusted and clinical improvement was obtained after an adequate microbiological procedure, including an optimal sampling and an antimicrobial-susceptibility testing report.

This study aimed to investigate the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of a large number of contemporary (2011-2016) clinical Nocardia species referred to a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy Nocardia isolates identified to the species level by dual target gene sequencing were investigated. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Sensititre  RAPMYCOI panel with the minimum inhibitory concentration and geometric mean obtained for each species and drug combination. The susceptibility profiles and species distribution were analysed. RESULTS: The respiratory system is the most affected site of nocardiosis. N. nova complex was the most frequently isolated Nocardia species (n = 80, 29.6%) in this survey followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 61, 22.6%), N. brasiliensis (n = 52, 19.3%) and N. farcinica (n = 38, 14.1%). Of the tested isolates, 9.3% and 59.3% displayed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem respectively. N. farcinica accounted for the highest number of resistant strains to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. High imipenem resistance in N. cyriacigeogica is atypical to its drug pattern but has been reported elsewhere. All tested isolates remained susceptible to linezolid with only 0.7% exhibiting resistance to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid and amikacin remain as good empiric option for nocardiosis treatment. Routine susceptibility testing for Nocardia is advisable with the detection of sulphonamide resistance and atypical antibiograms in this study."

OBJECTIVE: To study the predisposing factors, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment and progress of pulmonary nocardiosis (PN). METHODS: Review of 10 patients (9 male, 1 female, mean age 61) with PN in a 600-bed teaching hospital, diagnosed from 1992 to 1999. RESULTS: Associated diseases observed were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 6 patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 3 and polymyalgia rheumatica in 1. Four patients had received oral corticotherapy for COPD for over a year (mean dose 13 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). The main reason for consultation was an increase in dyspnea in the patients with COPD (6/6) and fever in those with HIV (3/3). Mean time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 5 weeks. In 8 patients, the infection occurred outside the hospital setting. The infection was restricted to the lung in 9/10; in the remaining case, the central nervous system (CNS) and subcutaneous tissue were affected. Lobar or multilobar consolidation was the most frequent radiographic pattern found (6/10). Sputum culture was positive when performed (8 cases). Diagnosis was made or confirmed by bronchoscopy (bronchoaspirate or protected specimen brush) in 5 patients. Germs isolated were: Nocardia asteroides (8/10), Nocardia farcinica (1/10), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (1/10). Cotrimoxazole was the most used empirical treatment (6/10). Resolution was achieved in 5 cases. Four subjects died: 1 HIV patient with disseminated nocardiosis, and 3 COPD patients, 2 of whom had received long-term corticotherapy. Illness recurred in only 1 case, due to failure to comply with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: (1) In our geographical setting Nocardia presents as a subacute or chronic pulmonary infection, mainly outside the hospital. (2) It tends to affect only the lung. (3) Diagnosis requires a high clinical suspicion, and can be made on the basis of a sputum culture. (4) Nocardia tends to attack patients with underlying COPD, or immunodepressed patients treated with glucocorticoids, or patients with HIV infection. (5) Mortality is high in both COPD and HIV patients. (6) In our area, cotrimoxazole seems to be the most commonly prescribed treatment."

Our laboratory quickly identificatied a bacteria belonging to the Nocardia genus, with simple technique, later confirmed by a specialized laboratory (Pr. Boiron Claude Bernard University Lyon I) with identification of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. The proof of pulmonary nocardiosis could not be established despite the existente of several risk factors. Prognosis is poor for immunocompromised patients, but the secondary cutaneous dissemination phase presented a favourable evolution under antibiotic therapy."

A total of 63 clinical isolates were referred to the NRC and identified as Nocardia asteroides (66.7%), Nocardia farcinica (23.8%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.2%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (4.8%) and Nocardia carnea (1.5%). Nocardia asteroides accounted for 71.4% of pulmonary infections, 80.0% of central nervous system infections and 80.0% of systemic infections. Patients infected with Nocardia farcinica died in 57.1% of cases, compared with 17.6% of patients infected with Nocardia asteroides. Corticosteroid therapy represented a significant factor in mortality. Isolates of Nocardia asteroides revealed variable resistance, whereas isolates of Nocardia farcinica were resistant to most antimicrobial agents. Only amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefoxitin, kanamycin, amikacin, minocycline and vancomycin showed activity against both species. Nocardiosis caused by Nocardia farcinica may be a growing problem because of the relatively high incidence in AIDS patients and the resistance of this species to most antimicrobial agents."

Cutaneous-subcutaneous, pulmonary and systemic signs are observed in feline nocardiosis. However, osteomyelitis is a rare clinical manifestation in cats. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (formerly N. asteroides sensu stricto), Nocardia brasiliensis, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, and Nocardia nova are the most common pathogenic species identified in cats, based on recent molecular classification (16S rRNA gene). The present report is, to our knowledge, the first case of mandibular osteomyelitis in a cat caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of methods, including molecular techniques. CASE PRESENTATION: A one-year-old non-neutered female cat, raised in a rural area, was admitted to the Companion Animal Hospital-PUCPR, Sao Jose dos Pinhais, State of Parana, Brazil, with a history a progressive facial lesion, difficulty apprehending food, loss of appetite, apathy and emaciation. Clinical examination showed fever, submandibular lymphadenitis, and a painless, 8 cm diameter mass, which was irregularly-shaped, of firm consistency, and located in the region of the left mandible. The skin around the lesion was friable, with diffuse inflammation (cellulitis), multiple draining sinuses, and exudation of serosanguinous material containing whitish ""sulfur"" granules.Diagnosis was based initially in clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological, and histopathological findings, and radiographic images. Molecular sequencing of 16S rRNA of isolate allowed diagnosis of Nocardia africana. Despite supportive care and antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing the animal died. CONCLUSION: The present report describes a rare clinical case of feline osteomyelitis caused by Nocardia africana, diagnosed based upon a combination of clinical signs, microbiological culture, cytological and histopathological findings, radiographic images, and molecular methods. The use of modern molecular techniques constitutes a quick and reliable method for Nocardia species identification, and may contribute to identification to new species of Nocardia that are virulent in cats."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. DISCUSSION: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections. Nocardiosis manifests various clinical features depending on the Nocardia species and underlying conditions."

A case of dissemination nocardiosis caused by N. otitidiscaviarum in an immunocompetent host is reported and the associated literature reviewed. Informed consent for publication of this case report was provided by the patient. The present patient was a young immunocompetent man suffering from disseminated nocardiosis induced by infection with N. otitidiscaviarum. Following a poor response to beta-lactam antibiotic, a combination of sulfonamide with minocycline was administered, which successfully ameliorated the symptoms. Previous studies published in English were retrieved from PubMed with 'Nocardia otitidiscaviarum' used as the search keyword. A total of 23 articles were retrieved from the PubMed database, supporting the assertion that N. otitidiscaviarum is a rare Nocardia species. Among these 23 cases, there were 11 cases of lymphocutaneous (48%), 5 of pulmonary (22%), 2 of brain (9%) and 1 of pyothorax (4%) infection, and 4 cases of disseminated infections (17%). Analysis of the immune state of these patients demonstrated that 9 were immunocompetent (39%), 7 of whom had cutaneous infections (30%) with a predominant history of trauma (6/7), and 14 were immunosuppressed, 9 of whom were treated with prednisolone. Microbiology and histopathology were necessary in all cases for definite diagnosis. Among the 13 cases who underwent drug susceptibility testing, 10 cases were sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and 12 cases were sensitive to aminoglycoside. In conclusion, although N. otitidiscaviarum is one of the less commonly isolated species of Nocardia, it is capable of inducing localized or disseminated infection, even in an immunocompetent host. The majority of cases respond well to TMP-SMX and aminoglycoside, but the therapeutic action of cephalosporin is weak. Identification of bacteria and drug sensitivity tests for Nocardia is critical for guiding clinical treatment."

However, its immunological features remain largely unaddressed. We investigated the immunological characteristics of human nocardiosis and examined the component cells of the granulomatous lesions. A 66-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presented with fever and multiple nodules in the lung during chemotherapy. The blood culture formed white colonies, but their characterization was difficult by routine microbiological laboratory methods. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry identified the colonies as Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. Meanwhile, the patient suddenly experienced an epileptic seizure without a brain abscess. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed neutrophilic pleocytosis (108/mm3). The conventional agar culturing failed to isolate colonies, but culturing with brain-heart infusion agar generated colonies. These colonies were completely concordant with those from the blood, as confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Therefore, the patient had developed meningitis through sepsis induced by N. otitidiscaviarum. His CD4-positive T-lymphocyte counts were low, and oligoclonal CD8-positive alphabeta T-lymphocytes were present in the blood prior to the first and after three cycles of chemotherapy. He had bone marrow granulomatous lesions comprising lymphoma and CD8-positive alphabeta T-cells. Treatment with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim relieved all of his symptoms. The combined analysis by microbiological and molecular methods determined the cause of his epileptic seizure. His immunological characteristics, including low CD4-positive or CD8-positive alphabeta T-lymphocytes, may have contributed to the unusual clinical presentations by N. otitidiscaviarum, which rarely involves the central nervous system."

We report two cases of fatal pulmonary infection caused by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in elderly patients. METHODOLOGY: Case 1: A 70-year old woman presented with fever and cough with expectoration for a month. On physical examination, she had tachypnea and inspiratory crepitations in bilateral basal regions. Case 2: A 74-year old man presented with productive cough with foul smelling expectoration, fever and shortness of breath for one week. On examination, he had tachypnea, bilateral wheezing and inspiratory crepitations. In both cases, sputum was sent to microbiology laboratory. On direct microscopy Gram-positive, finely branching filaments were observed which were acid fast with 1% sulphuric acid. Chalky white opaque wrinkled colonies with musty basement type odour were seen on blood agar. Both patients were treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Nocardia infection after notification of microscopy findings however both expired on Day 2 and Day 5 of admission, respectively. Both isolates were susceptible to amikacin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. They were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin, and imipenem. Based on biochemical identification and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, the organism was identified as Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. The identification was confirmed using MALDI-TOF (Vitek MS, Biomerieux, France). CONCLUSION: Our report highlights the importance of early identification of Nocardia to species level to improve treatment outcomes especially in critically ill patients.

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by standard Broth microdilution method. The 27 patients with Nocardia infection included 12 males and 15 females with a mean age of 60.11 years. Among 27 Nocardia isolates, 7 species were identified, with the most common species being N. otitidiscaviarum (40.7%). The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles varied between different Nocardia species. Notably, all Nocardia isolates were linezolid susceptible. Majority of Nocardia isolates were collected from a department of respiratory medicine (55.56%) and sputum specimen (44.44%). Pulmonary region was the most involved body site (70.37%), followed by skin (7.4%) and pleural cavity (7.4%). Most patients with Nocardia infection needed combination antibiotic therapy. Two deaths were reported during the treatment period and 24 patients achieved improvement after antibiotic therapy. The clinical manifestations of Nocardia infection and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles varied with diverse Nocardia species. Thus, the accurate identification of these species is crucial for the diagnosis and the selection of antibiotic treatment."

Despite being uncommon, N. otitidiscaviarum has been associated with skin, lung, and disseminated infections. Case report: A 56-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent travel to the Bahamas presented to the emergency room with complains of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and non-bloody diarrhea for four days. He ultimately required a PICC line for total parenteral nutrition. 2 days after line placement, he developed high fevers and severe right arm pain. Diagnostic imaging revealed venous thrombosis of cephalic vein and abscess formation within the soft tissue of right axilla with cultures ultimately growing Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. He underwent surgical incision and drainage of the abscess followed up with complete excision of the right cephalic vein and antecubital vein as well as sharp excisional debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle fascia and was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 months. Conclusion: Nocardia otitidiscaviarum treatment of cutaneous disease consists of trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole for three to six months. While guidelines for surgical intervention for cutaneous infection are not specified, our patient required surgical incision and drainage of abscess, along with excision of vein due to necrosis in addition to antibiotic treatment for 3 months with successful outcomes."

Nocardiae normally enter the body via the respiratory tract, but they may also be directly inoculated into the skin, causing primary cutaneous disease. Nocardia otitidiscaviarum is one of the less commonly isolated species of Nocardia, but it can produce localized or disseminated infection. We report a case of primary cutaneous N. otitidiscaviarum infection and review the clinical and microbiological features of other reported cases. Cutaneous N. otitidiscaviarum infection usually occurs in the setting of trauma, most often in otherwise healthy hosts. The manifestations of N. otitidiscaviarum skin infection range from cellulitis and abscess formation to the development of mycetomas. Cutaneous infection by N. otitidiscaviarum can mimic disease caused by more common pyogenic organisms, often leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, usually with a sulfa drug-containing regimen, is generally successful."

Nocardia nova was isolated in two patients, Nocardia farcinica in one, and unspecified Nocardia sp. in one. Nocardia isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim sulfa (TMP/SMX). Our data suggest that the dose of TMP/SMX, commonly used for Pneumocystis prophylaxis is not protective for Nocardia.

METHODS: The clinical and radiological data of 2 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis in this hospital were presented, and 32 cases reported in the Chinese literature since 1982 were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the 34 cases of Nocardia infections, there were 26 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis, and 4 of whom died. Multiple organ infection occurred in 11 patients, including 7 with pulmonary and skin infections, 3 with pulmonary, skin and intracranial infections, and 1 with pulmonary and intracranial infections. All patients with pulmonary nocardiosis had cough. Of the 34 cases, 27 had fever, including intermittent fever in 5, and sustained fever in 22 cases. Of the 11 cases of pulmonary nocardiosis complicated with skin or intracranial dissemination, 8 patients were immunocompromised and 3 were immunocompetent (chi(2) = 2.08, P &gt; 0.05). Three cases died in the immunocompromised group and 1 died in the immunocompetent group. Nocardia asteroides was identified in 14 cases, Nocardia brasiliensis in 4 cases, and the other 8 were not classified. In the patients with complicated skin or intracranial infections, 8 were caused by Nocardia asteroids, and 2 were caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. Chest X-ray or CT imaging of the lungs showed pleural effusion in 8, masses in 7, infiltrates in 6, cavities in 6, and nodular lesions in 5 cases. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that Nocardia was sensitive to sulfonamide, amikacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, minocycline, fluoroquinolones, and linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression is the most important predisposing factor for pulmonary nocardiosis. The most common pathogenic bacterium is Nocardia asteroids, which is frequently associated with disseminated lesions. The radiographic abnormalities of the lung show pleural effusion, masses, infiltration or cavity. With the increasing rate of resistance of Nocardia to the sulfonamide, the combination of antibiotic regimen according to susceptibility testing needs to be considered.

From May 2006, he presented with recurrent left- and right-sided pneumothorax. In June 2006, he presented with dyspnoea, fever, and nodular eruption on his ankles. Chest X-ray and CT scan revealed a right pneumothorax, severe bronchiectasis and bilateral alveolar consolidation. N. farcinica was idolated from his sputum without any other pathogens. Treatment with intravenous cotrimoxazole associated with imipenem and amikacin was initiated for three weeks followed by oral cotrimoxazole for a further nine months.

The first case is an immunocompetent patient who was infected by Nocardia while gardening and developed a superficial skin infection--one of the three clinical manifestations of primary cutaneous nocardiosis. The second case is an immunocompromised patient with pulmonary nocardiosis that extended to the skin as part of a disseminated disease. RESULTS: The immunocompetent patient with primary cutaneous nocardiosis had the classical features of a superficial skin infection. He had a nodular-pustular lesion on the right arm, which appeared 7 days after gardening with bare hands. Nocardia was identified in a skin culture taken from a pustule, unfortunately not to the species level. Treatment with minocycline for 3 months resulted in full remission of the lesion.

After the treatment of PCP, he was referred to our hospital for the initiation of anti-HIV therapy. He presented with recurrent high-grade fever of a few days' duration prior to his initial visit, which subsequently led to his admission.

Nocardia spp. are opportunistic pathogens, and N. farcinica is the least common species of clinical importance. METHODS: Review of the recent literature and description of a immunocompetent patient with no known risk factors who contracted fatal N. farcinica sepsis. RESULTS: Positive pre-mortem and post-mortem cultures from the lung and synovium correlated with acute bronchopneumonia and synovitis at autopsy. Colonies of filamentous bacteria, which were not apparent in conventional hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, were observed with gram and methenamine silver stains, but acid-fast stains were negative. A literature review revealed that disseminated N. farcinica often is associated with an underlying malignant tumor or autoimmune disease (88% of patients). Chemotherapy or corticosteroid treatments are additional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole typically is the first-line therapy for N. farcinica; treatment with amikacin and imipenem-cilastatin is used less often (7% of patients). Despite aggressive therapy, we observed that the death rate (39%) associated with N. farcinica in recent publications was eight percentage points higher than reported in a review from 2000."

Molecular techniques have revolutionised the identification of Nocardia species. However such tests are limited to referral laboratories. The radiographic appearances of Nocardia infection vary from a small nodule to bilateral infiltrates with cavitation. Traditionally sulphonamides have been considered the treatment of choice. However, resistance to sulphonamides is increasingly recognised. Carbapenems and linezolid have been found to be uniformly active against all the pathogenic species of Nocardia that affect human beings.

DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A retrospective cohort study. We reviewed the charts of all patients with nocardiosis in the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, a tertiary medical center in Israel, between the years 1996 and 2011. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients who had positive culture of Nocardia were analyzed. The majority of our patients were immunocompromised (74.5%), mostly due to corticosteroid therapy. None had HIV/AIDS. The clinical presentation was either acute or a chronic smoldering illness. The three major clinical syndromes were pleuropulmonary, neurological and skin/soft tissue infection about 20.5% each. Pathology in the lungs was seen in most of the patients by CT scan; discrete nodules and wedge shaped pleural based consolidations were the most frequent findings. Brain lesions consistent with abscesses were detected in 10 patients by brain imaging. Some cases had relapsing disease in spite of antimicrobial treatment. 25% of examined isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The duration of intravenous antimicrobial treatment ranged from one month to over a year in the severe cases. One year mortality rate was 32%.

They can also cause localized cutaneous and soft tissue infections in healthy people after direct percutaneous inoculation. Nocardia arthritis is rare in both forms of the disease. Here we present the first published case of a child with septic arthritis caused by N brasiliensis. Importantly, this otherwise well 4-year-old girl had no known history of trauma but presented with transient cutaneous lesions and a 6-week history of arthritis involving the right fourth digit proximal interphalangeal joint without accompanying fever or raised systemic inflammatory markers. She received a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and underwent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressant therapy. After 2 months she developed frank septic arthritis, which necessitated a surgical joint washout, from which an intraoperative swab grew N brasiliensis. The patient received 6 months of high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and remains well more than 4 years after treatment. This unusual case highlights the importance of considering an indolent infection from slow-growing organisms, including Nocardia, when diagnosing the oligoarthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This is especially relevant when a single joint is involved and response to antiinflammatory therapy is suboptimal because antiinflammatory agents may mask evolving signs of infection. "

The incidence of nocardiosis varies geographically according to several factors, such as the prevalence of HIV infections, transplants, neoplastic and rheumatic diseases, as well as climate, socio-economic conditions and laboratory procedures for Nocardia detection and identification. In Brazil the paucity of clinical reports of Nocardia infections suggests that this genus may be underestimated as a cause of human diseases and/or either neglected or misidentified in laboratory specimens. Accurate identification of Nocardia species has become increasingly important for clinical and epidemiological investigations. In this study, seven clinical Nocardia isolates were identified by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and their antimicrobial susceptibility was also determined. Most Nocardia isolates were associated to pulmonary disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The majority of Brazilian human isolates in cases reported in literature were identified as Nocardia sp. Molecular characterization was used for species identification of Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia asiatica and Nocardia exalbida/gamkensis. Data indicated that molecular analysis provided a different Nocardia speciation than the initial biochemical identification for most Brazilian isolates. All Nocardia isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobial of choice in the treatment nocardiosis. N. nova isolated from different clinical specimens from one patient showed identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and two distinct clones. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country in terms of land mass and population, pulmonary, extrapulmonary and systemic forms of nocardiosis were reported in only 6 of the 26 Brazilian states from 1970 to 2013. A least 33.8% of these 46 cases of nocardiosis proved fatal. Interestingly, coinfection by two clones may occur in patients presenting nocardiosis. Nocardia infection may be more common throughout the Brazilian territory and in other developing tropical countries than is currently recognized and MLSA should be used more extensively as an effective method for Nocardia identification."

Ectopic Cushings is endogenous ACTH dependant form of Cushing's associated with markedly raised ACTH and cortisol levels. This leads to an impaired immune response, setting the stage for occurrence of opportunistic infections. Nocardiosis is a gram positive bacterial infection caused by aerobic actinomycetes in genus Nocardia. We report a series of patients diagnosed with ectopic Cushings, having pneumonia with Nocardia spp. In one of these cases, the manifestations of Cushing's disappeared with treatment for Nocardia. CASE PRESENTATION: Two middle aged men of Asian descent presented to the Endocrine clinic: the first with history of exertional shortness of breath, and weight loss for 1 year, the other with facial swelling, disturbed sleep and lethargy for a month. The third case was a young Asian male who presented with progressive weakness &amp; weight loss for 2 months. All three patients had uncontrolled hypertension, high blood sugars &amp; were hypokalemic (K: 2.52, 2.9, 1.5 mmol/l); 24 hour urine cortisol was elevated at 2000, 27216 and 9088 (32-243 ug/24 hours); ACTH 68.5, 159, 255 [0-48 pg/ml), respectively. Their MRI pituitary was normal, inferior petrosal sinus sampling revealed no central peripheral gradient. CT chest of these subjects demonstrated cavitatory lung lesions; microscopic analysis of respiratory samples was suggestive of infection with Nocardia spp. Histopathology of bronchoscopic-guided biopsy revealed no malignancy. Antihypertensives, insulin, potassium replacement, ketoconazole &amp; trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TS) were initiated. The patients' symptomatology improved &amp; cavitatory lesions resolved with treatment. The primary source for the ectopic cushings remained unknown. The first case required bilateral adrenalectomy. The second case followed a progressively downhill course leading to death. In the third case, we were able to completely taper off ketoconazole, potassium, insulin &amp; antihypertensives, after starting TS. CONCLUSION: Opportunistic infections are known to be associated with Cushing's syndrome, and higher levels of glucocorticoid secretion are found in patients with ectopically produced ACTH. Pulmonary nocardiosis is important differential to consider. This series includes the first case reported in which signs and symptoms of cushings subsided after treatment of Nocardia."

Considering that the nocardiosis had developed under prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia using one tablet per day of a sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination, meropenem and amikacin were administered in addition to the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination for 6 and 4 weeks, respectively. After N. elegans had been identified from the sputum, antibiotics were switched to a sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination and clarithromycin based on the susceptibility results. The patient's clinical and radiological findings were improved and have been well sustained."

COPD is one of the most common comorbidity observed in immuno-competent patients with PN. In this perspective study, we report the clinical patterns, the outcomes and the comorbidities of all cases of PN admitted in our Unit in the years 1999-2012. Among 6545 patients admitted in our Unit during the study time, we identified PN in 4 patients. COPD was coexistent in 3 out of 4 cases. A delayed time for the diagnosis was observed. Clinical-radiological improvement was detected in all cases after one month of specific anti-PN therapy. According to our experience, PN is a rare disease that should be suspected also in immuno-competent patients. COPD is confirmed to be a risk factor for the development of PN, probably due to reduced respiratory defenses and prolonged steroid therapy. "

It usually occurs in incomplete forms, complicating and delaying diagnosis until damage is already irreversible. It is unrelated to time from transplantation and often presents with concomitant infection, which tends to confound diagnosis. The cases discussed here have a common causative agent and all present with concomitant infection. Treatment recommendations have changed in recent years with the introduction of plasmapheresis or, more recently, the availability of the antibody eculizumab. Notwithstanding, the most cost-effective measure is withdrawal or switching of the calcineurin inhibitor. TMA is an underdiagnosed clinical entity that should be considered in the management of transplantation patients. "

Sixteen French CF cases of colonization/infection with Nocardia spp. were reviewed in order to evaluate the epidemiology, the clinical impact and the potential treatment of these bacteria, and results were compared to those of the literature. Five Nocardia species were identified, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica being the major species (50 % of cases). At first isolation, Nocardia was the sole pathogen recovered in six patients. Seven patients presented pulmonary exacerbation. For 12 patients, antimicrobial treatment against Nocardia was started immediately, mainly based on cotrimoxazole (6 of the 12 cases). In this study, we highlight the heterogeneity of the clinical management of Nocardia spp. in CF. Guidelines for the clinical management of Nocardia infections in CF patients are proposed."

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings of patients with pulmonary nocardiosis have been documented in few reports. Our study objective was to assess HRCT findings of patients with pulmonary nocardiosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 20 consecutive patients with pulmonary Nocardia infections who underwent HRCT of the chest at our institutions from January 2011 to August 2014. After the exclusion of two patients with concurrent infections, the study group comprised 18 patients (11 men, 7 women; age range, 39-83 years; mean, 67.9 years) with pulmonary Nocardia infections. Parenchymal abnormalities, enlarged lymph nodes, and pleural effusion were evaluated on HRCT. RESULTS: Underlying conditions included respiratory disease (n = 6, 33.3%), collagen diseases (n = 5, 27.8%), and diabetes mellitus (n = 4, 22.2%). All patients showed abnormal HRCT findings, including the presence of a nodule/mass (n = 17, 94.4%), ground-glass opacity (n = 14, 77.8%), interlobular septal thickening (n = 14, 77.8%), and cavitation (n = 12, 66.7%). Pleural effusion was seen in two patients. There were no cases of lymph node enlargement. CONCLUSIONS: Among the HRCT findings in patients with pneumonia, a nodule/mass with interlobular septal thickening and/or cavitation are suggestive of pulmonary nocardiosis."

Clinical manifestations range from localized skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening pulmonary, central nervous system, and/or disseminated infections. Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for nocardiosis, and further data in regard to characteristics of disease in this population are warranted. METHODS: We performed retrospective chart review of patients post allogeneic HSCT at Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida diagnosed with nocardiosis from 2003 to 2013. RESULTS: In a decade, 15 cases of nocardiosis were identified. The majority of patients were men (11/15). The median age was 55 years (range 25-65). The most common type of transplant was matched-related donor (n = 8), followed by matched-unrelated donor (n = 3), mismatched-unrelated donor (n = 3), and double umbilical cord (n = 1). Ten received myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens. Twelve of 15 patients were on prednisone, 10 of which were on a total daily dose &gt;=20 mg. The median time from transplant to first positive culture was 10 months (range 1.5-93). Pulmonary nocardiosis was the most prevalent manifestation at 87%. Disseminated disease (2 or more sites of infection) was seen in 47%, whereas blood cultures were positive in 27% of the total cohort. The most common species was Nocardia nova (n = 4). At the time of diagnosis, 20% of the patients were receiving prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Susceptibility data were available for 8 patients: all 8 samples were susceptible to TMP-SMX. Nocardiosis was treated with 2 or more active drugs in 93% of the patients. Overall mortality was 53%, with nocardiosis attributed as the cause in 62.5% (5/8). The absolute lymphocyte count at time of diagnoses was significantly lower in patients who ultimately experienced treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Infection with Nocardia species in allogeneic HSCT recipients appears to be a late complication of transplantation and most commonly involves the lung. Two-thirds of the cohort received a MAC regimen and the majority of the patients were receiving steroids at the time of diagnosis. Most patients were not receiving TMP-SMX for PJP prophylaxis at the time of nocardiosis diagnosis, and TMP-SMX may therefore have a protective effect."

The lungs are the primary site of infection mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. In rare circumstances even immunocompetent hosts may also develop infection. Diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is usually delayed due to nonspecific clinical and radiological presentations which mimic fungal, tuberculous, or neoplastic processes. The present report describes a rare bronchoscopic presentation of an endobronchial nocardial mass in a 55-year-old immunocompetent woman without underlying lung disease. The patient exhibited signs and symptoms of unresolving community-acquired pneumonia with a computed tomography (CT) scan that showed a space-occupying lesion and enlarged paratracheal lymph node. This patient represents the unusual presentation of pulmonary Nocardia beijingensis as an endobronchial mass. Pathology obtained during bronchoscopy demonstrated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation of nocardiosis. Symptoms and clinical findings improved with antibiotic treatment. This patient emphasizes the challenge in making the diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis, especially in a low risk host.

The present study was carried out to determine the spectrum of Nocardia infections in a renal transplant centre in Australia. METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of all renal transplants performed from 2008 to 2014 was conducted to identify cases of culture proven Nocardia infection. The clinical course for each patient with nocardiosis was examined. RESULTS: Four of the 543 renal transplants patients developed Nocardia infection within 2 to 13 months post-transplant. All patients were judged at high immunological risk of rejection pre-transplant and had received multiple sessions of plasmaphoeresis and intravenous immunoglobulin before the onset of the infection. Two patients presented with pulmonary nocardiosis and two with cerebral abscesses. One case of pulmonary nocardiosis was complicated by pulmonary aspergillosis and the other by cytomegalovirus pneumonia. All four patients improved with combination antibiotic therapy guided by drug susceptibility testing. At the time of Nocardia infection all four patients were receiving primary prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 160/800 mg, twice weekly. CONCLUSION: Plasmaphoeresis may be risk factor for Nocardia infection and need further study. Nocardia infection may coexist with other opportunistic infections. Identification of the Nocardia species and drug susceptibility testing is essential in guiding the effective management of patients with Nocardia. Intermittent TMP-SMX (one double strength tablet, twice a week) appears insufficient to prevent Nocardia infection in renal transplant recipients."

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the isolates showed that they share 100 % sequence similarity with each other and belong to the genus Nocardia. Close phylogenetic neighbours are Nocardia brevicatena ATCC 15333(T) (98.6 %) and Nocardia paucivorans ATCC BAA-278T (98.4 %). The in silico DNA-DNA relatedness between the isolates ranges from 96.8 to 100 % suggesting that they belong to the same genomic species. The DNA-DNA relatedness between X1654 and N. brevicatena ATCC 15333(T) is 13.3 +- 2.3 % and N. paucivorans ATCC BAA-278T is 18.95 +- 1.1 % suggesting that they do not belong to the same genomic species. Believed to represent a novel species, these isolates were further characterised to establish their taxonomic standing within the genus. Chemotaxonomic data for isolate X1654 are consistent with those described for the genus Nocardia: this isolate produced saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, tuberculostearic acid (15.9 %), the major menaquinone was MK-8 (H4cyclic), mycolic acid chain lengths ranged from 38 to 58 carbons, produced meso-diaminopimelic acid with arabinose, glucose, and galactose as the whole cell sugars. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. The DNA G+C content is 66.7 mol  %. Based on the combination of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genotypic data for X1654, X1655, and W9944, we conclude that these isolates represent a novel species within the genus Nocardia for which we propose the name Nocardia donostiensis sp. nov. with X1654(T) (=DSM 46814(T) = CECT 8839(T)) as the type strain.

Seven patients had a reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) in the pleura, cervical spine, lumbar spine, knee, ankle, skin and peritoneum, respectively, and were all resolved satisfactorily with conventional anti-TB therapy. Three patients transplanted before routine prophylaxis with the use of acyclovir developed an extensive herpes zoster infection in the 1st 6 months after transplantation, which was resolved with the use of oral acyclovir, and 1 had a disseminated herpes simplex infection resolved with the use of IV acyclovir. Three patients transplanted before routine prophylaxis with trimethoprim sulfa developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the 1st 6 months after transplantation, which was fatal in one of them. In 2 patients, we found a Nocardia infection, confined to the lung, which was cured in one of the cases and systemic and fatal in the other. Two patients transplanted before routine prophylaxis with the use of nystatin developed esophageal candidiasis in the 1st 6 months after transplantation. One patient developed infective endocarditis in a stenotic bicuspid aortic valve and died 10 years later after another incident of infective endocarditis at the prosthetic aortic valve.

The isolated species were identified as Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia transvalensis, Nocardia pneumoniae, Nocardia veterana and Nocardia wallacei. N. farcinica was isolated in three patients and all of them presented lung affectation with a chronic colonization and pneumonia. N. farcinica showed resistance against gentamicin, tobramycin, cefotaxime, but was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amikacin. N. transvalensis, which was isolated from two patients, showed an association with chronic colonization. N. transvalensis was resistant to tobramycin and amikacin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefotaxime. N. veterana, N. pneumoniae and N. wallacei were isolated from three different patients and appeared in transitory lung colonization. N. veterana and N. pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, tobramycin, and cefotaxime. N. wallacei was resistant to amikacin, tobramycin, imipenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. All the isolates were identified up to species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The presence of Nocardia in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis is not always an indication of an active infection; therefore, the need for a treatment should be evaluated on an individual basis.

Of a total of 54 patients with culture-proven nocardiosis diagnosed over 13 years, 18 (33%) were immunocompetent. Half of immunocompetent patients had chronic lung disease and were not receiving systemic corticosteroid. There were no significant differences in clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes according to immune status, except that pulmonary cavitation (47% vs. 8%) and coexisting infections (17% vs. 0%) were more frequent in immunocompromised hosts. Nocardia farcinica, the most commonly identified isolates at the species level (51%), was highly susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100%) and highly resistant to ceftriaxone (94%).

Such infections represent an important diagnostic challenge for clinicians and microbiologists, and diagnosis is frequently delayed or even conducted post mortem. A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of ventriculitis and relapsing brain abscess. Five months prior, this patient had undergone external ventricular drain and surgery for a cerebellar abscess. Histopathology demonstrated pyogenic inflammatory reaction, microbiologic investigations proved negative and empiric antimicrobial therapy was administered for a total of eight weeks. Six weeks later, the patient developed relapsing neurologic manifestations. On reviewing the patient's clinical history it emerged that the patient had suffered pneumonia two months prior to neurosurgery, treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate 3g a day and levofloxacin 500mg a day for three weeks. On the CNS relapsing manifestations, nocardiosis was suspected and DNA sequencing from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cerebellar tissue collected during neurosurgery allowed diagnosis of Nocardia paucivorans infection. The patient received medical therapy for 11 months. At follow-up, eight months after treatment was discontinued, the patient was aymptomatic. Nocardia spp. infections need to be suspected not only in immunocompromised, but also in immunocompetent patients. Proper samples need to be collected for proper microbiologic investigations.

AIM: In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical spectrum and outcome of patients with pulmonary nocardiosis. METHODS: A retrospective, 5-year (2009-2014) review of demographic profile, risk factors, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, treatment, and outcome of patients with pulmonary nocardiosis admitted to a tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: The median age of the study subjects was 54 years (range, 16-76) and majority of them (75%) were males. The risk factors for pulmonary nocardiosis identified in our study were long-term steroid use (55.6%), chronic lung disease (52.8%), diabetes (27.8%), and solid-organ transplantation (22.2%). All the patients were symptomatic, and the most common symptoms were cough (91.7%), fever (78%), and expectoration (72%). Almost two-third of the patients were initially misdiagnosed and the alternative diagnosis included pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 7), community-acquired pneumonia (n = 5), lung abscess (n = 4), invasive fungal infection (n = 3), lung cancer (n = 2), and Wegener's granulomatosis (n = 2). The most common radiographic features were consolidation (77.8%) and nodules (56%). The mortality rate for indoor patients was 33% despite treatment. Higher mortality rate was observed among those who had brain abscess (100.0%), HIV positivity (100%), need for mechanical ventilation (87.5%), solid-organ transplantation (50%), and elderly (age &gt; 60 years) patients (43%). CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is often missed and delayed resulting in delay in appropriate treatment and thus high mortality. A lower threshold for diagnosing pulmonary nocardiosis needs to be exercised, in chest symptomatic patients with underlying chronic lung diseases or systemic immunosuppression, for the early diagnosis, and treatment of this uncommon but potentially lethal disease. Despite treatment mortality remains high, especially in those with brain abscess, HIV positivity, need for mechanical ventilation, solid-organ transplantation, and elderly."

Although the patient survived as a result of surgery and prolonged antibiotic treatment, he eventually lost vision after the infection became resistant to antibiotic treatment. Molecular analysis of samples from the abscess and vitreous fluid confirmed the extremely rare pathogen N. elegans, which accounts for only 0.3-0.6% of infections caused by Nocardia species. This organism is almost always associated with pulmonary infection, and disseminated infections are rare. As with previously reported norcardial infections, the current case was treated successfully with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides. However, the clinical characteristics of this organism remain unclear. Further studies are therefore required to develop more effective treatment protocols for disseminated nocardiosis caused by this problematic pathogen."

","SPECIES:Nocardia pneumoniae ID:27932160TITLE:Successful Short-Term Intravenous Treatment of Disseminated Nocardia farcinica Infection with Severe Hyponatremia After Kidney Transplantation: A Case Report.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Nocardia is a genus of gram-positive Actinomycetes that are ubiquitous in decaying organic material, soil, and water. Some Nocardia species can infect humans, mainly by airborne transmission. Several reports describe disseminated infections, which are rare and mostly affect strongly immunocompromised patients because intact T-cell-mediated immunity is the major protective mechanism. CASE REPORT: We report a case of disseminated pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous infection with Nocardia farcinica in a 66-year-old kidney transplant recipient treated with low-dose triple immunosuppression. The patient was initially admitted because of severe hyponatremia and pneumonia with radiologic signs of pleural effusion. The infectious agent was isolated when cutaneous lesions developed. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment led to severe hyponatremia; therefore, long-term treatment with parenteral amikacin and minocycline was initiated. After 7 months of consistent intravenous treatment, the lesions completely resolved and treatment was stopped, against some expert suggestions. The patient had remained free of relapse at the time of writing. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated Nocardia infection in immunocompromised patients is a rare but life-threatening disease. Owing to its infrequency, the variety of clinical patterns, antimicrobial resistance, and often fatal complications of standardized therapy, the diagnosis and treatment of this infection remain challenging and protracted."

This study was performed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary nocardiosis in Japan. Methods The patients definitively diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis at our hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Results Nineteen men and 11 women (30 in total) were diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. Almost all patients were complicated by a non-pulmonary underlying disease, such as malignant tumor or collagen vascular disease, or pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumonia, and 13 patients (43.3%) were treated with steroids or immunosuppressors. Gram staining was performed in 29 patients, and a characteristic Gram-positive rod was detected in 28 patients (96.6%). Thirty-one strains of Nocardia were isolated and identified. Seven strains of Nocardia farcinica were isolated as the most frequent species, followed by Nocardia nova isolated from 6 patients. Seventeen patients died, giving a crude morality rate of 56.7% and a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%. The 1-year survival rates in the groups with and without immunosuppressant agents were 41.7% and 59.7%, respectively, showing that the outcome of those receiving immunosuppressants tended to be poorer than those not receiving them. Conclusion Pulmonary nocardiosis developed as an opportunistic infection in most cases. The outcome was relatively poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%, and it was particularly poor in patients treated with immunosuppressant agents. Pulmonary nocardiosis should always be considered in patients presenting with an opportunistic respiratory infection, and an early diagnosis requires sample collection and Gram staining."

STATE OF THE ART: These infections share many similarities such as several differential diagnoses, difficulties to identify the pathogen, the importance of involving the microbiologist in the diagnostic investigation and the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment. However, major differences distinguish them: Nocardia and Rhodococcus infect mainly immunocompromised patients while actinomycosis also concerns immunocompetent patients; the severity of nocardioses is related to their hematogenous spread while locoregional extension by contiguity makes the gravity of actinomycosis. PROSPECTIVE: For these diseases, molecular diagnostic tools are essential, either to obtain a species identification and guide treatment in the case of nocardiosis or to confirm the diagnosis from a biological sample. Treatment of these infections is complex due to: (1) the limited data in the literature; (2) the need for prolonged treatment of several months; (3) the management of toxicities and drug interactions for the treatment of Nocardia and Rhodococcus. CONCLUSION: Close cooperation between pneumonologists, infectious disease specialists and microbiologists is essential for the management of these patients."

A wide spectrum of pathogens can be implicated, from viruses to pyogenic and atypical bacteria. A special place should be reserved for slow growing bacteria (Mycobacteria spp., Nocardia spp.) and parasites (i.e., hydatic cysts caused by Echinococcus granulosus). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to observe, analyze and establish the drug susceptibility patterns for Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp. (the ESKAPE pathogens) in the ""Marius Nasta"" Institute for Pulmonary Medicine (MNIPM), Bucharest, Romania. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective healthcare record based study was undertaken to establish the drug susceptibility patterns. We assessed all antibiograms of the ESKAPE pathogens isolated from respiratory samples from adult inpatients hospitalized between 2010-2015 at the MNIPM. RESULTS: We analyzed 2859 isolates (61% of the 4683 ESKAPE isolates). P. aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen, while Enterococcus spp. and Enterobacter spp. were practically non-present. The antibiotic profile of P. aeruginosa isolates presented more resistance in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Surgery wards, probably resulting from antibiotic pressure. The other non-fermenter, A. baumannii, while less frequent (and the only pathogen more frequent in the surgery department) had an even more resistant profile, to almost all antibiotics, with the exception of Colistin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for about 60% of all isolates, more in the ICU/Surgery ward. K. pneumoniae presents a less resistance and shows more stability when analyzing the antibiogram pattern in the Medical wards. DISCUSSION: For methodological or procedural reasons, Enterococcus spp. and Enterobacter spp. were underrepresented in the study. Interventional programs comprising antibiotic stewardship and active surveillance need to be implemented to alleviate the antibiotic profile. Further research needs to focus on more detailed characterization of the molecular mechanisms leading to the high resistance detailed herein. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the body of literature reporting the antibiotic resistance landscape in Romania, for these highly resistant pathogens."

With the increasing use of new immunosuppressant drugs, the incidence of opportunistic or atypical infections is also increasing, including with Nocardia spp. A high level of awareness of atypical infections is warranted in immunosuppressed patients. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old female African American, with a past medical history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and arthritis, was treated with infliximab and prednisone. She presented to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, and a two-week history of a productive cough. Examination showed hypoxia, tachypnea, decreased and coarse bilateral breath sounds, and fluctuant, tender, erythematous masses on her trunk and groin. Laboratory investigations showed a leukocytosis with a left shift. She was initially treated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, blood cultures grew Nocardia farcinica and treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was begun, which was complicated by severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Following recovery from infection and resolution of the hyponatremia, the patient was discharged to a senior care facility, but with continued treatment with TMP-SMX. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first case of disseminated nocardiosis associated with infliximab treatment in a patient with ulcerative colitis. As with other forms of immunosuppressive therapy, patients who are treated with infliximab should be followed closely due to the increased risk of atypical infections. When initiating antibiotic therapy, careful monitoring of possible side effects should be done."

We report 10 recent cases of late-onset nocardiosis (median time of onset of 508 days after transplantation) primarily in patients on high doses of corticosteroids for graft-versus-host disease. All 10 patients had pulmonary infection caused by Nocardia species susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). At time of diagnosis 8 of 10 patients were not receiving TMP-SMX for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP; 7 on atovaquone, 1 on i.v. pentamidine). After the initiation of atovaquone prophylaxis for PJP in place of TMP-SMX for many UCLA allogeneic HSCT patients in 2012, 9 cases of nocardiosis occurred in 411 patients (2.2%) over the next 6 years (2012 to 2017) compared with only 1 case in 575 patients (0.17%) during the previous 12 years (2000 to 2011). Although there were no deaths directly related to nocardial infection treated primarily with TMP-SMX, overall mortality in this group of patients was 40%. Based on this experience, the use of atovaquone for PJP prophylaxis in place of TMP-SMX may be associated with an increased risk for previously rare nocardial infections after allogeneic HSCT."

","SPECIES:Nocardia pneumoniae ID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

Here, we report a case of disseminated nocardiosis with subretinal abscess in a patient with nephrotic syndrome, and whom is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male presented with decreased vision in his left eye, without redness or floaters, which had persisted for three days. The patient had previously been diagnosed with membranous nephropathy, and as such, had received systemic corticosteroid therapy for four months. Further, the patient had developed pneumonia three weeks prior to this presentation. The ocular lesion appeared as a creamy-white subretinal abscess, with overlying retinal hemorrhages. Subsequent administration of three intravitreal injections of vancomycin and ceftazidime ultimately led to eradication of the intraocular infection, however, two months later, the patient developed a brain abcess. Pathogens isolated from the blood were subsequently identified as Nocardia. The patient was successfully treated via systemic administration of imipenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of Nocardia infections within all immunocompromised patients, as well as the tendency of this infection to disseminate--particularly in the brain.

Nocardia infections have increased in the last two decades, likely due to improved detection and identification methods and an expanding immunocompromised population. The risk of developing nocardiosis after transplantation varies with the type of organ transplanted and the immunosuppression regimen used. Nocardia infection most commonly involves the lung. Disseminated infection can occur, with spread to the bloodstream, skin, or central nervous system. Early recognition of the infection and initial appropriate treatment is important to achieve good outcomes. Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are strongly recommended, as inter- and intraspecies susceptibility patterns can vary. Sulfonamide is the first-line treatment of Nocardia infections, and combination therapy with at least two antimicrobial agents should be used initially for disseminated or severe nocardiosis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis may be helpful in preventing Nocardia infection after SOT."

METHODS: Retrospective observational analysis of clinical and microbiological data collected from 55 cases ofNocardia pneumonia. RESULTS: From 1 to 20 cases per hospital and from 6 to 9 cases per year were observed. COPD, bronchiectasis and asthma were the main respiratory underlying predisposing conditions. Thirty-four patients were receiving systemic and/or inhaled corticosteroids prior to infection, 8 had neoplasias and 6 hematologic malignancies. Clinical and radiological findings were common to pneumonia of other infectious aetiologies except for the frequent presence of nodules and cavitation. Overall 1 year mortality (38.2%) was high, in 15 patients (27.3%) directly related to the pulmonary disease. The most frequently-identified species were N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 21), N. abscessus (n = 8), and N. farcinica (n = 5). All Nocardia isolates were linezolid-susceptible and all but two amikacin- and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-susceptible.

These infections are rare among normal population and are showing an increasing trend worldwide attributable to the increase in the immunosuppressed population. Most of these patients present with nonspecific clinical features such as fever, productive cough, and exertional dyspnoea as seen in our series of patients which makes it difficult to be diagnosed. Pulmonary nocardiosis is rarely clinically suspected and often diagnosed very late in the course of disease resulting in high mortality. A similar observation was made in one of our cases where the patient was being treated on the lines of pneumonia, and in the end she was diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. In view of the limited literature available, we report here a case series of pulmonary nocardiosis in immunosuppressed patients diagnosed incidentally by fungal KOH mount. The most common conditions causing immunosuppression were type II DM, COPD, and pulmonary tuberculosis."

Western Rajasthan has cases of Cystic fibrosis due to migrant population. The dry and dusty environment has led to prevalence of silicosis and COPD. As per IDSA (2018) guidelines, patients attending Out-Patient Department do not need microbiological investigations for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) except for influenza and tuberculosis. Aims: This study was conducted to identify the bacterial aetiology of LRTI among patients who attended AIIMS, Jodhpur, and to ascertain the current scenario of bacterial susceptibility in respiratory tract infections in order to optimize empiric therapy in Hospitals ad community. Methods and Material: In total, 1,775 lower respiratory tract samples were received in Bacteriology Section of Microbiology Department (January 2017 to December 2018). Bartlett's criteria were stringently used to assess quality of specimen. Semiquantitative cultures were done for tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Following culture, the isolated organisms were identified and antimicrobial sensitivity was performed according to CLSI. Results: Total 769 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 1,775 samples collected from cases of VAP, HAP, CAP, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas species was the commonest isolate (31%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (21.3%), Acinetobacter species (17.5%), Escherichia coli (15.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5%). Others include Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Nocardia. Gram-negative organisms showed increased resistance to routinely used antibiotics. Gram-positive organisms showed 100% susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, and clindamycin.

These aerobic, gram-positive organisms can lead to life-threatening infection, typically in immunocompromised hosts such as solid organ transplant recipients or those receiving immunosuppressive medications for other reasons. This current review discusses the microbiology of nocardiosis, risk factors for infection, clinical manifestations, methods for diagnosis, and treatment. Nocardiosis primarily affects the lung but may also cause skin and soft tissue infection, cerebral abscess, bloodstream infection, or infection involving other organs. Although rare as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia, Nocardia can have severe morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with comorbidities or compromised immunity. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of therapy are critical to optimizing patient outcomes. Species identification is important in determining treatment, as is in vitro susceptibility testing. Sulfonamide therapy is usually indicated, although a variety of other antimicrobials may be useful, depending on the species and susceptibility testing. Prolonged therapy is usually indicated, for 6 to 12 months, and in some cases surgical debridement may be required to resolve infection."

Evidence is limited regarding the risk factors for nocardiosis. The current study assessed clinical correlates of nocardiosis. A retrospective study was conducted based on medical records of consecutive adult patients (N = 60) with nocardiosis hospitalized during 2007-2018 at a tertiary hospital in central Israel. A matched comparison group of 120 patients was randomly selected among hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were fitted. Immunosuppressive pharmacotherapy was positively associated with nocardiosis (matched odds ratio [OR] 4.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25-8.62, p < 0.001), particularly corticosteroid therapy (matched OR 4.69, 95% CI 2.45-8.99, p < 0.001). Systemic corticosteroid therapy was strongly associated with pulmonary nocardiosis (matched OR 5.90, 95% CI 2.75-12.66, p < 0.001). The positive association between solid organ transplantation and nocardiosis was attenuated following adjustment for systemic corticosteroids in a multivariable model. The association between corticosteroid therapy and nocardiosis appeared stronger in patients with chronic pulmonary disease (OR 5.74, 95% CI 2.75-12.66, p < 0.001) than in the pooled analysis of all nocardiosis cases. In conclusion, corticosteroid therapy was strongly correlated with nocardiosis, particularly among individuals with chronic pulmonary disease and in pulmonary nocardiosis."

We aimed at describing nocardiosis in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). METHODS: This international retrospective cohort included patients with PID and nocardiosis diagnosed and/or published from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016. To identify nocardiosis cases, we analyzed PID databases from the French National Reference Center for PID (Paris, France) and the National Institute of Health (NIH, United States of America) and we performed a literature review on PubMed. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases of nocardiosis associated with PID were included: median age at diagnosis of nocardiosis was 19 (0-56) years and most cases were observed among chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients (87.8%). Median time from symptoms to diagnosis of Nocardia infection was 20 (2-257) days. Most frequent clinical nocardiosis presentation was pneumonia (86.7%). Twelve-month mortality rate was 4.2%, and 11.9% of patients experienced a possible recurrence of infection. Nocardiosis more frequently led to the diagnosis of PID among non-CGD patients than in CGD patients. Non-CGD patients experienced more cerebral nocardiosis and more disseminated infections, but mortality and recurrence rates were similar. Highest incidences of nocardiosis among PID cohorts were observed among CGD patients (0.0057 and 0.0044 cases/patient-year in the USA and in France, respectively), followed by IL-12p40 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Among 49 cases of nocardiosis associated with PID, most patients had CGD and lung involvement. Both mortality and recurrence rates were low."

METHODS: In this 1.5-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of mNGS of BALF for identifying pathogens of SCAP in hospitalized adults, comparing it with other laboratory methods. RESULTS: Of 329 SCAP adults, a microbial etiology was established in 304 cases (92.4%). The overall microbial yield was 90.3% for mNGS versus 39.5% for other methods (P < 0.05). The most frequently detected pathogens in immunocompetent patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.8%), rhinovirus (9.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.7%), and Chlamydia psittaci (8.0%), while in immunocompromised patients they were Pneumocystis jirovecii (44.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%). Notably, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified from two patients solely by mNGS in January 2020; uncommon pathogens including Orientia tsutsugamushi and Nocardia otitidiscaviarum were identified from one patient, respectively. Furthermore, mixed infections were detected in 56.8% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high microbial detection rate was achieved in SCAP adults using mNGS testing of BALF. The most frequently detected pathogens of SCAP differed between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. mNGS testing may be an powerful tool for early identification of potential pathogens for SCAP to initiate a precise antimicrobial therapy."

A review of 102 clinical isolates.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: To review the species distribution, pathologic significance and disease associations of clinical isolates of Nocardia and related bacteria in Queensland, and to examine the characteristics, treatment and outcome of patients infected with these organisms. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of Queensland State Health Laboratory records provided microbiological data for Nocardia isolates referred from other laboratories during the period January 1983 to December 1988. Clinical information was extracted from hospital case notes, or obtained from detailed questionnaires completed by attending physicians. Nocardia isolates were classified as ""significant"" if specific treatment for nocardiosis was given, or on the basis of autopsy findings. PATIENTS: One hundred and two patients had a Nocardia species or a related organism isolated from clinical specimens during the study period. RESULTS: The 102 isolates included Nocardia asteroides (45), N, brasiliensis (35), N. caviae (5) and N. transvalensis (5). Clinical results were available for 93 patients, of whom 74 (80%) had a significant isolate recovered. Primary pulmonary or disseminated disease occurred in 35 patients, and was caused mainly by N. asteroides. Significant infections of skin and soft tissues, primarily due to N. brasiliensis, were found in 39 patients. Preexisting lung disease and treatment with steroids and immunosuppression were risk factors for pulmonary and disseminated nocardiosis. A history of inoculation in an outdoor setting was frequent in patients with cutaneous disease. Antibiotic regimens that included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or another sulfonamide agent were used to treat the majority of patients with significant infection. Deaths were confined to those with pulmonary and disseminated disease, with a case fatality rate of 40% in that group. CONCLUSION: Infection with Nocardia species appears to be more common than is generally appreciated. The local species distribution and disease spectrum are similar to those described elsewhere. A high index of suspicion for nocardiosis should be maintained in susceptible hosts with pulmonary infiltrates, particularly when there is evidence for metastatic infection, and in patients with superficial infections and a history of outdoor injury."

Subsequent high-resolution computed tomography (CT) confirmed centrilobular micronodular densities associated with bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectatic changes. CT imaging also revealed volume loss with bronchiectatic changes in both the right middle lobe and the left lingular segment. Cytology specimens were then obtained through bronchial brushing and washes. Smears from right B2 and B4 revealed filamentous gram-positive, branched bacteria embedded among many neutrophils. Nocardia transvalensis was cultured from the bronchial wash, and no mycobacteria were identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Nocardia transvalensis pulmonary infection in an immunocompetent patient, and also the first detailed description of a Nocardia transvalensis pulmonary infection in Japan. Moreover, the radiographic and CT findings in this patient were quite similar to those seen in patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infections, a pattern not previously reported in patients with Nocardia pulmonary infections."

The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology, clinical significance and antimicrobial susceptibility of Nocardia species isolated from eight children with cystic fibrosis. The isolated species were identified as Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia transvalensis, Nocardia pneumoniae, Nocardia veterana and Nocardia wallacei. N. farcinica was isolated in three patients and all of them presented lung affectation with a chronic colonization and pneumonia. N. farcinica showed resistance against gentamicin, tobramycin, cefotaxime, but was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amikacin. N. transvalensis, which was isolated from two patients, showed an association with chronic colonization. N. transvalensis was resistant to tobramycin and amikacin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefotaxime. N. veterana, N. pneumoniae and N. wallacei were isolated from three different patients and appeared in transitory lung colonization. N. veterana and N. pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, tobramycin, and cefotaxime. N. wallacei was resistant to amikacin, tobramycin, imipenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. All the isolates were identified up to species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The presence of Nocardia in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis is not always an indication of an active infection; therefore, the need for a treatment should be evaluated on an individual basis. The detection of multidrug-resistant species needs molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections. "

N. transvalensis is an unusual Nocardia species. However, it must be differentiated due to its natural resistance to aminoglycosides while other Nocardia species are susceptible. The present report describes a Nocardia species involved in an uncommon clinical case of a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and pulmonary nocardiosis.

Methods: Over a 10 year period (2005-14), 1119 Nocardia strains were molecularly identified and subjected to the Etest. The distribution and resistance trends over the sub-periods 2005-09 and 2010-14 were also examined. Results: Of the strains examined, 82.9% belonged to the following species: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (25.3%), Nocardia nova (15.0%), Nocardia abscessus (12.7%), Nocardia farcinica (11.4%), Nocardia carnea (4.3%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.5%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (3.1%), Nocardia flavorosea (2.6%), Nocardia rhamnosiphila (2.6%) and Nocardia transvalensis (2.4%). Their prevalence values were similar during 2005-09 and 2010-14, except for those of N. abscessus , N. farcinica and N. transvalensis , which fell significantly in the second sub-period ( P &lt;=  0.05). The major location of isolation was the respiratory tract (~86%). Half (13/27) of all strains from the CNS were N. farcinica . Significant differences in MIC results were recorded for some species between the two sub-periods. According to the CLSI's breakpoints, low resistance rates (&lt;=15%) were recorded for seven species with respect to cefotaxime, imipenem and tobramycin; five species showed similar rates with respect to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Linezolid and amikacin were the most frequently active agents. Conclusion: The accurate identification of the infecting species and the determination of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, given the large number of strains with atypical patterns, are crucial if patients with nocardiosis are to be successfully treated."

Nocardiosis usually presents with lung infection but may disseminate to other organs, most frequently the brain. The major risk factor is immunosuppression, but lung diseases also increase the risk of infection. Treatment with antibiotics is usually prolonged. In this study, we made a retrospective analysis of pulmonary nocardiosis cases and a review of the available literature. Methods: We made a retrospective analysis of all pulmonary nocardiosis cases from 13 years (January 2005 to December 2017) in our institution, selecting patients from pulmonology and infectious diseases consultation. Results: We found four patients diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis, three males (patients 1, 2 and 3) and one female (patient 4). Median age was 71 +- 15 years old. Different specimens were identified (N. cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia spp., N. nova, and N. wallacei/transvalensis). Bronchofibroscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage culture was the most frequent diagnostic procedure (patients 1 and 4). Only patient 2 presented an unfavorable response to treatment and died from septic shock. Conclusions: Pulmonary nocardiosis has a good prognosis if diagnosed early and treated adequately.

Early diagnosis is considered desirable because it may offer the chance of more successful implementation of treatment and, thereby, improved outcome. Serological tests have previously failed to be accurate for early detection or diagnosis. Measurement of serum amyloid A (SAA) prior to and at the time of clinical signs was therefore chosen in order to assess its potential clinical use. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SAA concentrations differentiate foals affected with R. equi pneumonia from unaffected foals, either prior to the onset of disease or at the time of onset of clinical signs. HYPOTHESIS: SAA concentrations are significantly higher among foals that develop R. equi pneumonia than in foals from the same environment that remain clinically unaffected. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 212 foals 7-14 days and 196 foals 21-28 days post partum, and from affected foals and age-matched controls at the time of onset of signs of pneumonia. SAA concentration was determined for each sample. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between SAA concentrations of foals with R. equi and clinically unaffected foals during the 2 periods of examination or at the time of onset of clinical signs of R. equi pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of SAA are variable among foals with R. equi pneumonia and cannot be used reliably either as an ancillary diagnostic tool or to screen for early detection of disease during the first month post partum. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Bimonthly monitoring concentration of SAA is not useful as a screening test for early detection of R. equi pneumonia and does not facilitate diagnosis of this disease when used according to the protocol of this study."

Pleural effusion was diagnosed on the basis of ultrasonographic and radiographic examinations. Cytologic examination of pleural fluid collected via thoracocentesis revealed septic inflammation; bacteriologic culture of a sample of that fluid yielded Rhodococcus equi. A large intra-abdominal mass adjacent to the body wall was identified ultrasonographically. A specimen of the mass was collected via aspiration; the specimen was identified cytologically as purulent exudate that contained large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria, which confirmed abdominal abscess formation. Bacteriologic culture of a sample of the exudate also yielded R. equi. The foal was treated with azithromycin (10 mg/kg [4.5 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h for 5 days then q 48 h) and rifampin (5 mg/kg [2.3 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h) for 8 weeks and metronidazole (15 mg/kg [6.8 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h) for 3 weeks. Clinically, the foal responded to antimicrobial treatment within 2 weeks. At 8 weeks after the initial evaluation, ultrasonographic examination of the foal revealed resolution of the pleural effusion and abdominal abscess. In foals, R. equi infection typically results in pyogranulomatous pneumonia, and pleural effusion is an uncommon clinical sign. The combination of azithromycin and rifampin appears to be an effective treatment for R. equi infection in foals."

SAMPLE POPULATION: Soil from 24 R equi-affected farms and 21 unaffected farms. PROCEDURE: Equine veterinary practitioners throughout Texas submitted surface soil samples from areas most frequented by foals, on R equi-affected and unaffected horse-breeding farms in their practice. Soil samples were assayed for the following factors: pH, salinity, nitrate, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, sulfur, zinc, iron, manganese, and copper. Median values for all factors were recorded, and differences between affected and unaffected farms were compared. RESULTS: Significant differences in soil factors were not detected between affected and unaffected farms; hence, there was no association between those factors and R equi disease status of the farms. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The surface soil factors monitored in this study were not significant risk factors for pneumonia caused by R equi. As such, it is not possible to determine whether foals on a given farm are at increased risk of developing disease caused by R equi on the basis of these factors. Data do not support altering surface soil for factors examined, such as alkalinization by applying lime, as viable control strategies for R equi."

There are limited data on the outcome of treatment of R. equi pneumonia in the HAART era. We report on a 52-year-old HIV-infected man who presented in poor general condition with an extensive lung cavitation lesion caused by R. equi. The patient recalled exposure to horses on several occasions. R. equi was cultured from the sputum and the isolate was sensitive to imipenem vancomycin, co-trimoxazole, erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin. The CD4+ lymphocyte count was 5 cells/mm3 (0.9%) and his plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 101000 copies/mL. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of antibiotics that included azithromycin both as part of an initial and suppressive regimen together with antiretroviral treatment. Surgery was not needed and the patient had no relapse for more than five years after the diagnosis and for more than 3 years of suppressive therapy discontinuation. Our literature search revealed 27 patients treated for R. equi infection in the HAART era. However, details on antimicrobial treatment were given in only 3 cases. The optimal drug regimen and duration of treatment for R. equi pneumonia have not yet been established. Because drug resistance may occur during single agent therapy, it has been suggested that at least two antibiotics to which R. equi is susceptible be given. The recommended choices usually include imipenem, antipseudomonal aminoglycosides, erythromycin or azithromycin, vancomycin, rifampin, and levofloxacin. To our knowledge this is the first documented case of long term remission of R. equi pneumonia in an HIV-infected man treated with azithromycin as part of his antibiotic regimen and HAART."

In the present study, we analyzed the characteristics of CAP in 191 HIV-infected patients (192 episodes, 130 males and 61 females, mean age 32.9 years, range: 20-62) who had been admitted to Nakornping Hospital in northern Thailand between December 1996 and January 2002. The mean peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count was 68.5/mm3 (range: 0-791). The most common organisms detected in the blood of the subjects were as follows: Penicillium marneffei, 13, Salmonella spp., 5, Cryptococcus neoformans, 4, Staphylococcus aureus, 3, and Rhodococcus equi, 3, and the most common organisms detected in sputum included Haemophilus influenzae, 38, P. marneffei, 10, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 10, R. equi, 9, and S. aureus, 9. Life-threatening meningitis in 5 (cryptococcal in 3 and tuberculous in 2), pneumothorax in 2, and tuberculous lymphadenitis in 1 were also noted, resulting in 21 fatalities (10.9%). The mean peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte count for cases in which the subject died was 74.8/mm3 (range: 0-340). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high age (odds ratio of over 40 years: 15.62) and R. equi infection (odds ratio: 8.14) are related to death of HIV-infected patients with CAP. The above findings indicate that various types of organisms, including mixed organisms, cause CAP in HIV-infected patients in northern Thailand, and high age and R. equi infection seem to be risk factors for death."

SERIES SUMMARY: Two foals diagnosed with R. equi pneumonia on the basis of tracheal wash cultures, thoracic radiographs, and thoracic ultrasonography were concurrently diagnosed with hemolytic anemia. Both foals required whole blood transfusions, and were treated with the antimicrobial combination of rifampin and a macrolide (eg, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or azithromycin). Dexamethasone was used to prevent further hemolysis in both foals, and to treat acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome in 1 of the foals. Both foals survived, and required prolonged antimicrobial therapy. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: Although extra-pulmonary disorders are commonly diagnosed in foals infected with R. equi, hemolytic anemia is rarely described. Dexamethasone is considered the treatment of choice for immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, but may be contra-indicated in foals with severe bacterial infections. In these foals, a relatively low dose and short duration of dexamethasone was utilized in an attempt to minimize immune suppression, although early discontinuation in 1 foal precipitated a second hemolytic crisis."

The use of ultrasound imaging has aided in the early diagnosis of the disease, reducing treatment duration and improving therapeutic outcomes. Antimicrobial resistance in R. equi is an emerging issue that necessitates prudent antimicrobial therapy of diseased foals. Alternative methods of disease transmission, such as contagious foal-to-foal aerosol transmission, may need to be addressed to complement dust reduction environmental strategies and to minimise the overall risk of exposure of foals to highly concentrated inhaled doses of the organism. Effective management of foals and land aimed at reducing aerosol exposure to virulent R. equi is likely to yield significant reductions in the prevalence and severity of R. equi pneumonia."

Even though antiretroviral therapy has a protective effect on the risk of bacterial pneumonia, this still remains high (including those with CD(4)&gt;500/mm(3)). The most frequently isolated bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The clinical and radiological presentations of lower respiratory tract infections in HIV patients are quite variable. The clinical presentation is more severe and the radiological presentation is more atypical if the immunosuppression is severe. The first-line antibiotic therapy is an injectable third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) or co-amoxiclav. Pneumococcal vaccination (as well as influenza vaccine) is recommended.

HYPOTHESIS: There is no association between isolation of other microorganisms and outcome. ANIMALS: 155 foals with pneumonia caused by R. equi. METHODS: Case records of foals diagnosed with R. equi pneumonia based on culture of the respiratory tract were reviewed at 2 referral hospitals (University of Florida [UF] and Texas A&amp;M University [TAMU]). RESULTS: R. equi was cultured from a tracheobronchial aspirate (TBA) in 115 foals and from lung tissue in 38 foals. Survival was significantly higher at UF (71%; 70/99) than at TAMU (50%; 28/56). R. equi was significantly more likely to grow in pure cultures from samples obtained from foals at UF (55%; 54/99) than from foals at TAMU (23%; 13/56). Microorganisms cultured with R. equi included Gram-positive bacteria in 40, Gram-negative bacteria in 41, and fungi in 23 foals. The most common bacteria isolated were beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 26) and Escherichia coli (n = 18). Mixed infections were significantly more likely to be encountered in TBA than in lung tissue. Only foals from which R. equi was cultured from a TBA were included in the analysis for association between mixed infection and outcome. After adjusting for the effect of hospital using multivariate logistic regression, mixed culture, mixed bacterial culture, Gram-positive bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Gram-negative bacteria, enteric Gram-negative bacteria, nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi were not significantly associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Isolation of multiple bacteria or fungi from a TBA along with R. equi does not negatively impact prognosis."

As an example, we present a retired farmer with myeloma, treated Hodgkin-lymphoma and hypogammaglobulinemia suffering from the third episode of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia. Screening for hypogammaglobulinemia is recommended in patients with unexplained recurrent bacterial airway infection or first time opportunistic disease, particularly with micro-organisms controlled by humoral immunity. Screening should include the analysis of total immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgG and IgM). If results are ambiguous, tetanus toxoid and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be administered with measurement of specific antibody titer before and one month after vaccination. An adequate antibody response largely excludes a clinically significant humoral immunodeficiency. If hypogammaglobulinemia is present in a patient with recurrent or opportunistic infections, periodical substitution of IVIG in a dose and frequency to prevent further infectious episodes should be initiated. This is usually achieved with an IVIG-dose of 0.4g/kg body weight every 3 - 4 weeks to reach a trough IgG-level of 5 - 7g/L."

SAMPLE: Air samples collected from foaling stalls and holding pens in which foals were housed during the first 2 weeks after birth. PROCEDURES: At a breeding farm in Texas, air samples (500 L each) were collected (January through May 2011) from stalls and pens in which 121 foals were housed on day 1 and on days 4, 7, and 14 after birth. For each sample, the concentration of airborne virulent R equi was determined with an immunoblot technique. The association between development of pneumonia and airborne R equi concentration was evaluated via random-effects Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Some air samples were not available for analysis. Of the 471 air samples collected from stalls that housed 121 foals, 90 (19%) contained virulent R equi. Twenty-four of 121 (20%) foals developed R equi pneumonia. Concentrations of virulent R equi in air samples from stalls housing foals that developed R equi pneumonia were significantly higher than those in samples from stalls housing foals that did not develop pneumonia. Accounting for disease effects, air sample concentrations of virulent R equi did not differ significantly by day after birth or by month of birth. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Exposure of foals to airborne virulent R equi during the first 2 weeks after birth was significantly (and likely causally) associated with development of R equi pneumonia."

It rarely appears in humans, but the HIV/AIDS epidemic has increased the number of cases and the main affected organ is the lung. It causes pneumonia characterized by a slow clinical and radiological progression. OBJECTIVE: to describe the initial radiological alterations from R. equi infection in 8 AIDS patients, the radiological evolution and the clinical and immunological presentation. METHODS: a retrospective descriptive study of radiological pulmonary images from AIDS patients with respiratory infection due to Rhodococcus equi was conducted. RESULTS: these patients presented with high fever (39 degrees C), cough with expectoration and shortness of breath. Homogeneous opacity was the most frequent radiological presentation (62,5% of cases), located predominantly in the lower lobules. The radiological evolution was characterized by opacity with inner cavitation in 4 cases, fibrosis in 4 cases, and one case showed total recovery of lesions. The CD4+ T-cell count was low in all the patients. The evolution ranged from 2 to 33 months. CONCLUSIONS: the R equi pneumonia diagnosis should be borne in mind when dealing with HIV/AIDS patients with compromised immunological condition and breathing process with radiological manifestation of pulmonary consolidation evolving into cavitation, and torpid and prolonged clinical and radiological evolution."

R. equi is a soil-dwelling Gram-positive bacillus that frequently causes infection in grazing livestock. Human infection is rare and mostly limited to the immunocompromised hosts. We present a case of pneumonia caused by R. equi infection in a 55-year-old male builder who presented with cough, dyspnoea and night sweats, initially suspected to have pulmonary tuberculosis. Following biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes, R. equi was cultured, which is usually not a contaminant. Despite extensive investigations a host immune defect was not identified. The patient recovered after three months of combination antibiotic treatment, initially with intravenous vancomycin and meropenem followed by oral clarithromycin and rifampicin. To further clarify this rare disease we did a literature review that identified 26 adult patients with R. equi infection, without an identified host immunosuppressive condition. In this cohort, the median age at presentation was 53 years and infection holds a strong male predominance 19 (73%). An environmental exposure (e.g. farming, horse breeder) was found in 13 (50%). Ten (38%) of these patients had pulmonary infection. All deaths 3 (12%) occurred in the patients had pulmonary infection. R.equi is an infection that is difficult to diagnose and carries a high mortality if prompt treatment is not established. It is important to realise the potential for this disease to be misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis or community acquired pneumonia. Clinical suspicion is important especially if an environmental exposure is suspected. "

CASE REPORT: We reported the extremly rare case of a 43-year-old woman with Hodgkin lymphoma, who developed R equi pulmonary infection after recieving multiple courses of chemotherapy. Secondary, the patient developed bacteremia, leading to sepsis and dissemination of R equi infection in many extrapulmonary sites. At addmission the patient was febrile, tachypnoic, tachycardic, hypotensive, with fa cial edema, splenomegaly, positive meningeal signs, left hemiparesis and paraparesis. Laboratory data included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &gt; 140 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) 143.0 mg/L, red blood cells (RBC) 2.14 x 10(12)/L, whyite blood cells (WBC) 2.8 x 10(9)/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 706 U/L, serum albumin 26 g/L, sodium 127 mmol/L and potassium 2.7 mmol/L. Blood culture and culture of sputum and empyema were positive for R equi. Imaging studies demonstrated a large right cavitary pneumonia and abscess, empyema, pericarditis, mediastinal and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, brain and psoas abscesses, osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis. The patient recovered completely after a 12-month treatment with combinations of parenteral and oral antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, macrolides etc), including drainage of abscesses and empyema. Eight years after completition of the treatment the patient was without recurrence of R equi infection and lymphoma.

It is a common veterinary pathogen; however, the incidence of this infection in humans has risen and it has been recognised as an emerging opportunistic pathogen among the immunocompromised patients. We present the case of a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia who had received allogenic stem cell transplant and presented to the hospital with clinical picture of pneumonia.

Recent protocols for diagnosis and treatment of Rhodococcosis in foals typically rely on a multimodal approach based on sonographic evidence suggestive of pyogranulomas, sonographic abscess scores and laboratory findings including plasma fibrinogen concentrations, blood biochemistry testing and platelet and leukocyte counts. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of weekly testing of serum amyloid A (SAA) and plasma fibrinogen concentrations in foals to achieve early diagnosis of R. equi pneumonia prior to the onset of clinical signs. This testing was used to simulate a clinically practical screening procedure and compared with thoracic ultrasonography performed in parallel. The present study suggests that SAA does not represent a reliable early marker of Rhodococcosis when plasma concentrations are tested weekly. However, when clinical signs of R. equi pneumonia are present, SAA concentrations may allow clinicians to obtain 'real-time' indications concerning both the progress of infection and the effectiveness of therapy. This study raises the possibility that plasma fibrinogen monitoring starting at 1 week of age and repeated on a weekly basis, could serve as a screening test allowing clinicians to identify foals as suspected of R. equi infection. Future investigations regarding both physiological plasma fibrinogen concentrations in foals as well as fibrinogen kinetics in foals affected with R. equi pneumonia, including the establishment of appropriate reference intervals for the test method employed in this study, will be necessary in order to clarify this possibility."

Because diphtheroids are regarded as part of normal respiratory flora, the importance of R. equi as a pulmonary pathogen may not be fully appreciated and its prevalence may be underestimated. Most treatment recommendations for R. equi infection were established before antiretroviral drugs became available for human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS therapy, and therapeutic strategies may need to be updated. OBJECTIVES: To review the role of R. equi as a cause of pulmonary infection; to highlight its importance for clinicians and microbiologists; and to challenge current approaches to treatment, whether in immunodeficient or immunocompetent individuals. SOURCES: A PubMed search using combinations of the following terms: 'Rhodococcus (automatically including Corynebacterium) equi' AND 'pneumonia' OR 'pulmonary' infection, then cross-checking references in the resulting cases, case series and reviews. CONTENT: We provide a review that details the challenges in the diagnosis, microbiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary infection caused by R. equi and the options for treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Ten to 14 days of treatment may be effective for pneumonia due to R. equi. Our review suggests that longer courses of therapy are needed for cavitary lesions and lung masses. However, recommendations for excessively prolonged treatment of all pulmonary infections arose during a time when many cases occurred in individuals with AIDS and before effective antiretroviral therapy was available.

Samples were included if the R. equi bacterium was cultured and tested for in vitro susceptibility to erythromycin or rifampin. In vitro susceptibility testing to erythromycin was available for 2,169 isolates of R. equi, while susceptibility testing to both erythromycin and rifampin was available for 1,681 isolates. Rifampin resistance was first detected in 2000, and erythromycin resistance was first detected in 2004. Between 1995 and 2006, the proportion of resistant isolates of R. equi was 0.7% for erythromycin and 2.3% for rifampin. There was a significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase in the proportion of resistant R. equi between 2007 and 2017, with 13.6% of isolates being resistant to erythromycin and 16.1% being resistant to rifampin. Between 2007 and 2017, isolates of R. equi resistant to erythromycin or rifampin were significantly less likely to be isolated from feces than from the respiratory tract, other soft tissues, or musculoskeletal infections. The considerable increase in the prevalence of isolates of R. equi resistant to macrolides and rifampin since 2007 is of concern for both human and animal health."

R. equi infections are rare opportunistic illnesses in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), associated with a high mortality rate. The most common clinical presentation of R. equi infections is a chronic cavitary pneumonia. Due to its acid-fastness, R. equi can be mistaken for others acid-fast organisms, as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In turn, R. equi is also a gram-positive pleomorphic bacteria and can be mistaken for diphtheroids or Micrococcus organisms, being accidentally disregarded as oral contaminants in sputum cultures. Therefore, in Brazil, a highly prevalent tuberculosis (TB) country, pulmonary infections caused by R. equi may mimic pulmonary TB and represent a diagnostic challenge. Here, we report on a case of chronic cavitary pneumonia by R. equi in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patient, focusing on diagnostic aspects."

R equi generally causes pnumonia that may evolve into fatal systemic infection if left untreated. Here, we present a case of a 67-year-old woman affected by acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) who developed R equi pneumonia 7 months after kidney transplantation. Although clinical features at presentation were nonspecific, lung computed tomography showed right perihilar consolidation with a mass-like appearance causing bronchial obstruction. Appropriate antibiotic including intravenous meropenem and oral azithromycin that was then switched to oral levofloxacin and oral azithromycin along with reduction of immunosuppressive therapy resolved pneumonia without provoking an acute attack of porphyria. AIP limited the choice of antibiotics for the treatment of R equi infection because some potentially porphyrinogenic antibacterial agents were avoided. Based on this experience, azithromycin and meropenem can be safely administered for the treatment of R Equi infection in patients with AIP."

ANIMALS STUDIED: Foals diagnosed with R equi infection at the VTH-UAB from January 2002 to December 2017. PROCEDURE: Rhodococcus equi infection was diagnosed by means of clinical signs, radiographic/ultrasonographic findings, and/or positive culture. In all the foals, a complete ophthalmic examination by a boarded ophthalmologist was performed and ocular signs were recorded and graded (0-4). RESULTS: Thirty-nine foals were included in the study, from which 12 showed signs of bilateral anterior uveitis (30.8%). Among these, three foals were classified as mildly uveitis-affected (MUA:7.7%) and nine as severely uveitis-affected (SUA:23.1%). Five SUA foals showed green aqueous flare (5/9;55.5%). Despite the systemic treatment, 9/39 sick foals died (23.1%), the fatality rate being different between groups: SUA (4/9;44.4%), MUA (0/3; 0%) and nonuveitis-affected foals (5/27;18.5%). Among SUA foals, only one with green aqueous flare died (1/5;20%). CONCLUSION: Bilateral anterior uveitis is highly prevalent in foals with R equi pneumonia (30.8%). The severity of anterior uveitis might be considered a nonsurvival prognostic factor and, until proven otherwise, green aqueous flare could be taken as a strongly suggestive ocular sign of the disease. Findings of this study remark the clinical relevance of performing a complete ophthalmic examination in sick foals, in order to help in the diagnosis and prognosis of uveal diseases, as well as to guaranteeing visual soundness."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether targeted treatment protocols resulting in decreased antimicrobial use impact foal mortality rates. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty foals with pneumonia per year were randomly selected from 2008 to 2016. All foals were examined once weekly from birth until weaning. A physical examination of the respiratory tract, body temperature, haematology and an ultrasonographic examination of the lungs were included. Sonography areas with visible consolidation were measured and added to calculate an ""abscess score"" which represents the extent of pulmonary damage. All weekly medical data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the period from 2008 to 2011, every foal with pulmonary abscesses was treated. The treatment protocol was changed in 2012 when only foals with larger lesions were treated. Between the two time periods 2008-2011 and 2012-2016, the abscess score at the beginning of treatment increased from a median of 4 to 11.5 cm. From all foals that developed R. equi pneumonia, 81.5% received antibiotic treatment in 2008-2011 (n = 1215) compared to 50.9% in 2012-2016 (n = 1541). The percentage of foals that died from pneumonia or R. equi infections did not differ significantly between 2008-2011 and 2012-2016 (0.4% versus 0.6%, respectively; P = 0.6). MAIN LIMITATIONS: There was some lack of clarity in old data because this was a retrospective study; therefore, some foals had to be excluded from data analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of treatment criteria, to exclude antibiotic treatment of foals with smaller lesions, has significantly decreased the number of foals being treated without a significant increase in mortality from R. equi pneumonia."

It is estimated that approximately 10% of the infections occur in immunocompetent patients, whereas the rest are immune deficient, targeting virtually any organ. Histologically, malakoplakia is characterized by the buildup of infiltrated inflammatory tissue as a consequence of the gathering of histiocytes embedded with concentric inclusions. The diagnosis relies on the cultures and the susceptibility testing as well as the pathologic findings compatible with the disease. Case Presentation. We present a 25-year-old male patient with persistent nonproductive cough for over a year and with weight loss, who comes to the emergency department with recent fever, swollen and tender lymph nodes, and hemoptysis. The patient gets diagnosed and treated for Rhodococcus equi-related pulmonary malakoplakia. Conclusion: Knowing the involvement of Rhodococcus in HIV is fundamental for the diagnosis and optimal treatment, which although unknown, a combination of antibiotics with intracellular penetration, on-time resection, and a proper immune reconstitution represents the best approach. Prognosis varies with mortality rates from 34% to 54%."

METHODS: Forty cats aged between 2 months and 11 years old (median 6 months) that were definitively diagnosed with rhodococcosis between 2012 and 2018 were recruited in this study. Medical records were reviewed for information on signalment, history, clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, treatment plans and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 40 cats, 36 showed the pulmonary form of the disease, with 35 (87.5%) presented with dyspnoea, while four cats presented with only cutaneous lesions. Mean body temperature was 38.7 +- 0.2 C. Dyspnoea was noted in 87.5% of the cats. Leukocytosis (58.3%) with band neutrophilia (83.3%), monocytosis (58.3%) and thrombocytopenia (55.5%) were prominent findings in the haematology reports. Hyperproteinaemia (61.1%) with hypoalbuminaemia (22.2%) and hyperglobulinaemia (63.8%) with a low albumin to globulin ratio (38.9%) were prominent features of blood biochemistry reports. An alveolar-interstitial pattern was noted in 75% of pre-thoracocentesis radiographs. Pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, thoracic lymphadenopathy and atelectasis of any lung lobe were seen in 88.9%, 75%, 41.7% and 36.1% of cats, respectively. Overall, the mortality rate was 67.5% in both forms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinicians should be aware that feline rhodococcosis manifests as a pulmonary disease at a much higher rate than previously reported. Further studies are required to address the epidemiology, pathophysiology, disease management and prognosis of feline rhodococcosis.

It typically causes pulmonary disease, but it can also cause extrapulmonary disease. Immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk of developing the infection, but it has been reported in individuals with competent immune system as well. We present a unique case of infectious endocarditis (IE) due to a R. equi infection in an immunocompetent patient. A 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, systolic heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery for coronary and valvular heart disease. His transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe aortic stenosis and multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and simultaneous aortic valve replacement. Intraoperatively, there was exudative material covering his aortic valve, which was sent for tissue culture. Tissue culture was positive for R. equi and Enterococcus faecium.  R. equi endocarditis is a rare presentation of this organism. R. equi endocarditis is a very challenging diagnosis due to its varying presentation compared to typical IE. Detailed history taking and physical exam are extremely important to determine if further evaluation is needed. Prolonged oral and intravenous antibiotics are recommended for effective treatment."

This opportunistic bacterium is related to miscellaneous pyogenic infections in animals. Most studies involving T. pyogenes are case reports, whereas few surveys have focused the major aspects of T. pyogenes infections involving a case series study design. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate selected epidemiological and clinical aspects, as well as the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of 144 cases of T. pyogenes infections among domestic animals from 2002 to 2012. ANIMALS AND METHODS: T. pyogenes was isolated from different clinical specimens from cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, horses, dogs, and buffaloes. Correlations were assessed by the Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Mastitis (45.1%), abscesses (18.0%), pneumonia (11.1%), and lymphadenitis (9.0%) were the most common clinical manifestations. In addition, the organism was also isolated from other miscellaneous clinical specimens from cases of septicemia, encephalitis, pyometra, prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, pericarditis, and omphalitis. No statistical association was observed between T. pyogenes infections and age, gender, or season across the study. The most effective drugs against the pathogen were florfenicol (99.1%), cefoperazone (96.0%), cephalexin (95.0%), and ceftiofur (94.8%). High resistance rates were observed against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (49.3%), followed by norfloxacin (10.9%) and tetracycline (9.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the diversity of clinical manifestations and the opportunistic behavior of T. pyogenes infections in domestic animals, with predominance of mastitis, abscesses, pneumonia, and lymphadenitis. It also reinforces the importance of knowing the susceptibility profile before initiating therapy, to improve antimicrobial therapy approaches."

Most bacterial upper respiratory tract infections are vaccine preventable. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of carrier state of bacterial upper respiratory tract pathogens among school children. It also aimed to study their antibiograms. METHODS: The specimen from posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsils were collected from 204 participants on calcium alginate coated swabs (HiMedia). Isolates were identified by standard microbiological methods and tested for in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: In this study, Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%) was the most common bacterial pathogen recovered, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14.7%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (non-Group A) (8.8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5.3%) and Corynebacterium diphtheriae (3.4%). The Gram negative bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.4%) and Neisseria meningitidis (1.4%). Important findings in antibiogram include high resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin (91.17%) and resistance of S. aureus to oxacillin (23.3%). CONCLUSION: Pharyngeal colonisation by S. pneumoniae was found high among school children and this calls for an urgent need to include pneumococcal vaccine in routine national immunisation schedule of Nepal given the high burden of invasive pneumococcal disease. Despite expected universal vaccination, pharyngeal colonisation by C. diphtheriae is possible and there is possibility of transmission of these respiratory pathogens to other healthy children."

Both Actinomyces and Nocardia cause similar clinical syndromes involving the lung, bone and joint, soft tissue, and the central nervous system. The medically important Actinomyces organisms cause infections characterized by chronic progression, abscess formation with fistulous tracts and draining sinuses. Called ""great masqueraders,"" diagnosis of actinomycosis and nocardiosis is often delayed. Once recognized, treatment of these infections requires long courses of parenteral and oral therapy. This review will compare and contrast infections due to Actinomyces and Nocardia."

","SPECIES:Tsukamurella strandjordiID:20503156TITLE:[Filamentous ""contaminants"" in the mycobacteriology laboratory; their culture, identification and clinical significance].ABSTRACT:Frequent ""contaminants"" detected during mycobacterial culture of decontaminated samples are bacteria of the order Actinomycetales. These are usually bacteria classified as the family Corynebacterineae, genera Corynebacterium, Dietzia, Gordonia, Nocardia, Rhodococcus and Tsukamurella. These bacteria frequently colonize the airways and, under certain circumstances, they may cause life-threatening diseases. In severely immunocompromised patients, they regularly cause life-threatening infections with bacteria of the genus Nocardia. These filamentous bacteria, developing aerial mycelium in the culture, are partly acid-resistant and resistant to lysozyme. They cause nocardiosis, a rare but serious disease in patients with various types of immune deficiency. Differential diagnosis must distinguish between the genera Streptomyces, Actinomadura and Nocardiopsis and other soil saprophytes that are not acid-resistant, sensitive to lysozyme and faster growing. They frequently colonize the airways of patients with lung disease but very rarely cause diseases. The diagnosis of aerobic actinomycetes and determination of their sensitivity to antibiotics are problematic since they grow longer, are difficult to stain and are involved in atypical biochemical reactions. Precise identification of the genera and species requires polyphasic identification of isolates using molecular microbiology methods. If diagnosed early, infections caused by aerobic actinomycetes are easy to treat with targeted antibiotic therapy."

We report the first case of bilateral SPE secondary to a central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection involving pathogens commonly considered environmental contaminants: Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens and Rhizobium radiobacter. Empirical levofloxacin treatment was confirmed by in vitro susceptibility data and produced prompt clinical improvement, but removal of the infected line proved indispensable for eradication of the infection.

To obtain information of the species and characterization of pathogens involved in NTM pulmonary infection in Southern-central China, we identified 160 non-tuberculous infection cases from 3995 acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive tuberculous suspects. We then randomly selected 101 non-tuberculous patients, isolated bacteria from their sputa and genotyped the pathogens using the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequences. M. intracellulare (32.67%, 33/101), M. abscessus (32.67%, 33/101) and M. fortuitum (7.92%, 8/101) are identified in these isolates. Surprisingly, non-mycobacteria including Gordonia (8.91%, 9/101), Nocardia (5.94%, 6/101) and Tsukamurella (0.99%, 1/101) are also discovered, and the case of Tsukamurella pulmonis infection is first discovered in Southern-central China. Moreover, species of M. mucogenicum group, M. chubuense, M. kansasii, M. gastri, M. avium, M. porcinum and M. smegmatis are identified. In addition, nine immune compromised cases (8.91%, 9/101), including type two diabetes mellitus and HIV/AIDS are found to be infected with non-tuberculous bacteria. This study revealed the distribution and characteristics of non-tuberculous AFB pathogen infection occurred in Southern-central China, and suggested that physicians should be alert of the emerging of NTM and non-mycobacteria infection in AFB positive cases and take caution when choosing chemotherapy for tuberculosis-like pulmonary infections. Generally, this study may help with the development of new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infection. "

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of persistent fever with general malaise. His medical history showed that he had diabetes mellitus (HbA1C 9.2%). A chest computed tomography (CT) showed left upper lung consolidation . Two sets of blood culture at admission finally showed Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens. Moreover, three transbronchoscopy washing specimen cultures revealed Mycobacterium bovis. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The organism Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens was identified using conventional biochemical identification methods, PCR-restriction DNA fragment analysis, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The clinical mycobacterial isolates were identified to the species level by combining Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with an oligonucleotide microarray to detect the M. bovis amplicons. CONCLUSION: According to our literature review, our patient's case was the first of a coinfection with Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens and Mycobacterium bovis. Prolonged antibiotic treatment and underlying disease control are necessary for this type of patient."

The patient was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis and was treated for nearly 9 months. The correct diagnosis was suspected only when the results of mycobacteria nucleic acid amplification tests on cultural colonies were negative. Tsukamurella was identified from the patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by using 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Here, the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment strategies of Tsukamurella pneumonia are discussed, along with a literature review. Tsukamurella pneumonia may be highly underdiagnosed owing to its similarity with pulmonary tuberculosis and the habitual thinking of doctors in countries with a high tuberculosis burden. Tsukamurella should be carefully considered in the etiology of tuberculosis-like lung diseases."

On admission, she had malaise and low-grade fever, and was found to have microscopic hematuria, urinary red blood cell casts, multiple pulmonary nodules, and positivity of proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA), which were suggestive to the presence of ANCA-associated small vessel vasculitis. However, her blood culture and subsequent gene analysis revealed the positivity of Tsukamurella pulmonis, and she was diagnosed with Tsukamurella pulmonis bacteremia accompanying PR3-ANCA positivity. Her condition improved after the removal of the catheter and antibiotic treatment. Tsukamurella species are categorized to the order Actinomycetales and can be misidentified as other Actinomycetales without genetic analyses. This case illustrates that chronic Tsukamurella pulmonis infection can cause ANCA production and nephritis, which mimics ANCA-associated vasculitis. Thus, it is critical to diagnose these cases correctly to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, such as immunosuppressive treatment."

","SPECIES:Tsukamurella strandjordiID:33036892TITLE:Septic pulmonary emboli caused by Tsukamurella inchonensis: A case report.ABSTRACT:The genus Tsukamurella is a fastidious, environmental organism that potentially causes various infections in humans. Due to the morphological and biochemical similarities to others pathogens, such as Gordona, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, Nocardia, and Mycobacterium, a molecular-based approach is indispensable to correctly identify them. Herein, we describe a case of Tsukamurella inchonensis bacteremia complicated with septic pulmonary emboli (SPE), which is the first in the literature. A 44-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with tongue cancer had undergone partial tongue resection. While receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she developed high fever. Chest computed tomography suggested multiple emboli at the bilateral, peripheral lungs, indicating SPE. Blood culture detected Gram-positive rods, to which matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry failed to identify. Then, we attempted to characterize it by 16S rRNA sequence, which suggested the organism to be Tsukamurella species but resulted in low resonance of the species-level identification. Additionally, we employed a confidence gene targeting groEL, leading to 100% matching (753/753 bps) with T. inchonensis NCTC 10741 (GenBank accession no. LR131273.1), which has been incorrectly registered as wrong species name Tsukamurella paurometabola in the database. Under the diagnosis of T. inchonensis-associated SPE, we successfully treated the patient with imipenem/cilastatin administration for 4 weeks. Sequencing analysis of groEL was of great use in identifying the organism in this case. More clinical cases based on molecular diagnosis of the fastidious pathogens need to be accumulated to further understand the characteristics and appropriate treatment regimen."
