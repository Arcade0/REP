MycobacteriumFortuitum is often responsible, and the clinical's presentation   is an aspiration pneumonia resistant to usual antibiotic therapy. We report the case of a 15 year-old patient with the history of Allgrove syndrome. The chest imaging showed right lung congestion; the diagnosis was bacteriological and MycobacteriumFortuitum resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol was isolated. The patient was treated by the association cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin for 12 months and the clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes were favorable. To prevent the recurrence the patient benefited from a cardiomyotomy."

","SPECIES:ActinobacteriaID:30456869TITLE:The importance of early diagnosis of Mycobacterium abscessus complex in patients with cystic fibrosis.ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium abscessus complex can cause severe lung infections and has proven to be a serious threat to patients with cystic fibrosis and a challenge for clinicians due to difficulties in timely diagnosis and complex multidrug treatment regimes. Mycobacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but in most cystic fibrosis centers it is performed less frequently than culture for other pathogens. Consensus today recommends just one annual mycobacterial culture for asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, a strategy likely to lead to diagnostic delays. Postponement of diagnosis might be the deciding factor in whether an early colonization turns into chronic infection. This review highlights the latest developments in knowledge about the pathogenicity and clinical consequences of M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease, addressing the central theme of why pulmonary infection requires early identification and aggressive antibiotic treatment. The window of opportunity, before M. abscessus complex transforms from a mucosal colonizer to a chronic biofilm infection, is where microbial eradication is most likely to be successful, making early diagnosis essential for improved outcomes."

","SPECIES:ActinobacteriaID:30462797TITLE:Chronic cavitary pneumonia by Rhodococcus equi in a highly prevalent tuberculosis country: a diagnosis challenge.ABSTRACT:Rhodococcus equi is a facultative aerobic, intracellular, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive, weakly acid-fast coccobacillus belonging to the group of nocardioform actinomycetes. R. equi infections are rare opportunistic illnesses in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), associated with a high mortality rate. The most common clinical presentation of R. equi infections is a chronic cavitary pneumonia. Due to its acid-fastness, R. equi can be mistaken for others acid-fast organisms, as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In turn, R. equi is also a gram-positive pleomorphic bacteria and can be mistaken for diphtheroids or Micrococcus organisms, being accidentally disregarded as oral contaminants in sputum cultures. Therefore, in Brazil, a highly prevalent tuberculosis (TB) country, pulmonary infections caused by R. equi may mimic pulmonary TB and represent a diagnostic challenge. Here, we report on a case of chronic cavitary pneumonia by R. equi in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patient, focusing on diagnostic aspects."

This study evaluated the level of diphtheria (DT) and pertussis (PT)-related antibodies among children with pneumonia in Ji'nan, China. METHODS: A total of 484 sera of children from 1 day to 13 years of age were collected from 2014 to 2015 in Ji'nan. Children with recent history of pertussis were excluded from this study. Anti-DT and PT IgG concentrations were measured by ELISA (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). RESULTS: Of the 484 subjects tested, the overall positivity rate of anti-DT IgG (&gt;=0.1 IU/ml) was 48.97%, and the highest positivity rate of anti-DT IgG (68.55%) and proportion with long term protection (23.27%) were observed in children aged 6 m- &lt; 3 y. For anti-PT IgG, 334 subjects (69.01%) had anti-PT IgG levels below the lower limit of detection (5 IU/ml). Even with detectable anti-PT antibodies, the majority (115/150, 76.67%) of them had antibody levels of 5- &lt; 40 IU/ml. The highest proportion of subjects with detectable anti-PT IgG (&gt;=5 IU/ml) was observed in children aged &lt; 6 m (44.36%), then the proportion continually decreased to 15.0% at 3 y- &lt; 6 y (chi2 = 24.05, p &lt; 0.0001). The highest positivity rate (&gt;=40 IU/ml) was only 8.27% in children aged &lt; 6 m. Subjects with an anti-PT IgG &gt;=100 IU/ml were observed in all the groups and there were no significant differences in the proportions of subjects with a level &gt;= 100 IU/ml among these age groups (chi2 = 2.572, p = 0.4624). A total of 5 subjects had anti-PT IgG &gt;=100 IU/ml (&gt;=1 years post pertussis vaccination) which was considered to be indicative of a recent pertussis infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated low antibody levels and protection against pertussis in our study population. The anti-PT IgG maintained a low level throughout all age groups, and even no immune responses were observed after the basic immunization and booster. Our study supported the need to reevaluate the immune response of DTP vaccine which was used in Shandong province after 2010."

However, the distribution of the etiology of CAP varies from one country to another, with limited data from rural areas. METHODS: A prospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Leyte, Central Philippines from May 2010 to May 2012. Blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal samples obtained from patients were used to identify pathogens using standard microbiological culture methods and PCR. RESULTS: Of the 535 patients enrolled, 38% were younger than 50 years old. More than half of the patients had an underlying disease, including pulmonary tuberculosis (22%). The detection rate was higher for bacteria (40%) than viruses (13%). Haemophilus influenzae (12%) was the most commonly detected bacterium and influenza virus (5%) was the most commonly detected virus. The proportion of CAP patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was higher in the younger age group than in the older age group. Among CAP patients, 14% died during hospitalization, and drowsiness on admission and SpO2 &lt;90% were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections contribute substantially to the number of hospitalizations among CAP patients in rural Philippines. This study also highlights the importance of treatment of tuberculosis in reducing the burden of adult CAP in the country."

In the present case, symptoms and chest infiltrative shadow initially improved by tosufloxacin. Therefore, we regarded this patient as having general pneumonia and did not perform follow-up chest X-ray until the infiltrates had completely disappeared. However, a few weeks later, the symptoms and the infiltrates had worsened, so M. tuberculosis was isolated from the patient's sputum. This case suggests that patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis should be monitored carefully, even if antibiotics without antituberculous activity are initially effective."

R equi generally causes pnumonia that may evolve into fatal systemic infection if left untreated. Here, we present a case of a 67-year-old woman affected by acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) who developed R equi pneumonia 7 months after kidney transplantation. Although clinical features at presentation were nonspecific, lung computed tomography showed right perihilar consolidation with a mass-like appearance causing bronchial obstruction. Appropriate antibiotic including intravenous meropenem and oral azithromycin that was then switched to oral levofloxacin and oral azithromycin along with reduction of immunosuppressive therapy resolved pneumonia without provoking an acute attack of porphyria. AIP limited the choice of antibiotics for the treatment of R equi infection because some potentially porphyrinogenic antibacterial agents were avoided. Based on this experience, azithromycin and meropenem can be safely administered for the treatment of R Equi infection in patients with AIP."

The incidence of these tumors is increasing, but disease awareness remains low among clinicians. The synchronous presentation of lung cancer and mycobacterial infection is well known but the combination of pulmonary carcinoid and mycobacterial infection is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a 45-year-old female who presented with recurrent pneumonia. Chest X-ray showed a consolidation in the left upper lobe. The patient was treated with various courses of antibiotics without full recovery after six months. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a central mass in the left upper lobe. Bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial, well-defined lesion that totally obstructed the left upper lobe bronchus. Bronchial biopsy showed typical carcinoid tumor. Rigid bronchoscopy with electrocautery was attempted, but we were unable to radically remove the tumor. Therefore lobectomy was performed. The surgical pathology specimen showed atypical bronchial carcinoid and consolidations in the lung parenchyma with granulomatous inflammation distally of the bronchial obstruction. Ziehl-Neelsen staining demonstrated acid fast bacilli indicative of mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case history illustrates the importance of careful surgical pathologic examination, not only of the resected tumor, but also of the postobstructive lung parenchyma. Specific postobstructive infections such as tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can have clinical implications."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinicoradiological features of pulmonary tuberculosis associated with IP. Methods In this retrospective, observational, single-center study, the medical charts, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings, and bacteriological test results of patients with IP who also tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were reviewed. Patients The study included 20 patients with IP out of 329 who tested positive for M. tuberculosis in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures at Toranomon Hospital between January 2006 and December 2017. Results The HRCT patterns were usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) in 11 patients and non-UIP in 9 patients. Consolidations (80%) were the most frequent HRCT findings, followed by cavities (60%) and nodules (45%), which are generally characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis. Consolidations often developed in relation to fibrotic or emphysematous lesions. Tuberculosis lesions could not be identified in one patient. All patients were treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs according to WHO guidelines, and 13 patients achieved a WHO category of ""Treatment success."" No patient died of tuberculosis, and the median survival time for the 20 patients was 1,196 days. Conclusion Although the HRCT findings for pulmonary tuberculosis associated with IP are atypical, appropriate tuberculosis treatments can lead to favorable outcomes."

We describe a recent case of silicone embolism syndrome occurring together with systemic tuberculosis in a transgendered patient newly diagnosed with AIDS. She presented with fever, hematochezia, lymphadenopathies, purple nodular lesions and lower limb edema. HIV test was positive. A chest X-Ray showed interstitial infiltrates and a tomography showed necrotic lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules with blurred borders, suggesting Kaposi sarcoma. Psychomotor impairment then occurred in the absence of tomographic signs of acute neurological events. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome was isolated from stool and bronchial washing samples. Histological examination of a necrotic lymph node showed lymphoadenopathy due to silicone accumulation. Moreover, the patient presented fever and swelling of lower limbs; a tomography showed multiple foreign body granulomas. After starting antitubercular, antiretroviral and antibiotic treatment she reported symptomatic improvement including a mild recovery of motor-slowing. There are few reports about silicone-induced pulmonary disease in HIV-1 infected patients and, as far as we know, none of them describes an overlapping pulmonary involvement due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Even if extensive clinical and radiologic evidence is suggestive of Kaposi sarcoma (fever, severe immunodeficiency, multiple cutaneous nodules, hematochezia, diffuse lymphoadenopathies), it is possible to see Kaposi-like manifestations in patients with systemic silicone embolization. With this article we wish to stress the attention on the possible overlap of more than one concurrent disease in an immunocompromised host."

In addition, CT images of easily confused pulmonary lesions superimposed on kidney diseases were also retrieved from our depository. Moreover, impaired renal function as a risk factor for infection and pharmacological options for the treatment were also focused. By sharing our hard-learnt experience and reviewing the literatures, our report may contribute to the awareness among the clinicians in general and nephrologists in particular of this rare disease in susceptible patients and facilitate a swift thus life-saving treatment."

Hospitalised children are low-hanging fruit for TB case detection as they are within the system. We aimed to explore the process of recognition and investigation for childhood TB using a guideline-linked cascade of care. METHODS: This was an observational study of 42,107 children admitted to 13 county hospitals in Kenya from 01Nov 15-31Oct 16, and 01Nov 17-31Oct 18. We estimated those that met each step of the cascade, those with an apparent (or ""Working"") TB diagnosis and modelled associations with TB tests amongst guideline-eligible children. RESULTS: 23,741/42,107 (56.4%) met step 1 of the cascade (&gt;=2 signs and symptoms suggestive of TB). Step 2(further screening of history of TB contact/full respiratory exam) was documented in 14,873/23,741 (62.6%) who met Step 1. Step 3(chest x-ray or Mantoux test) was requested in 2,451/14,873 (16.5%) who met Step 2. Step 4(&gt;=1 bacteriological test) was requested in 392/2,451 (15.9%) who met Step 3. Step 5(""Working TB"" diagnosis) was documented in 175/392 (44.6%) who met Step 4. Factors associated with request of TB tests in patients who met Step 1 included: i) older children [AOR 1.19(CI 1.09-1.31)]; ii) co-morbidities of HIV, malnutrition or pneumonia [AOR 3.81(CI 3.05-4.75), 2.98(CI 2.69-3.31) and 2.98(CI 2.60-3.40) respectively]; iii) sicker children, readmitted/referred [AOR 1.24(CI 1.08-1.42) and 1.15(CI 1.04-1.28) respectively]. ""Working TB"" diagnosis was made in 2.9%(1,202/42,107) of all admissions and 0.2%(89/42,107) were bacteriologically-confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of all paediatric admissions had symptoms associated with TB and nearly two-thirds had more specific history documented. Only a few amongst them got TB tests requested. TB was diagnosed in 2.9% of all admissions but most were inadequately investigated.

METHODS: Retrospective survey was carried out in the patients with mechanical ventilation who combined with NTM pulmonary disease admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from May 2016 to May 2019. The general information, basic diseases, symptoms, signs, biochemical examinations, acid-fast stain test, mycobacterium culture and strain identification results, and chest CT data were collected to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease. RESULTS: There were 12 patients with mechanical ventilation combined with NTM pulmonary disease, 6 males and 6 females, 37-82 years old, with an average age of 65 years. In these 12 cases, patients with cancer (lung cancer were 4 cases, mediastinal tumor was 1 case) and after lung transplantation (use of anti-rejection drugs at the same time) were 5 and 2 respectively. Patients with at least 3 underlying diseases [included hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, chronic renal insufficiency] were 5. Clinical symptoms of the 12 cases were non-specific. The CT findings were not characteristic, including nodules, patchy infiltrations and fibrous streak. Pleural effusion was common among these subjects but nodular bronchiectatic patterns were absence. Routine laboratory indicators of bacterial infection were non-specific. But the number of lymphocytes of all cases decreased. Mycobacteria cultures were positive with the rapid growth of mycobacteria in these 12 cases. Mycobacterium avium (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae (4 cases), Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex (2 cases) and Mycobacterium intracellulare (2 cases) were isolated. Anti-NTM therapy was given to the patients when the acid-fast staining test of their airway secretion was positive and the TB-DNA test was negative, including oral levofloxacin and clarithromycin. Finally, all patients were successfully weaned and discharged from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of NTM patients with pulmonary disease are non-specific, and the imaging features of chest CT are varied. Patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU, who have the risk of immune dysfunction or underlying structural lung diseases, and who have difficult controlled lung infection, accompanied by pleural effusion and with decreased lymphocytes, should be aware that pneumonia may be caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria."

METHODS: Retrospective observational analysis of clinical and microbiological data collected from 55 cases ofNocardia pneumonia. RESULTS: From 1 to 20 cases per hospital and from 6 to 9 cases per year were observed. COPD, bronchiectasis and asthma were the main respiratory underlying predisposing conditions. Thirty-four patients were receiving systemic and/or inhaled corticosteroids prior to infection, 8 had neoplasias and 6 hematologic malignancies. Clinical and radiological findings were common to pneumonia of other infectious aetiologies except for the frequent presence of nodules and cavitation. Overall 1 year mortality (38.2%) was high, in 15 patients (27.3%) directly related to the pulmonary disease. The most frequently-identified species were N. cyriacigeorgica (n = 21), N. abscessus (n = 8), and N. farcinica (n = 5). All Nocardia isolates were linezolid-susceptible and all but two amikacin- and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-susceptible. CONCLUSION: Still today,Nocardia pneumonia-associated mortality is high probably because of the debilitated status of patients in whom this pathogen is able to cause pulmonary infection."

Several studies have linked IgG4-RD to infections such as tuberculosis and actinomycosis. However, the coexistence of IgG4-RD and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) in a single pulmonary nodule has not been reported yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old male patient presented with cough and sputum. A solitary pulmonary nodule suspicious of lung cancer was found on chest CT. DIAGNOSIS: Through video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy, a diagnosis of co-existing NTM and IgG4-RD in a single nodule was made. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment was applied for pneumonia developed after surgery. The patient was also supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation since his pneumonia was refractory to medical treatment. OUTCOMES: The patient expired on the 60th postoperative day due to multiple organ failure. LESSONS: IgG4-RD can occur singularly or accompanied by other diseases. We report a solitary pulmonary nodule caused by NTM and concurrent IgG4-RD, suggesting a possible association between these 2 entities. Immunologic relations between IgG4-RD and accompanying infection should be further investigated."

We report that 2 of 4 pediatric patients with malignancy who were diagnosed with Micrococcus spp. infection by conventional methods were finally revealed to have Kytococcus schroeteri and Kocuria marina infection by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis (16S rRNA analysis). Although K. schroeteri is morphologically similar to Micrococcus spp., its drug susceptibility profile is quite different from that of Micrococcus spp. K. schroeteri is resistant to penicillin and cephalosporin, which are effective for Micrococcus spp. In fact, penicillin-resistant lethal pneumonia caused by K. schroeteri has been reported in compromised hosts. Based on our results, Micrococcus spp. determined by conventional methods could contain other life-threatening bacteria with different drug susceptibility patterns from Micrococcus spp. To develop an effective empirical treatment for immunocompromised hosts, accumulation of pathogen data by 16S rRNA analysis is required."

In this study, we compared the differences in chest CT findings and their locations between cases of PTB and Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (MACLD). METHODS: The subjects were 100 MACLD patients and 42 PTB patients treated at our hospital from May 2005 to August 2015. The CT findings were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: PTB more frequently showed lung shadows with calcification inside the lesion, calcification of the mediastinal/hilar lymph node, and pleural effusion on CT than MACLD, while extensive bronchiectasis and granular/large shadows connected to bronchiectasis were more frequently observed with MACLD than PTB. For cavitary lesions, the thinnest part of the cavity wall with MACLD was thinner than that with PTB. Granular shadows, large shadows, and bronchiectasis were typically distributed to the right upper lobe and left upper division in PTB cases vs. the right intermediate lobe and left lingula in MACLD. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT findings would therefore be useful for distinguishing PTB and MACLD when typical findings are observed."

The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations."

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics."

Corynebacterium species are Gram-positive bacilli, which can cause pneumonia and have been reported as causative pathogens of lower respiratory tract infections since the 1970's. However, Corynebacterium spp. may be recognized and sorted as part of normal respiratory flora on Gram staining and culture, resulting in clinical under-recognition as pathogenic bacteria. The results of the clone library method using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis in Japanese patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia revealed that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the lung lesions contained 11.8% Corynebacterium spp., which was the second most predominant bacterial phylotype. Additionally, among patients in whom Corynebacterium spp. were detected, C. simulans was most commonly detected followed by C. striatum. In addition, almost half of the patients in whom C. simulans was detected was monophylotypic infection and/or co-detection of C. simulansand C. striatum. Further clinical information is expected on corynebacteria as pathogens of lower respiratory tract infection."

No study has ever focused on its clinical relevance in the lower respiratory tract of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation. The aims were to describe the characteristics of ICU patients with a C. spp. positive deep respiratory specimen, to investigate the impact of C. spp. on the occurrence of pneumonia, and to evaluate the outcomes of these pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively included all adult patients admitted to ICU in a 1000-bed University Hospital (2007-2017) who had a C. spp. positive lower respiratory tract specimen at a significant quantitative level. We used clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria to classify the likelihood of such pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 31 patients included, acute respiratory failure and postoperative care after major surgery were the main reasons of admission. SAPS II was 47 [34-60]. C. spp. pneumonia was considered as probable, possible and unlikely in 10, 14, and 7 patients, respectively. Fifty-two and 94% of C. spp. strains were sensitive to amoxicillin, and vancomycin/linezolid, respectively. Seventeen patients had a complete course of antibiotic against C. spp. The overall ICU mortality was 58%. CONCLUSION: Corynebacterium spp seems to be responsible for authentic pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. It should be considered as clinically relevant when predominantly present in respiratory specimen from patients suspected with pneumonia in ICU, and empirically treated."

Spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis occurs in rare cases of residual fibrosis with retractions and bullae. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient from a rural area in the province of Los Rios in Babahoyo, Ecuador, with no history of contact with tuberculosis. The patient arrived at the Emergency Department of the Regional Hospital of the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social (IESS), Babahoyo, due to acute respiratory failure, preceded by 10 days of evolution due to cough accompanied by greenish expectoration, chest pain, asthenia, and weight loss. On chest radiography, a left pneumothorax and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate were reported. A chest tube was placed, and the patient was intubated and was placed on invasive mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. Use of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF System detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis without resistance to rifampicin. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for the identification of bacillus acid-resistant alcohol was positive in alveolar bronchial lavage. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and phenotypic analysis showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia with carbapenemases resistance mechanism, and the KPC type enzyme was identified. The culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive from the fourth week. CONCLUSIONS Secondary pneumothorax due to rupture of the polymicrobial cavity and especially of tuberculous origin is a very special form of acute respiratory failure in patients with previous structural pulmonary lesions in the Emergency Department."

TB-associated BOF presents either as acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia or as a complication of surgical decompression of thoracic lymph nodes. METHODS: All children with TB- associated BOF were included. TB was diagnosed if MTB was cultured from respiratory secretions, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear was positive, GeneXpert MTB/RIF was positive or a chest radiograph revealed radiographic features typical of TB. BOF was diagnosed by a contrast swallow study and/or flexible bronchoscopy. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, if required. RESULTS: Total of 20 children were diagnosed with TB-associated BOF between 1999 and 2019, with a 75% survival. A total of 85% BOF involved the left main bronchus. A total of 80% of patients were MTB culture or ZN smear-positive. Chest X-ray abnormalities included: extensive parenchymal disease (80%) and lymph gland enlargement (45%). CT features included visualization of the BOF (60%), esophageal air (73%) and pneumomediastinum (40%). BOF closure was achieved by surgical closure (46%), spontaneous closure (26%), fibrin glue (13%), and esophageal stent (13%). Multivariant regression analysis showed that C- reactive protein (CRP), albumin and CRP/albumin ratio were associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Most TB-associated BOF are left-sided. It presents either acutely, with respiratory failure, or with chronic respiratory symptoms of aspiration. Children requiring invasive ventilation have high mortality. Most TB-associated BOF requires surgical intervention, although the use of fibrin glue offers an attractive alternative option."

However, the clinical significance of the positivity of Aspergillus precipitating antibody (APAb), a serodiagnostic test for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA), at the time of MAC-LD diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of APAb test results on the clinical outcomes of patients with MAC-LD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who were newly diagnosed as having MAC-LD between 2007 and 2014 in our hospital and checked for APAb at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: We enrolled 131 patients in this study. Of these patients, 20 (15.3%) tested positive for APAb at the diagnosis of MAC-LD. The APAb-positive patients were more frequently male (70.0% vs. 37.8%, P = 0.013) and more frequently had pulmonary emphysema (60.0% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001) and interstitial pneumonia (15.0% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.025) compared with the APAb-negative patients. During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, PA developed in 12 of the APAb-positive patients (60.0%, CPA: 9 and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: 3) and 12 APAb-negative patients (10.8%, CPA: 12) (P < 0.001). The APAb-positive patients had a significantly higher rate of mortality than did the APAb-negative patients (P = 0.004). A multivariate analysis indicated that older age, lower albumin, fibrocavitary or fibrocavitary and nodular/bronchiectatic radiographic features, and APAb positivity were negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: APAb-positive patients with MAC-LD more frequently develop PA and may have an unfavorable prognosis."

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CASE REPORT We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light microscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay, failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later. CONCLUSIONS The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coinfections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia, such as MBT, as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey, and tuberculosis is one of them. We must remain alert to any clinical subtleties so as to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and stay one step ahead of COVID-19."

We reviewed the clinical and pathologic data from 18 cases diagnosed using surgical specimens in our department during the last 10 years. Three clinicopathologic forms were observed: endobronchial infections complicating tuberculous sequelae or bronchiectases (n = 7), tumor-like lesions (n = 8), and diffuse pneumonia (n = 3). The two latter forms contrasted with the former by a male predominance, association with general debilitating conditions and inflammatory syndrome, and pathologically by smaller granules often located in parenchymal abscesses or excavations. The pathologic examination of the bacteria forming the granules permitted the diagnoses of actinomycosis (n = 10), botryomycosis (n = 7), or nocardiosis (n = 1). The latter case corresponded to an endobronchial infection. Both actinomycosis and botryomycosis were encountered in every clinicopathologic form. At present, pulmonary actinomycosis and related infections rarely seems to present with chest wall invasion. On the contrary, purely endobronchial forms represented a large proportion of our cases. Cultures are often difficult and the clinical appearance is not specific. However, pathologic examination with special stains must indicate the type of involved microorganism."

The clinical follow-up was characterized by recurrent hemoptysis resulting in marked anemia as well as by a continuous growth of the mycetoma. Suddenly a purulent gangrene of the whole upper lobe occurred infected by actinomyces israelii and staphylococcus but not aspergillus as it could be demonstrated in specimens from repeated transthoracic needle aspirations. After percutaneously inserted chest-tube drainage during 30 days the upper lobe cavity cleared up and the previously impressive aspergilloma had disappeared completely, however, the serum precipitins from aspergillus fumigatus still remained positive. After a course of several months without further pulmonary complications the patient finally died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. It is suggested, that the spontaneous lysis of the aspergilloma was due to a deprivation of it' nutritive basis by the infected pulmonary tissue. A similar mechanism may also account for a sometimes successful treatment of pulmonary aspergilloma after injection of an amphotericin containing paste as a novel therapeutic strategy which is recommended in the case of patient's inoperable conditions."

Brain computed tomography was normal on the day of admission but when repeated fifteen days later four lesions were seen with appearances suspicious of metastatic malignant disease. The isolation of Actinomyces odontolyticus in the bronchoalveolar lavage culture and the absence of evidence for neoplastic disease despite extensive investigation led to a diagnosis of disseminated actinomycosis with pulmonary and cerebral involvement. The patient's clinical condition improved with antibiotic therapy. The disseminated form of this infection as well as presentation with multifocal brain abscesses is rare.

The advantages of this method are avoiding the needs for internal fixation devices and for postoperative bracing. The literature on this is scant. Reported is a rare case of osteomyelitis of the D2 vertebra with an epidural abscess caused by Actinomyces israelii that spread from the lung and was treated by decompression and external fixation. METHODS: A 51-year-old man with right upper lobe pneumonia due to A. israelii coccobacillus developed osteomyelitis of the D2 vertebra and an epidural abscess with a gradual paraparesis. He underwent a laminectomy of D1-D3 and 3 weeks later stabilization of the upper thoracic spine using a tubular external fixator that was inserted from C7-D1 to D3-D4. The patient was treated with antibiotic intravenously and later orally. After 2 months, the external fixator was removed. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the patient had no fever, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level had normal values, and there was only a slight limitation in the range of motion of the cervical paraparesis. Radiography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stabilization of the affected segment without any sign of active osteomyelitis. There were no complications associated with the use of the external fixator. CONCLUSIONS: The use of external fixation offers an appropriate alternative for stabilization of the spine as a salvage procedure. The procedure could be performed easily and without any major complications. Especially for the treatment of complicated cases of spinal infection, the use of an external fixator can be of great benefit."

Both infections most commonly present as chronic, debilitating illnesses with radiographic manifestations simulating lung cancer or tuberculosis. Immunocompromised hosts, however, may develop fulminant disease resembling acute bacterial pneumonia. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of actinomycosis and nocardiosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment of actinomycosis is usually simple, requiring long-term, high-dose intravenous penicillin. Short-course chemotherapy, however, has recently been reported to be successful. Pulmonary nocardiosis is an important cause of opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed patients, and the incidence of this infection is increasing. The sulfonamides are still first-line agents in the management of nocardiosis, but resistance is most common among N. farcinica and N. otitidiscaviarum isolates. Carbapenems should be used as an alternative treatment for severely ill patients. Broth microdilution, E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and BACTEC (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA) radiometric method may be more useful in the routine clinical laboratory for antimicrobial testing of aerobic actinomycetes. SUMMARY: The practical distinction between the two diseases is in the matter of therapy. Diagnosis depends on a high degree of suspicion so as to alert the microbiology and pathology laboratories to employ special methods to identify the organisms. Early recognition and prompt treatment usually results in complete cure."

Most cases of empyema necessitatis are related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and, less commonly, to Actinomyces spp. and Streptococcus spp. Staphylococcus aureus has rarely been reported as the causative agent of empyema necessitatis, with the majority of S. aureus isolates being methicillin sensitive. Only two cases of empyema necessitatis due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have been reported in the medical literature. We report the case of a 59-year-old Caucasian male who presented to our institution with complaints of pain in and swelling of his left upper chest of 2-months duration. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed an 8.1- by 6.5-cm lesion which extended from the left upper lobe of the lung into the extrathoracic soft tissues beneath the left upper pectoralis muscle. A wedge resection of the left upper lung lobe revealed lung tissue with an organized pneumonia-like pattern associated with marked acute pleuritis. Blood and urine cultures and cultures of the left chest soft tissue mass grew MRSA. The patient was successfully treated with vancomycin followed by a 10-day outpatient course of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

The first case was a 45-year-old cachectic man with extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The lesions remained unclear for 18 months and only open lung biopsy with microscopic and cultural evaluation led to the diagnosis of actinomycosis. In the second case, classic cervico-facial actinomycosis in a 69-year-old farmer is described. Diagnosis was established on the basis of microscopic findings of ""sulphur granules"" eroding the mandible. Furthermore, the clinical presentation, with an indurated swelling of the jaw and intraoral fistula formation, was typical. The patient had a severe combined aortic valve lesion and died after ventricular fibrillation during hospitalization. Diagnosis could not be confirmed by culture, probably due to antibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis during tooth extraction on the first day of admission. Diagnostic difficulties and microbiologic aspects are discussed, with special focus on the rare species of Actinomyces meyeri which was cultured from biopsy specimens from the lung of the first patient.

We present a case report of pericardial actinomycosis and a review of 18 other cases reported in the literature since 1950. Possible risk factors include aspiration pneumonia, alcohol abuse, and periodontal disease. Actinomyces may cause purulent pericarditis that evolves into cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Clues to the identity of the causative organism (e.g., draining sinus tracts and the presence of sulfur granules) are frequently absent, and cultures often fail to yield the organism. Histologic examination of material obtained by biopsy is often necessary to make the diagnosis. Most cases originate from a thoracopulmonary site of actinomycosis and spread directly to the pericardium. Widespread dissemination to extrathoracic organs is uncommon. Treatment consists of high-dose, long-term antimicrobial therapy as well as drainage of the pericardial space."

Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare infectious disease, of bacterial aetiology, and of difficult diagnosis. This disease usually causes non-specific respiratory symptoms and radiological findings, and the treatment is based on the use of antibiotics. The authors describe a clinical case of a 53-year-old male smoker (50 pack years), initially seen for complaints of right-sided chest pain and sub-febrile temperature. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the inferior right lobe and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Empirical treatment with antibiotics caused partial and temporary improvement. Transthoracic biopsy revealed a pattern of organizing pneumonia with giant multinucleated cell granulomas. Repeat imaging studies revealed an enlargement of the pulmonary mass and therefore a right inferior lobectomy was performed. The pathologic study revealed a histological pattern of organizing pneumonia surrounding inflammatory bronchiectasis with a large number of Actinomyces colonies.

Tridimensional filamentous colonies of Actinomyces were observed in cytology. Antibiotic treatment resulted in an improvement of symptoms. The follow-up showed a decrease of the consolidation areas. Pulmonary actinomycosis is rare nowadays and clinical symptoms are unspecific and can be confused with a neoplasm process. Therefore, in patients with risk factors, symptoms of subacute pneumonia and radiologic findings of consolidation, it is advisable to consider pulmonary actinomycosis as a diagnostic possibility.

Actinomyces species are commensals of the human oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genitalia. Involvement of the thorax accounts for 15% to 20% of actinomycosis cases. Thoracic actinomycosis classically presents as an intrapulmonary infection of the alveoli, peribronchial tissue, and/or bronchioles. Endobronchial actinomycosis is a rare condition that has been reported in association with aspiration of a foreign body or broncholithiasis. A critical component in the pathogenesis is disruption of the mucosal barrier, thereby allowing invasion of the microorganisms from aspirated oropharyngeal secretions. Even with a high clinical suspicion, actinomycosis is a diagnostic challenge. The most common symptoms of endobronchial actinomycosis include cough, sputum production, and fever. The disease is often confused with lung cancer, tuberculosis, fungal infections, nocardiosis, and poorly responding pneumonia.

STATE OF THE ART: These infections share many similarities such as several differential diagnoses, difficulties to identify the pathogen, the importance of involving the microbiologist in the diagnostic investigation and the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment. However, major differences distinguish them: Nocardia and Rhodococcus infect mainly immunocompromised patients while actinomycosis also concerns immunocompetent patients; the severity of nocardioses is related to their hematogenous spread while locoregional extension by contiguity makes the gravity of actinomycosis. PROSPECTIVE: For these diseases, molecular diagnostic tools are essential, either to obtain a species identification and guide treatment in the case of nocardiosis or to confirm the diagnosis from a biological sample. Treatment of these infections is complex due to: (1) the limited data in the literature; (2) the need for prolonged treatment of several months; (3) the management of toxicities and drug interactions for the treatment of Nocardia and Rhodococcus. CONCLUSION: Close cooperation between pneumonologists, infectious disease specialists and microbiologists is essential for the management of these patients."

The symptom of actinomycosis is nonspecific and radiological images present as a slow-progressive mass lesion similarly to malignancies. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish pulmonary actinomycosis from malignancies. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old male who had esophageal cancer and a pulmonary mass that was positive for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography was initially diagnosed with esophageal cancer with a lung metastasis because he was asymptomatic. However, aspiration of pleural effusion revealed that the pulmonary lesion was actinomycosis. CONCLUSION: We present a case of pulmonary actinomycosis mimicking a lung metastasis from esophageal cancer. Diagnosis of asymptomatic pulmonary actinomycosis is difficult, and needle aspiration could be useful for a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis."

Lower airway infections are common among children with cerebral palsy (CP). Although harmless to healthy individuals, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause invasive infections, including CP, in immunocompromised hosts. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Actinomyces spp. have been reported as common causative organisms of EN. However, EN caused by P. aeruginosa has never been reported. We report the case of an 8-year-old girl with CP without tracheotomy who was admitted to our hospital with complaints of fever and increased epileptic seizures. First, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with antibiotics. However, seven days after admission, a palpable mobile mass overlying the lower part of the shoulder blade was noticed. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed broad high signal area on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images, indicating empyema of the left lower lung that had penetrated the pleural wall and spread to the subcutaneous area of the left back. Thus, she was diagnosed with EN. Twelve days after admission, P. aeruginosa was detected from the pus culture. Patients with CP who have chronic lung diseases, such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or empyema, may need careful follow up."

Endobronchial involvement of actinomycosis may be caused by aspiration of foreign bodies or broncholithiasis and may bronchoscopically masquerade as malignancy. A case of 68-year-old man is reported, who presented with productive cough and fever and had no response to antibiotic therapy with moxifloxacin. Patchy air-space consolidation on left lower lobe was demonstrated on CT and flexible bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial white necrotized mass, causing partial occlusion of bronchus and masquerading as lung cancer. Endobronchial actinomycosis was confirmed by biopsies of lesion, which revealed radiating filamentous colonies of Actinomyces and no evidence of malignancy. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous penicillin G for two weeks, followed by doxycycline per oral for six months, achieving full resolution of lesion on follow-up CT and bronchoscopy and no recurrence of symptoms."

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the right middle lobe, which got smaller on treatment with tosufloxacin for pneumonia. Unexpectedly, the tumour shadow remained one month later. Positron emission tomography depicted fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at the site. Although lung cancer was suspected, the mass was non-diagnostic on transbronchial and CT-guided biopsies. He was eventually diagnosed with PNLH on post-surgical histological analysis of the lung mass. Neutrophil accumulation and bacterial lumps were present, indicating Actinomyces infection in the pulmonary alveolus, suggesting that PNLH was associated with pneumonia.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 32 patients diagnosed with pulmonary actinomycosis between January 2013 and December 2019. General characteristics, clinical manifestations, lab data, chest CT imaging, treatment and follow-up information were reviewed and analyzed. Results: This study consisted of 19 males and 13 females, with a mean age of (58+-12) years, ranging from 16 to 76 years. There were 26 cases with co-morbidities. Among them, there were 16 cases with pulmonary co-morbidity. Sixteen cases had a smoking history. Eight cases, 5 men and 3 women, with a mean age of (48+-8) years, ranging from 41 to 58 years, received thoracic surgery for diagnosis. The remaining 24 cases who did not receive thoracic surgery consisted of 14 males and 8 females, with a mean age of (54+-14)years, ranging from 16 to 76 years. Cough (25cases), expectoration (21 cases) and fever (16 cases) were the common clinical manifestations. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ranged from 2 to 114 mm/1 h, with a mean value of (28+-31) mm/1 h. The ESR was elevated (>20 mm/1 h) in 15 cases. The C-reactive protein (CRP) ranged from 1 to 116 mg/L, with a mean value of (28+-45) mg/L. The CRP was elevated (>8 mg/L) in 16 cases. Localized air-space consolidation (18 cases), pulmonary mass or nodules (16 cases) were the common chest CT manifestations. When compared with non-surgical cases, fever was the sole characteristic that was less common in cases with thoracic surgery (1 case in surgical group vs 11 cases in non-surgical group, P<0.05). Actinomyces spp. was found in 7 cases (87.5%) who received thoracic surgery, in 16 (61.5%) specimens collected through bronchoscopy and in 10 (55.6%) sputum samples of good quality. All of our enrolled cases were administrated with oral antibiotics, and 14 cases were prescribed with intravenous antibiotics initially. Among them, 27 cases were administrated with more than one antibiotic. Penicillin, ampicillin and amoxillin were prescribed for 25 cases. Finally, 30 cases showed improvement or cure in our hospital. Conclusions: Pulmonary actinomycosis tended to develop in aged patients with co-morbidities. Cough, expectoration, fever and localized air-space consolidation were the common clinical and radiological manifestations, respectively. Actinomyces spp. could be found more easily in the surgically resected tissues than other specimens. The prognosis of our enrolled cases was good after treatment with combined antibiotics."

We suspected sternal osteomyelitis, and an incision and drainage were performed. Culture of the drainage fluid and bone tissue yielded A. israelii, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Streptococcus constellatus. Treatment with benzylpenicillin potassium (PCG) was administered. A subsequent chest CT scan showed that the peripheral nodule decreased in size after antimicrobial therapy. We therefore presumed the peripheral nodule as septic pulmonary embolism(SPE). Antimicrobial agents were administered for a total of 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of primary sternal osteomyelitis associated with presumed SPE caused by polymicrobial bacteria, including A. israelii.

It usually occurs due to inadequate treatment of a primary lung infection. Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative coccobacillus that is part of the normal oral flora. Infections due to this organism usually result from aspiration in conjunction with dental disease or trauma to the oral mucosa resulting in pneumonia or empyema. It often coinfects with Actinomyces and is known to cause empyema necessitans. Cases of monomicrobial empyema necessitans due to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in adults have rarely been reported with four such publications found on review of the literature. We present a patient with severe periodontitis who developed empyema necessitans due to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans likely from aspiration complicated by pyomyositis of the right triceps brachii and a left posterior thigh abscess.

Methods: The clinical data of a child with pulmonary actinomycosis who was hospitalized in Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in December 2019 was retrospectively analyzed. The related literature published from January 1975 to January 2020 was retrieved from Wanfang, CNKI and PubMed databases with ""pulmonary"" or ""thoracic"" and ""actinomycosis"" and ""pediatric"" or ""children"" or ""child"" as the keywords. And the characteristics of pediatric pulmonary actinomycosis were summarized based on the literature review. Results: The patient was a boy aged 12 years and 6 months. He was admitted due to cough and chest pain for more than 20 days, with fever on the first three days. The chest CT scan in local hospital found inflammatory lesions in the right middle lobe, which was also suspected to be cavitation. The flexible bronchoscopy showed congestion and edema of bronchial mucosa in the right middle lobe, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli DNA, although both purfied protein derivatives tuberculin test and T-spot were negative. During the hospitalization, the child had persistent cough and chest pain, but no fever. Pathogen metagene sequencing of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid detected Actinomyces (sequence number: 222) and Grevini Actinomycetes (sequence number: 185). The boy received intravenous cefoperazone sulbactam sodium for 2 weeks followed by oral amoxicillin clavulanate potassium for 6 weeks. Until April 2020, his clinical symptoms completely relieved, and the pulmonary lesions were significantly absorbed on the latest chest CT scan. Eight articles and 62 children with pulmonary actinomycosis were reported, but no related reports were retrieved from CNKI and Wanfang databases. The youngest case was 27 months old. The clinical presentations of this disease were nonspecific. The main symptoms included chest wall masses (8 cases), cough (23 cases), pain (chest, back, shoulders and armpits) (24 cases), fever (25 cases), weight loss (26 cases), etc. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations and imaging features of pediatric pulmonary actinomycosis are nonspecific, therefore it could easily be misdiagnosed. For children with pneumonia of unknown etiology and failing to respond to routine antibiotics, the pathogen metagene sequencing of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be helpful for diagnosis. With appropriate course of antibiotic treatment, the prognosis is good in most cases."

However, due to the complexity in identifying them for most clinical laboratories, there is scant knowledge about their real clinical significance. In this work, 166 isolates of 13 different species of Actinomyces/Actinotignum species recovered from clinical samples of patients treated in a university hospital were studied. The identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification. MALDI-TOF MS identified 91.57% of the isolates (152/166) at the species level using a score >= 1.7 and 3.61% (6/166) of the isolates were identified only at the gender level with a score >= 1.5. MALDI-TOF MS did not yield reliable identification results for 4.82% (8/166) of the isolates. Actinomyces/Actinotignum species were isolated from: soft tissue (n: 47), urine samples (n: 35), head / neck abscesses (n: 19), genital abscesses (n: 11), blood samples (n: 10), breast abscesses (n: 8), osteoarticular samples (n: 6), abdominal/ascitic fluids (n: 3), abdominal abscesses (n: 5), sputum/BAL (n: 4), brain abscesses (n: 3), and others (n: 15).

The advantages of this method are avoiding the needs for internal fixation devices and for postoperative bracing. The literature on this is scant. Reported is a rare case of osteomyelitis of the D2 vertebra with an epidural abscess caused by Actinomyces israelii that spread from the lung and was treated by decompression and external fixation. METHODS: A 51-year-old man with right upper lobe pneumonia due to A. israelii coccobacillus developed osteomyelitis of the D2 vertebra and an epidural abscess with a gradual paraparesis. He underwent a laminectomy of D1-D3 and 3 weeks later stabilization of the upper thoracic spine using a tubular external fixator that was inserted from C7-D1 to D3-D4. The patient was treated with antibiotic intravenously and later orally. After 2 months, the external fixator was removed. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the patient had no fever, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level had normal values, and there was only a slight limitation in the range of motion of the cervical paraparesis. Radiography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stabilization of the affected segment without any sign of active osteomyelitis. There were no complications associated with the use of the external fixator. CONCLUSIONS: The use of external fixation offers an appropriate alternative for stabilization of the spine as a salvage procedure. The procedure could be performed easily and without any major complications. Especially for the treatment of complicated cases of spinal infection, the use of an external fixator can be of great benefit."

Infections are rare, slowly progressing and most commonly affect the cervicofacial region. Actinomyces israelii is the most frequently isolated species but a number of other species may cause infection. We report the first postnatally acquired case of an actinomycosis caused by A. neuii in a child. We also provide a systematic review of all published cases of A. neuii infections. In children, there is one case report of a premature infant with perinatally acquired A. neuii sepsis. In adults 21 cases have currently been reported and A. neuii infection was associated with endophthalmitis after eye surgery, foreign material-associated infection and abscess formation in the inguinal, axillary, and mammary area. Our case highlights that a A. neuii infection is also a potential differential diagnosis in children with chronic lymphadenitis. "

Males are affected three times more than females; the incidence of the disease is higher in adults than in children. The main causative agent is Actinomyces israelii, which can be found in the oropharynx of healthy persons. Therefore actinomycosis represents always an endogenous infection, often in connection with other bacteriae. The thoracic manifestation amounts to approximately 15 percent of all cases. The main clinical symptoms are pain, fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss. The blood picture shows an increased number of white blood cells with a left shift in the differential white blood cell count. Furthermore, there is a strongly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Radiographs demonstrate no typical patterns of pulmonary abnormalities. For the diagnosis there is a need of anaerobic cultures, in second line histological examination of tissue specimens. Differential diagnosis of actinomycosis includes chronic pneumonias caused by other rare germs and neoplasms. After early onset antibiotic long term treatment a good prognosis may be expected. Penicillin represents the antibiotic of first choice."

The clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics of pulmonary actinomycosis lack specificity and can lead to confusion with tuberculosis and lung cancer. The present study reported a case of pulmonary actinomycosis diagnosed by transbronchoscopic lung biopsy and reviewed the literature on the disease. The clinical characteristics, signs, laboratory findings as well as progression, diagnosis and treatment in the case of pulmonary actinomycosis were analyzed. The patient was diagnosed by transbronchoscopic lung biopsy. After two weeks of antibiotic therapy, the cough was significantly improved and the patient's temperature returned to normal. Moreover, the lesion in the left lower lung was significantly smaller. Pulmonary actinomycosis is usually confused for tuberculosis and lung cancer. The present findings indicated that transbronchoscopic lung biopsy is a useful tool for diagnosing the disease.

His history was unremarkable except for chronic gastritis and an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 10 years earlier. Following persistent hemoptysis, elevated inflammatory markers, and a non-revealing bronchoscopy, a computed tomography scan of the thorax and upper abdomen revealed a tumor in the upper part of the left kidney spreading directly to the adjacent diaphragm and left lower lobe.

A. species predominantly A. meyeri and A. israelii represent the second most common pathogen for empyema necessitans after mycobacteria. The incidence is reported in the literature to be 1:300,000. Men are thrice more likely to be affected than women. Pathogenetically, an infection can be triggered by aspiration in immunocompromised individuals which leads to an atelectasis with pneumonitis. In two cases, a 38-year-old construction worker and a 61-year-old woman with ulcerative breast carcinoma, who presented to the local emergency department with a painful swelling of the left chest, diagnostic workup revealed a pleural empyema necessitatis of the left chest. An antibiotic treatment was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam and sulbactam/ampicillin, respectively. Temporally vacuum-dressing therapy was initiated after surgical debridement. In the course of the procedure, a reconstruction of tissue damage was feasible. The patients were recovered completely and discharged with an oral antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin) for 6 and 12 months, respectively. Thoracic actinomycosis is a relatively uncommon and traditionally chronic, indolent infection secondary to pulmonary infection with A. species . Surgical treatment is generally reserved for cases failing to resolve with antibiotic therapy. Early diagnosis, prompt debridement, and narrow spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics can result in complete resolution of infection and good prognosis."

In the medical literature, there are only a few reported cases of brain abscess caused by Actinomyces meyeri. In this report, we present a 35-year-old male patient who experienced an insidious headache and left-sided weakness and was diagnosed with an Actinomyces meyeri brain abscess. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Nepalese man came to our institute with the primary complaint of insidious onset of headache and left-sided weakness. His physical examination was remarkable for the left-sided weakness with power 2/5 on both upper and lower limbs, hypertonia, hyperreflexia and positive Babinski sign, with intact sensory function. Cardiac examination revealed systolic murmur with regular S1 and S2, and lung examination was normal. The patient had poor dental hygiene. Biochemistry and haematology panel were normal. Urinalysis, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram revealed no abnormality. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mitral regurgitation. However, there was no evidence of valvular vegetation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, which showed a bi-lobed rim enhancing lesion with a conglomeration of two adjoining round lesions in the right parietal parasagittal region. Perilesional oedema resulting in mass effect over the right lateral ventricle and mid-right uncal herniation with midline shift was noted. Craniotomy was performed, and the lesion was excised. Gram staining of the extracted sample revealed gram variable filamentous rods. Creamy white, moist, confluent colonies were observed after performing anaerobic culture in chocolate agar. On the gram staining, they showed gram-positive filamentous rods. Actinomyces meyeri was identified based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) technology. Based on the susceptibilities, he was successfully treated with ampicillin-sulbactam. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Actinomyces should be considered in the differential diagnosis of brain abscess in patients with poor dental hygiene, and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to better results."

Cure was achieved with surgical debridement and administration of intravenous penicillin, followed by oral penicillin, for 1 year. A concomitant gram-negative bacillus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was also isolated. Review of the literature revealed only 26 well-documented cases of infection with A. meyeri. Male adults are mainly affected, and alcoholism is frequently the underlying condition in these patients. Associated bacteria were isolated in two-thirds of these cases. In contrast to other species of Actinomyces, A. meyeri often causes pulmonary infection and shows a tendency for hematogenous dissemination.

CASE REPORT: A fifty-two year old man, who was both a heavy smoker and an alcoholic, was admitted to hospital with confusion associated with a pseudo-tumoral right upper lobe pneumonia. Brain computed tomography was normal on the day of admission but when repeated fifteen days later four lesions were seen with appearances suspicious of metastatic malignant disease. The isolation of Actinomyces odontolyticus in the bronchoalveolar lavage culture and the absence of evidence for neoplastic disease despite extensive investigation led to a diagnosis of disseminated actinomycosis with pulmonary and cerebral involvement. The patient's clinical condition improved with antibiotic therapy. The disseminated form of this infection as well as presentation with multifocal brain abscesses is rare. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of actinomycosis is problematic because it is an uncommon infection and microbiological identification is often difficult and delayed. It should be considered when clinical presentation suggests malignant disease but there is no histological confirmation."

We report a case of bimicrobial bloodstream infection with Actinomyces odontolyticus and Escherichia coli in an intravenous drug user. A 36-year-old, male intravenous drug user was admitted with acute-onset pleuritic chest pain, back pain, pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypotension. Chest CT showed multiple, bilateral, cavitating lung lesions, most likely the result of septic emboli originating from an infected deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Blood cultures led to a mixed growth of A. odontolyticus, identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), and E. coli. The rising tide of bloodstream infections with Actinomyces species is likely to continue with the increasing availability of sophisticated molecular identification techniques, including MALDI-TOF. In this case, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were particularly important because the E. coli was susceptible to ciprofloxacin, whereas the A. odontolyticus was resistant. "

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old male patient visited the emergency room with a complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath, and he developed acute respiratory failure rapidly. DIAGNOSIS: An abscess in the left lower lung field was diagnosed on the computed tomography scan of chest. INTERVENTIONS: Immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics was initiated along with a pigtail catheter insertion for pus drainage. OUTCOMES: A odontolyticus was cultured on the drained pus and P micra was identified by a blood culture. The patient was successfully weaned from the mechanical ventilator and the lung abscess was completely resolved.

A 60-year-old man with a hoarse voice was referred to our hospital. Lung squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed at the clinical tumor-node-metastasis stage of cT2N2M0, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy was initiated. Further, a small cavity was also detected in the left upper lobe, but it was observed. During chemoradiotherapy, the small cavity lesion rapidly increased accompanying infiltration, and administration of short-term antibiotics did not improve the patient's condition. Bronchoscopy did not show any diagnostic results. Although a rapidly progressive malignant lesion could not be excluded and surgical management was considered, resection could not be performed because of the tight adhesion of the mass. Therefore, bronchoscopy was performed again, and the bronchial lavage culture showed a positive smear for the Actinomyces species. Further, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), the bacteria was identified as A. odontolyticus. After long-term administration of amoxicillin, the lung cavity with infiltration gradually improved. To the best of our knowledge, there have been nine cases of pulmonary A. odontolyticus (excluding those with only empyema or pleural mass without lung lesions), which can occur in immunocompetent patients with persistent lung shadow. None of the cases showed drastic deterioration; therefore, the present case is the first to highlight that A. odontolyticus possibly produce drastically progressive lung cavity lesion. Further, repeated bronchoscopy and MALDI-TOF MS could help to diagnose pulmonary actinomycosis."

Only 3.4% of the blood cultures were classified as true bacteraemia and the rest as contaminants. The commonest type of isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (49%), which were considered contaminants in all cases. Other contaminants represented 13.2% of all the positive blood cultures. The following bacteria comprised the group of true bacteraemia: Escherichia coli (12.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.8%), viridans streptococci (7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (2.8%), Moraxella species (1.4%) and Flavobacterium species (1.4%). Blood cultures were positive in 3.6% of patients with pneumonia and in 10% of patients with urinary tract infections. In patients with fever of unclear source blood cultures were positive in 3.1% of children between 0-36 months of age and in 1.1% of patients older than 16 years. As a whole, patients with positive blood cultures were clinically sicker, a higher percentage of them required admission to the hospital and had higher temperatures or rapidly fatal disease, compared with the group of patients with negative blood cultures. In order to improve the yield of blood cultures in febrile patients, first, better a priori identification of those subjects at high risk for bacteraemia will reduce the number of unnecessary blood cultures and second, sterile venipuncture techniques should be improved in order to reduce the number of contaminants."

We studied 443 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization to define the role of cytomegalovirus in this illness. Four patients (0.9%) had good evidence that cytomegalovirus caused their pneumonia: 2 had the virus isolated from pulmonary tissue and 2 had cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies visualized in this tissue. An additional 14 patients had serologic evidence (a fourfold rise in the complement fixation tests) of cytomegalovirus infection. Analysis of these 18 patients suggest, that cytomegalovirus plays a role in community-acquired pneumonia. Six (33%) of the patients were immunosuppressed. Six others had concomitant infections: Chlamydia trachomatis (3); Epstein-Barr virus and M. pneumoniae (1); and bacteremia with Group B streptococcus and Bacteroides fragilis plus Eubacterium lentum (1 each).

We found that the prevalence of complement fixing antibody to cytomegalovirus increased with age. Such antibody was lacking among those in the 16-20 year group while it peaked at 65% for males and at 78% for females ages 91-100 years. Despite the fact that 42.2% of the adults lacked antibody to cytomegalovirus, community-acquired pneumonia due to this virus is uncommon and does not justify routine serological testing for such infection among patients with community-acquired pneumonia."

Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms. He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission. He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography. The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml. Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia. Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative. The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis. After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL. Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%. The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure. This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis. The mechanism of cardiac pathology caused by COVID-19 needs further study."

","SPECIES:BacteroidesID:3290185TITLE:Microbiological and clinical aspects of aspiration pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Aspiration pneumonia is characterized by a pneumonitis in a dependent segment of the lung with typical necrosis or abscess-formation in the parenchyma. Observed aspiration or predisposition to aspiration, cavitation or abscess formation, with or without empyema fluid and isolation of distinctive micro-organisms are important clues to the diagnosis. Diagnostic procedures to collect anaerobic uncontaminated secretions are transtracheal aspiration, blood cultures, pleural fluid aspiration, fibreoptic bronchoscopic protected investigations and percutaneous transthoracic aspiration. Leading pathogens in more than 90% are anaerobic bacteria, mostly species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus; aerobic bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, mainly Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment depends on bacteriological results; penicillin G and clindamycin are the most useful antibiotics against anaerobes and should be administered over a long period of time (4-12 weeks), adjusted to the clinical course of the individual patient."

In 19 patients we found the bronchial secretions steril (particularly carcinomas). Eight patients showed anaerobic gramnegative rods (Bacteroides and Fusobacteria) as predominant germs. Also in eight patients we found a mixed culture consisting in several anaerobic gram-negative rods, anaerobic gram-positive sporeless rods, anaerobic cocci, partly Clostridia and aerobes (carcinomas, pneumonias). A contamination can be excluded. In a series of patients anaerobes must be considered as infectious agent, in abscessed pneumonias particularly Bacteroides and Fusobacteria. Repeatedly an impressive clinical improvement has been established under the treatment by Metronidazol. The evidence of anaerobes especially succeeded in cases with copious mucopurulent or pure purulent secretions. The accumulation of anaerobes in bronchial secretions in alcoholics is evident."

","SPECIES:BacteroidesID:37594TITLE:Anaerobic pulmonary infections.ABSTRACT:The main cause of anaerobic pulmonary infections is aspiration of saliva, upper airway secretions or gastric content. Predisposing conditions include prominent dental disease, chronic upper respiratory tract infections and reduced consciousness. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci are the most frequently encountered organisms. The clinical presentations are lung abscess, lung gangrene and empyema, which all tend to take a slow and indolent course. Preferred localization are dependent lung segments, most often on the right side. For bacteriological examination in these infections, only transtracheal aspirate and aspirate from the lung or pleural space are considered adequate. In 26 cases of empyema treated in our hospital during the last 3 years, adequate specimens had been taken in 19. Fifteen had been adequately examined, and anaerobes were cultured in 6. Among 29 abscesses treated during the same period, adequate specimens had been taken in only 14, and 11 had been properly examined. Seven specimens grew anaerobes on culture. In prospective studies of transtracheal aspirate in 15 chronic bronchitics without emphysema, anaerobes were not demonstrated. In 11 patients with bronchiectasis, anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 3. Finally, no anaerobic bacteria could be demonstrated in the transtracheal aspirate from 76 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Anaerobic, pulmonary infections do not represent an intriguing medical problem in our region. However, knowledge of these infections is necessary to secure adequacy in collection of specimens and in their bacteriological examination."

Cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. The most frequent aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis. Replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. Tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia.

Overall, the success rate was 83% and drug-related adverse effects were minimal. The drug was less efficacious in infections caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens than it was in those caused by gram-negative pathogens. The following gram-positive organisms were associated with special problems during moxalactam therapy: Streptococcus pneumoniae (development of meningitis and a relapse of pneumonia with a more resistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (in vivo emergence of moxalactam resistance, and the enterococci (failure of therapy and a fatal superinfection. Moxalactam performed well in infections caused by most gram-negative organisms, including aminoglycoside-resistant strains, but the previously reported emergence of gram-negative bacillary resistance to moxalactam during therapy was reconfirmed in our series with Serratia marcescens. The use of moxalactam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis was further supported by a patient with meningitis-ventriculitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis who was cured with moxalactam after failure on chloramphenicol."

Indications for ceftazidime encompassed a broad spectrum of diseases: 10 complicated UTI, 13 skeletal and soft tissue infections, 4 bronchopulmonary infections, 6 intra-abdominal infections, 3 septicaemias, 1 brain abscess with meningitis. Ceftazidime was administered without other antimicrobials, except for metronidazole in two patients with intra-abdominal abscesses. Doses varied from 2 to 12 g/day (median: 3 g), given for 3-31 days (median: 12 days). Clinical cure was recorded in 26 patients (81%), 24 (75%) having also a bacteriological cure. In six patients, clinical findings subsided significantly but with incomplete resolution or relapse during follow-up. Four organisms developed resistance during therapy: 2 Pseudomonas, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Bacteroides vulgatus. Three patients developed mild superinfections (2 Candida, 1 Staph. epidermidis). Ceftazidime was well tolerated; adverse events were mild and reversible. Local thrombophlebitis was observed twice, two patients had a positive reaction to the direct Coombs' test, two had transitory elevation of transaminases and one suffered from drowsiness during intravenous injections.

The materials were obtained by percutaneous aspiration of lung and heart immediately after death or directly from lung and heart after opening the thorax at autopsy. Anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed for isolation. Twenty-one strains of anaerobic bacteria were recovered (3.4% of the 603 total isolates) from the lungs for 368 cases, and 16 strains (6.5%) of anaerobic bacteria were isolated among 247 strains from heart blood for 314 cases. Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently isolated anaerobe from both the lungs and heart blood. The same bacterium was isolated from both the lungs and heart blood of four autopsied patients; from three of these patients only B. fragilis was isolated. Enteric gram-negative bacilli and Pseudomonas were common in the patients with nosocomial pneumonia; these patients usually had received many antibiotics before death. The results indicate that anaerobes are not common in fatal nosocomial or other types of pneumonia in the hospital setting, but B. fragilis is relatively important among the anaerobes isolated.

In the present study. 74 institutionalized children with aspiration pneumonia were studied by percutaneous transtracheal aspiration. Their average age was 8 years. Fifty-two patients had pneumonitis, 12, necrotizing pneumonia, and 10, lung abscess. Only one patient (with lung abscess) had a complicating empyema. There was an average of five bacteria isolated per specimen--2.8 anaerobes and 2.2 nonanaerobes. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and fuso-bacteria; there were ten patients who yielded members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. The predominant nonanaerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, aspiration pneumonia in children, as in adults, commonly involves anaerobic bacteria. When aspiration occurs in a medical institution, nosocomial pathogens which are aerobic or facultative will also often be involved, in both children and adults."

Simple pneumonitis resolves promptly with antibiotic therapy. If treatment is delayed, simple pneumonitis may evolve into a more fulminant process of necrotizing pneumonia with a significant mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Lung abscess, typically a subacute or chronic infection, responds well to antibiotic therapy so long as the cavity is drained via the communicating bronchus.

In this debilitated population, gram-negative bacillary pneumonias (GNBP) are increasingly common. GNBP account for two of every three pneumonia deaths today. As a group, the mortality of GNBP is about 50%. Although the original epidemiologic surveys were done 15 years ago, there is little evidence for an improving case fatality rate despite the appearance of aminoglycoside antibiotics, carbenicillin, and cephalosporins. In susceptible patients, GNBP pneumonias occur both in the community and as nosocomial infections. Recognition of the dangers of contaminated reservoir nebulizers or other similar devices used in inhalation therapy has led to epidemiologic measures within hospitals that have markedly decreased the incidence of this nosocomial GNBP. The role of Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum and similar examinations of specimens obtained by transtracheal aspiration, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and lung biopsy in the diagnosis of GNBP are discussed in this review (see Criteria for Diagnosis). In the presence of pulmonary emphysema, congestive heart failure, mixed gram-negative bacillary infections, or the use of immunosuppressive drugs, typical characteristics of individual GNBP may not be apparent. Typical features of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Proteus, Hemophilus, and anaerobic pulmonary infections are described. Early recognition and institution of appropriate antibacterial agents are emphasized, particularly in GNBP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Friedlander's bacillus, where the mortality approaches 70%. The mortality of GNBP, including Enterobacter, Proteus, Hemophilus, and anaerobic GNBP, is about 20%. The latter figure is the same as the mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia in similar patients."

","SPECIES:BacteroidesID:8324127TITLE:Anaerobic bacterial infections of the lung and pleural space.ABSTRACT:In 193 reviewed cases of pleuropulmonary infections involving anaerobic bacteria, the predominant clinical syndromes were aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema. Most patients had an indolent infection with tissue necrosis (abscess or bronchopulmonary fistula) at initial presentation. Nevertheless, many had a more fulminant disease course resembling that of pneumococcal pneumonia. Transtracheal aspiration was the procedure most commonly used to obtain uncontaminated specimens for anaerobic culture; since this procedure now is seldom employed, pulmonary infections due to anaerobes rarely have an etiologic diagnosis at present. The dominant pathogens are Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium species. Although clindamycin is widely considered to be the antibiotic of choice, proper therapeutic trials would probably prove many antibiotics to be effective for the treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections."

The results of 730 blood cultures taken from 718 patients were retrospectively analysed. The total percentage of positive cultures was 9.7%. Only 3.4% of the blood cultures were classified as true bacteraemia and the rest as contaminants. The commonest type of isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (49%), which were considered contaminants in all cases. Other contaminants represented 13.2% of all the positive blood cultures. The following bacteria comprised the group of true bacteraemia: Escherichia coli (12.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.8%), viridans streptococci (7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (2.8%), Moraxella species (1.4%) and Flavobacterium species (1.4%). Blood cultures were positive in 3.6% of patients with pneumonia and in 10% of patients with urinary tract infections. In patients with fever of unclear source blood cultures were positive in 3.1% of children between 0-36 months of age and in 1.1% of patients older than 16 years. As a whole, patients with positive blood cultures were clinically sicker, a higher percentage of them required admission to the hospital and had higher temperatures or rapidly fatal disease, compared with the group of patients with negative blood cultures. In order to improve the yield of blood cultures in febrile patients, first, better a priori identification of those subjects at high risk for bacteraemia will reduce the number of unnecessary blood cultures and second, sterile venipuncture techniques should be improved in order to reduce the number of contaminants."

The gastric pH of over 5.00 was seen in 10 cases. Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 20 cases (95%). Aerobic bacterial counts per ml of gastric aspirates correlated positively with the pH of those aspirates but was little correlation between the pH of the gastric aspirates and the number of anaerobic bacteria of the samples, which were positive in 7 cases (33%). Candida and Staphylococcus were predominant isolates with positive rates of 82% and 41%, respectively. While Fusobacterium was isolated from 33% of the samples, none of the Bacteroides fragilis group organisms were isolated. It was also observed in the control group that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the gastric aspirates with high pH. These results suggest that in patients receiving H2-blocker anaerobes as well as aerobes may have the possibility to become pathogen for aspirate pneumonia and so on because of the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the gastric fluid."

Sporadic case reports of cytomegalovirus community-acquired pneumonia have appeared. We studied 443 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization to define the role of cytomegalovirus in this illness. Four patients (0.9%) had good evidence that cytomegalovirus caused their pneumonia: 2 had the virus isolated from pulmonary tissue and 2 had cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies visualized in this tissue. An additional 14 patients had serologic evidence (a fourfold rise in the complement fixation tests) of cytomegalovirus infection. Analysis of these 18 patients suggest, that cytomegalovirus plays a role in community-acquired pneumonia. Six (33%) of the patients were immunosuppressed. Six others had concomitant infections: Chlamydia trachomatis (3); Epstein-Barr virus and M. pneumoniae (1); and bacteremia with Group B streptococcus and Bacteroides fragilis plus Eubacterium lentum (1 each). Seven patients (39%) required assisted ventilation, four of whom developed secondary bacterial pneumonia. Five (28%) died. Only two patients had a clinical and radiographic picture suggestive of a viral illness as a cause of the pneumonia. Three patients had atypical lymphocytes in their peripheral blood film. We found that the prevalence of complement fixing antibody to cytomegalovirus increased with age. Such antibody was lacking among those in the 16-20 year group while it peaked at 65% for males and at 78% for females ages 91-100 years. Despite the fact that 42.2% of the adults lacked antibody to cytomegalovirus, community-acquired pneumonia due to this virus is uncommon and does not justify routine serological testing for such infection among patients with community-acquired pneumonia."

Therefore, the major causative organisms are oral or gastric bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the anaerobic bacteria which can cause aspiration pneumonia, Fusobacterium spp., Finegoldia magna, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Streptococcus milleri group to ceftriaxone, cefmetazole, flomoxef, ampicillin/sulbactam, and ampicillin. We also tested the beta-lactamase activities of each of the bacterial strains. Fusobacterium spp. and Finegoldia magna were susceptible to all of the tested antimicrobial drugs, except ampicillin, and showed no beta-lactamase activity. The Streptococcus milleri group, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. showed decreased susceptibility to cefmetazole or flomoxef as compared to the susceptibility levels documented in a previous report. There was one strain of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius which was not susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam, but also showed no beta-lactamase activity, suggesting that this strain harbored a mechanism of resistance other than the production of beta-lactamase. The susceptibility of Prevotella spp. to ceftriaxone was also decreased as compared to the susceptibility level documented in a previous report. Furthermore, beta-lactamase-positive strains were found even among ceftriaxone-susceptible strains. Elderly persons with swallowing dysfunction carry a risk of recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia and repeated use of antibiotics increases the risk of development of antibiotic resistance. In the present study, the antibiotic susceptibilities of some of organisms which can cause aspiration pneumonia were found to be decreased as compared to the susceptibility levels documented in a previous report. Therefore, surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these bacteria is recommended to prevent the development of resistance."

Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections.

The rational choice of therapy mainly rests upon the knowledge of the microbiological epidemiology of LRTI, and on the possible host-parasite relationship. In community-acquired pneumonia, there is general concensus that penicillin maintains its position as the first drug of choice, and that therapy can be changed to erythromycin or tetracycline in cases of therapeutic failure. Treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, and LRTI in immunocompromised patients, calls for antibiotics with a broader antimicrobial spectrum. Clindamycin has an antimicrobial spectrum which makes this antibiotic a possible alternative in community-acquired pneumonia, and its efficacy in pneumococcal pneumonia has been documented. However, as first choice therapy it should be reserved for cases of penicillin allergy, or cases of strongly suspected staphylococcal pneumonia. In aspiration pneumonia--nearly always caused by anaerobic bacteria--penicillin has long been the preferred therapy, even in cases with Bacteroides fragilis. However, recent publications have clearly documented that in primary lung abscess, clindamycin is superior to penicillin. These results are especially important since metronidazole has been shown to be less effective in such cases."

The materials were obtained by percutaneous aspiration of lung and heart immediately after death or directly from lung and heart after opening the thorax at autopsy. Anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed for isolation. Twenty-one strains of anaerobic bacteria were recovered (3.4% of the 603 total isolates) from the lungs for 368 cases, and 16 strains (6.5%) of anaerobic bacteria were isolated among 247 strains from heart blood for 314 cases. Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently isolated anaerobe from both the lungs and heart blood. The same bacterium was isolated from both the lungs and heart blood of four autopsied patients; from three of these patients only B. fragilis was isolated. Enteric gram-negative bacilli and Pseudomonas were common in the patients with nosocomial pneumonia; these patients usually had received many antibiotics before death. The results indicate that anaerobes are not common in fatal nosocomial or other types of pneumonia in the hospital setting, but B. fragilis is relatively important among the anaerobes isolated.

The physicians of various specialties should be familiar with the symptoms of botulism because its sings concern the nervous system, the organ of sight and the gastrointestinal system. In older persons with coexisting chronic diseases some symptoms of botulism may be not distinctive or may mimic exacerbation of early existing diseases. The handbook descriptions present the food borne botulism as dramatic and often deadly disease. However in some cases this disease can have mild course and poor symptomatology. Two cases of food borne botulism with different clinical course are presented in this paper, when the correct diagnosis was established with delay. A 78-year-old man was admitted with the symptoms of pneumonia and dizziness of uncertain aetiology. The diagnosis of food borne botulism was established in 10th day of hospital stay, when the most symptoms were not present. Despite of such late diagnosis and relatively good patient's condition a therapy with antitoxin was administrated. The second case reports a 70-year-old man with chronic heart failure, diabetes and obesity, when the delay of correct diagnosis was about of 24 hours. Despite of relatively early antitoxin administration and intensive supportive care patient died in 11th day of hospital stay."

Testing for the presence of botulinum F toxin was made using multiplex PCR. Bioassay for a large number of colonies was performed in mice to evaluate the production of any lethal toxin, but the results were negative. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, there are no cases of C. baratii infection reported in Brazil and we highlight the importance of anaerobic lab tests in the standard routine of diagnosis."

Methods: Clinical data of 3 infants with type B botulism who were admitted to Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics from May to November 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Botulinum toxin was detected in fecal samples or fecal enrichment solution of the patients, and Clostridium botulinum was cultured and isolated from fecal samples. Results: The age of onset of the patients (two boys and one girl) was 3, 3 and 8 months old, respectively. Two cases had the onset in May and one case had the onset in November. There were two cases with mixed feeding and one case with breast feeding. One case's family members engaged in meat processing. All of them were previously healthy. All the children presented with acute flaccid paralysis, cranial nerve involvement and difficult defecation. Two cases had secondary urinary tract infection. Electromyograms of two cases showed that action potential amplitude of the motor nerve were lower than those of their peers. After treatments including intravenous human immunoglobulin, respiratory tract management, urethral catheterization, nasal feeding, etc., three cases recovered completely 2 to 4 months later. Type B botulinum toxin was detected in the fecal diluent of one patient, and the TPGYT enrichment solution and cooked meet medium of the feces of 3 patients, respectively. Clostridium botulinum B was identified from the feces of 3 infants after culture, isolation and purification. Conclusions: Combined with typical clinical manifestations including acute flaccid paralysis, cranial nerve involvement symptoms and difficult defecation examination, infant botulism can be clinically diagnosed. The detection of fecal botulinum toxin and the culture and isolation of Clostridium botulinum are helpful for the diagnosis."

Forty-three were caused by Clostridium botulinum type B. Progressive weakness necessitated ventilatory support in 39 infants. Complications during hospitalization included otitis media in 13 patients and aspiration pneumonia in 11. Eight infants developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and two developed adult respiratory distress syndrome. One infant died of progressive bradycardia despite adequate control of ventilation. Manifestations of autonomic nervous system dysfunction recognized on admission to the hospital were constipation, distention of the urinary bladder, and decreased salivation and tearing. During hospitalization, some infants had unexpected fluctuations of skin color, blood pressure, and heart rate. Infants' strength improved despite persistent intestinal elaboration of toxin. C botulinum was isolated from seven of nine home or work environments sampled. All 44 infants were white and were receiving breast milk at the time of onset of symptoms. The majority had first feedings of nonhuman food substances within 4 weeks prior to onset of symptoms. Delineation of fecal flora in seven infants revealed predominance of enterobacteriaceae. Perturbations of intestinal flora during infancy, especially at weaning, may cause transient permissiveness to colonization by C botulinum."

Both the organism and the toxin were type B. The onset of illness was characterized by mild constipation, apathy, weak sucking and difficulty with swallowing. Incipient, probably aspiration, pneumonia was diagnosed at the same time. Further signs of botulism developed during hospitalization, viz. loss of head control, pooled oral secretion, weak cry, mild ptosis, reduced facial expression, generalized muscular weakness and reduced spontaneous activity. A nasogastric feeding tube was needed because the ability to suck and swallow was impaired. Immediately on admission of the infant to hospital emergency treatment was started with ampicillin, which was followed by penicillin injections. The infant recovered in 60 days. Subsequent medical examinations demonstrated that the recovery was complete and the development normal. The case represents the first instance of infant botulism detected on the European Continent."

Our objective was to consider the impact of pneumonia and influenza timing and severity on CDI incidence. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the US National Hospital Discharge Survey sample. Hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of CDI or pneumonia and influenza between 1993 and 2008 were identified from the National Hospital Discharge Survey data set. Poisson regression models of monthly CDI incidence were used to measure 1) the time lag between the annual pneumonia and influenza prevalence peak and the annual CDI incidence peak and 2) the lagged effect of pneumonia and influenza prevalence on CDI incidence. CDI was identified in 18,465 discharges (8.52 per 1,000 discharges). Peak pneumonia prevalence preceded peak CDI incidence by 9.14 weeks (95% confidence interval: 4.61, 13.67). A 1% increase in pneumonia prevalence was associated with a cumulative effect of 11.3% over a 6-month lag period (relative risk = 1.113, 95% confidence interval: 1.073, 1.153). Future research could seek to understand which mediating pathways, including changes in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing and hospital crowding, are most responsible for the associated changes in incidence.

The stronger acid suppression of PPIs may reduce the rate of bleeding but enhance infectious complications, specifically pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the occurrence and risk factors for GI hemorrhage, pneumonia, and CDI in critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pharmacoepidemiological cohort study was conducted of adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation for 24 hours or more and administered either an H2RA or PPI for 48 hours or more while intubated across 71 hospitals between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2008. Propensity score-adjusted and propensity-matched multivariate regression models were used to control for confounders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were secondary diagnoses of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)-coded GI hemorrhage, pneumonia, and CDI occurring 48 hours or more after initiating invasive ventilation. RESULTS Of 35 312 patients, 13 439 (38.1%) received H2RAs and 21 873 (61.9%) received PPIs. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2.1% vs 5.9%; P &amp;lt; .001), pneumonia (27% vs 38.6%; P &amp;lt; .001), and CDI (2.2% vs 3.8%; P &amp;lt; .001) occurred less frequently in the H2RA group. After adjusting for propensity score and covariates, odds ratios of GI hemorrhage (2.24; 95% CI, 1.81-2.76), pneumonia (1.2; 95% CI, 1.03-1.41), and CDI (1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.64) were greater with PPIs. Similar results were obtained in the propensity-matched models of 8799 patients in each cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Proton pump inhibitors are associated with greater risks of GI hemorrhage, pneumonia, and CDI than H2RAs in mechanically ventilated patients. Numerous other risk factors are apparent. These data warrant confirmation in comparative prospective studies. "

Culture data were reviewed to determine the causative organism. Infections analyzed included pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), bloodstream infection, and Clostridium difficile. Other parameters assessed included reason for admission, body mass index, pressor use, antibiotic duration, and disposition. Two hundred thirty-two patient records were reviewed. Patients without a known infection/source of sepsis had a mean procalcitonin of 3.95. Those with pneumonia had a procalcitonin of 20.59 (P = 0.03). Those with a UTI had a mean procalcitonin of 66.84 (P = 0.0005). Patients with a bloodstream infection had a mean procalcitonin of 33.30 (P = 0.003). Those with C. difficile had a procalcitonin of 47.20 (P = 0.004). When broken down by causative organisms, those with Gram-positive sepsis had a procalcitonin of 23.10 (P = 0.02) compared with those with Gram-negative sepsis at 32.75 (P = 0.02). Those with fungal infections had a procalcitonin of 42.90 (P = 0.001). These data suggest that procalcitonin elevation can help guide treatment by indicating likely causative organism and infection type.

This decision was made because the use of broad-spectrum-beta-lactam antibiotics is a known risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and for the selection of resistance. After the antibiotic formulary was changed, a retrospective audit was conducted to assess the effect of this change. Data from patients hospitalised between January 2011 and July 2012 for severe hospital-acquired pneumonia and treated empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam or amoxicillin+temocillin were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics of patients, data related to the episode of pneumonia, clinical success and incidence of significant diarrhoea and CDI were analysed. One hundred ninety-two episodes of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia in 188 patients were identified from hospital records. Ninety-eight patients received piperacillin/tazobactam and 94 amoxicillin+temocillin. At baseline, the two treatment groups were comparable, except that more patients with renal insufficiency were treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. Clinical success was comparable (80 versus 82 %; P = 0.86), but differences were observed between piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin+temocillin for the rates of significant diarrhoea (34 versus 4 %, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) and for CDI (7 versus 0 %, respectively; P &lt; 0.0028). This preliminary study suggests that the combination amoxicillin+temocillin is a viable alternative to piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia. This combination appears to be associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Further studies are needed to evaluate the place of amoxicillin+temocillin as empiric treatment of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia. "

Little research, however, exists on the prevalence and impact of CDI on patient and hospital outcomes among populations requiring such treatment. As such, the goal of this study was to examine the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of CDI among pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI) hospitalizations. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2009-2011), reflecting a 20% stratified sample of community hospitals in the United States, was used. A total of 593,038 pneumonia and 255,770 UTI discharges were included. Survey-weighted multivariable regression analyses were conducted to assess the predictors and impact of CDI among pneumonia and UTI discharges. RESULTS: A significantly higher prevalence of CDI was present among men with UTI (13.3 per 1,000) as compared to women (11.3 per 1,000). CDI was associated with higher in-hospital mortality among discharges for pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for men = 3.2, women aOR = 2.8) and UTI (aOR for men = 4.1, women aOR = 3.4). Length of stay among pneumonia and UTI discharges were also double upon presence of CDI. In addition, CDI increased the total charges by at least 75% and 55% among pneumonia and UTI discharges, respectively. Patient and hospital characteristics associated with CDI included being 65 years or older, Charlson Deyo index for comorbidity of 2 or more, Medicare as the primary payer, and discharge from urban hospitals, among both pneumonia and UTI discharges. CONCLUSION: CDI occurs frequently in hospitalizations among those discharged from hospital for pneumonia and UTI, and is associated with increased in-hospital mortality and health resource utilization. Interventions to mitigate the burden of CDI in these high-risk populations are urgently needed."

The risk factors for CDI were: age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.08), total number of antibiotic classes received (HR, 3.01 per class; 95% CI, 2.32-3.91), duration of antibiotic therapy (HR, 1.09 per day; 95% CI, 1.00-1.19 and hospitalization status (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 6.0-28.7). Antibiotic class was not an independent predictor of CDI when adjusted for these risk factors (P &gt; 0.05 by interaction testing). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that reducing the overall antibiotic burden, duration of antibiotic treatment and duration of hospital stay may reduce the incidence of CDI in patients with CAP."

Herein, we describe the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic strongyloidiasis and human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 coinfection, who developed significant clinical worsening after 24-48 hours of initiation of treatment with ivermectin (200 mug/kg daily). Oral albendazole (600 mg every 12 hours) was added to the regimen due to clinical deterioration. Notably, after a protracted clinical course with multiple complications, which included respiratory failure from gram-negative pneumonia and pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, Klebsiella meningitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and herpes labialis, the patient eventually recovered. Health-care providers should be aware that during the early days of antihelminthic treatment initiation, significant dissemination of S. stercoralis and worsening of the clinical scenario can occur."

A national evaluation was conducted to assess the duration of therapy for pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective medication utilization evaluation. SETTING: Thirty Veterans Affairs medical centers. PATIENTS: Inpatients discharged with a diagnosis of pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: A manual review of electronic medical records of inpatients discharged with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was conducted. Appropriate CAP therapy duration was defined as at least 5 days, and up to 3 additional days beginning the first day the patient achieved clinical stability criteria; the appropriate HCAP therapy duration was defined as 8 days. The duration of antimicrobial therapy for intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) inpatient administration, PO therapy dispensed upon discharge, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), hospital readmission, and death rates were measured. RESULTS: Of 3881 pneumonia admissions, 1739 met inclusion criteria (CAP [n = 1195]; HCAP [n = 544]). Overall, 13.9% of patients (CAP [6.9%], HCAP [29.0%]) received therapy duration consistent with guideline recommendations. The median (interquartile range) days of therapy were 4 days (3-6 days), 1 day (0-3 days), and 6 days (4-8 days) for inpatient IV, inpatient PO, and outpatient PO antimicrobials, respectively. CDI was rare but more common in patients who received therapy duration consistent with guidelines. Therapy duration was not associated with the readmission or mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobials were commonly prescribed for a longer duration than guidelines recommend. The majority of excessive therapy was completed upon discharge, identifying the need for strategies to curtail unnecessary use postdischarge.

It is estimated that CDI after pneumonia treatment is connected with a higher mortality than other causes of hospitalization. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the kind of antibiotic used for pneumonia treatment and mortality from post-pneumonia CDI. We addressed the issue by examining retrospectively the records of 217 patients who met the diagnostic criteria of CDI. Ninety four of those patients (43.3 %) came down with CDI infection after pneumonia treatment. Fifty of the 94 patients went through severe or severe and complicated CDI. The distribution of antecedent antibiotic treatment of pneumonia in these 50 patients was as follows: ceftriaxone in 14 (28 %) cases, amoxicillin with clavulanate in 9 (18 %), ciprofloxacin in 8 (16.0 %), clarithromycin in 7 (14 %), and cefuroxime and imipenem in 6 (12 %) each. The findings revealed a borderline enhancement in the proportion of deaths due to CDI in the ceftriaxone group compared with the ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, and imipenem groups. The corollary is that ceftriaxone should be shunned in pneumonia treatment. The study demonstrates an association between the use of a specific antibiotic for pneumonia treatment and post-pneumonia mortality in patients who developed CDI."

The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess mortality due to C. difficile infection (CDI) in patients treated for pneumonia. We identified 94 cases of post-pneumonia CDI out of the 217 patients with CDI. The mortality issue was addressed by creating a mortality risk models using logistic regression and multivariate fractional polynomial analysis. The patients' demographics, clinical features, and laboratory results were taken into consideration. To estimate the influence of the preceding respiratory infection, a pneumonia severity scale was included in the analysis. The analysis showed two statistically significant and clinically relevant mortality models. The model with the highest prognostic strength entailed age, leukocyte count, serum creatinine and urea concentration, hematocrit, coexisting neoplasia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In conclusion, we report on two prognostic models, based on clinically relevant factors, which can be of help in predicting mortality risk in C. difficile infection, secondary to the antibiotic treatment of pneumonia. These models could be useful in preventive tailoring of individual therapy."

Antibiotic treatment of HAP may lead to subsequent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Baseline data on the occurrence of CDI among HAP patients in China are currently unavailable. This study examines the risk and disease burden of CDI among HAP hospitalized patients (HAP-CDI). METHODS: We conducted a prospective study among ICU patients with HAP and hospital-onset diarrhea from January 2014 to December 2014 in a teaching hospital in China. All stool specimens were cultured for C. difficile which were typed by MLST. We used univariate and multivariable regression analyses to identify risk factors of HAP-CDI. FINDINGS: In total, 369 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Thirty-two patients tested C. difficile positive. Among the isolated C. difficile strains, 90.63% (29/32) isolates were toxinogenic. Various MLST types were identified. The incidence of HAP-CDI was 11.67/10,000 patient days (95% CI, 7.97-16.55). Nineteen patients died from complications. The attributable mortality rate was 5.15% (19/369). The mortality rate of HAP-CDI group was 13.79% which was higher than HAP-non-CDI group. Univariate analyses demonstrated that old age, receiving antibiotics (OR = 8.70) and glucocorticoids (OR = 7.71) 1 month prior to hospitalization, respiratory failure (OR = 3.28) and receiving antimicrobials during hospitalization (OR = 1.15) were the risk factors associated with CDI. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated the similar results. CONCLUSION: CDI was common among patients discharged from hospital for HAP at a university hospital. Prevention of the spreading of C. difficile among hospitalized patients is urgently needed."

The root cause underlying colonic stenosis is unclear and there is no fixed operation. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported on a male infant with progressive colonic stenosis caused by antibiotic-related colitis. The infant was admitted to our hospital with pneumonia but developed progressive abdominal distension and diarrhea following antibiotic treatment with meropenem. Initial testing of stool culture showed a Clostridium difficile infection. Additional testing with barium enema imaging showed stenosis at the junction of the sigmoid and descending colon at first and another stenosis occurred at the right half of the transverse colon 3 weeks later. Staged surgical treatment was performed with primary resections of the two parts suffering stenosis, ileostomy, and secondary intestinal anastomosis. A pathological exam then confirmed the diagnosis of colonic stenosis and the patient had an uneventful recovery and has been recovering well as evidenced by the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a review of the literature and our case report, we found that progressive colonic stenosis caused by colitis due to antibiotic-related Clostridium difficile infection is rare in infants. Infants with colitis and repeated abdominal distention, vomiting, and constipation should be treated with the utmost caution and screened. Despite this, clinical manifestations depended on the severity of the stenosis. Barium enema, colonoscopy, laprascopy or laparotomy and colonic biopsy are helpful for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. While both one-stage and multiple-stage operations are feasible, a staged operation should be used for multiple colonic stenoses."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study of 1995 adults with pneumonia admitted from four US hospital emergency departments. We used multivariable regressions to investigate the effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on 30-day mortality, length of stay, cost and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). To address indication bias, we developed a propensity score using multilevel (individual provider) generalised linear mixed models to perform inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to estimate the average treatment effect in the treated. We also manually reviewed a sample of mortality cases for antibiotic-associated adverse events. RESULTS: 39.7% of patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, but drug-resistant pathogens were recovered in only 3%. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with increased mortality in both the unweighted multivariable model (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.5-5.9; p&lt;0.001) and IPTW analysis (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.9-7.5; p&lt;0.001). Broad-spectrum antibiotic use by either analysis was also associated with longer hospital stay, greater cost and increased CDI. Healthcare-associated pneumonia was not associated with mortality independent of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. In manual review we identified antibiotic-associated events in 17.5% of mortality cases. CONCLUSION: Broad-spectrum antibiotics appear to be associated with increased mortality and other poor outcomes in community-onset pneumonia."

This study investigated infectious disease hospitalizations in the United States from 2001 to 2014. METHODS: Estimated rates of infectious disease hospitalizations were calculated by using the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample. Infectious disease hospitalizations were defined as hospitalizations with a principal discharge diagnosis of an infectious disease. Diagnoses according to site of infection and sepsis were examined, as was occurrence of in-hospital death. The leading nonsepsis infectious disease secondary diagnoses for hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of sepsis were identified. RESULTS: The mean annual age-adjusted infectious disease hospitalization rate was 1,468.2 (95% CI, 1,459.9-1,476.4) per 100,000 population; in-hospital death occurred in 4.22% (95% CI, 4.18-4.25) of infectious disease hospitalizations. The mean annual age-adjusted infectious disease hospitalization rate increased from 2001-2003 to 2012-2014 (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09), as did the percentage of in-hospital death (4.21% [95% CI, 4.13-4.29] to 4.30% [95% CI, 4.26-4.35]; P = .049). The diagnoses with the highest hospitalization rates among all sites of infection and sepsis diagnoses were the lower respiratory tract followed by sepsis. The most common nonsepsis infectious disease secondary diagnoses among sepsis hospitalizations were ""urinary tract infection,"" ""pneumonia, organism unspecified,"" and ""intestinal infection due to Clostridium [Clostridioides] difficile."" CONCLUSIONS: Although hospital discharge data are subject to limitations, particularly for tracking sepsis, lower respiratory tract infections and sepsis seem to be important contributors to infectious disease hospitalizations. Prevention of infections that lead to sepsis and improvements in sepsis management would decrease the burden of infectious disease hospitalizations and improve outcomes, respectively."

Objective: To examine predictors and outcomes associated with excess duration of antibiotic treatment. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 43 hospitals in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. Patients: 6481 general care medical patients with pneumonia. Measurements: The primary outcome was the rate of excess antibiotic treatment duration (excess days per 30-day period). Excess days were calculated by subtracting each patient's shortest effective (expected) treatment duration (based on time to clinical stability, pathogen, and pneumonia classification [community-acquired vs. health care-associated]) from the actual duration. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to calculate rate ratios to assess predictors of 30-day rates of excess duration. Patient outcomes, assessed at 30 days via the medical record and telephone calls, were evaluated using logit GEEs that adjusted for patient characteristics and probability of treatment. Results: Two thirds (67.8% [4391 of 6481]) of patients received excess antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics prescribed at discharge accounted for 93.2% of excess duration. Patients who had respiratory cultures or nonculture diagnostic testing, had a longer stay, received a high-risk antibiotic in the prior 90 days, had community-acquired pneumonia, or did not have a total antibiotic treatment duration documented at discharge were more likely to receive excess treatment. Excess treatment was not associated with lower rates of any adverse outcomes, including death, readmission, emergency department visit, or Clostridioides difficile infection. Each excess day of treatment was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events reported by patients after discharge. Limitation: Retrospective design; not all patients could be contacted to report 30-day outcomes. Conclusion: Patients hospitalized with pneumonia often receive excess antibiotic therapy. Excess antibiotic treatment was associated with patient-reported adverse events. Future interventions should focus on whether reducing excess treatment and improving documentation at discharge improves outcomes.

Further, HAI carry penalties in the era of hospital value-based care. However, very little is known about the incidence and outcomes of HAI among patients hospitalized with common cardiovascular conditions. Using a national database, we identified adults aged &gt;=18 years hospitalized with 5 common cardiovascular conditions, including heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, cardiogenic shock, and atrial fibrillation or flutter. We assessed for temporal trends in incidence, cost, length of stay (LOS), and mortality associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and Clostridium difficile infections. Between 2008 and 2015, we identified 159,021 hospitalizations &gt;=1 HAI (49.6% heart failure, 20.4% acute myocardial infarction, 10.5% coronary artery bypass grafting, 18.6% cardiogenic shock, and 11.9% atrial fibrillation or flutter). Clostridium difficile infections (75.4%) were the most common followed by catheter-associated urinary tract infections (15.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (7.9%), and central line-associated bloodstream infection (3.1%). Nearly half of the patients (46.3%) with HAI required discharge to a skilled care facility compared with 15.7% of patients who did not. After propensity matching, HAI remained associated with an increased LOS (4.9 vs 9.6 days, p &lt;0.0001), total hospital charges ($79,227 vs $50,699, p &lt;0.0001), and in-hospital mortality (13% vs 10.4%, p &lt;0.0001) compared with patients who did not acquire a HAI. In conclusion, patients with cardiovascular disease acquiring a HAI had substantially higher costs, LOS, and mortality."

A retrospective cohort study including patients with VAP from 2011 to 2017. Two groups were analysed: TMP-SMX group, including patients who had received TMP-SMX (as first-line and as de-escalation), and No-TMP-SMX group, including patients who had not received TMP-SMX treatment. Primary clinical outcome was mortality at 30 days from starting the antibiotic treatment (T30). Secondary outcomes were mortality at end of treatment (EoT), day survival at T30, and acquisition of multidrug-resistant bacteria during hospitalization in intensive care unit. Eighty cases of VAP were included and devised into two groups: No-TMP-SMX (31/80; 39%) and TMP-SMX (49/80; 61%). Univariate analysis showed no significant differences were found when the TMP-SMX group was compared with the No-TMP-SMX group, except for frequency of male gender (p = 0.025). No significant statistical correlations between mortality at T30 and individual factors were detected by the multivariate model. No cases of either severe allergy or Clostridium difficile disease were reported in the TMP-SMX and No-TMP-SMX groups. TMP-SMX treatment was not associated with higher mortality at EoT and T30 in comparison with the No-TMP-SMX group.

However, reliable data are scarcely available from the developing world. We aimed to analyze the incidence, epidemiology, microbial etiology, and outcomes of HAIs in an NCCU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in a high-income, developing country. METHODS: In this 3-year retrospective cohort study, all patients admitted to the NCCU at the Ibn Sina Hospital in Kuwait for >= 2 calendar days were included. Patient demographics, hospitalization, and details of ICU-acquired infections were evaluated. Patient-related outcomes included hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 913 patients with a total of 4921 ICU days, 79 patients had 109 episodes of HAIs. The overall incidence rate and incidence density of HAIs were 11.9/100 patients and 22.1/1000 ICU days, respectively. Multiple episodes of infection were documented in 29% of patients. The most prevalent infections were urinary tract infections (UTIs; 40/109 [37%]), bloodstream infections (30/109 [28%]), and pneumonia (16/109 [15%]). Seventy-six percent of infections were device-associated infections. A total of 158 pathogens were isolated, of which 109 were Gram-negative bacteria. Of the 40 Gram-positive bacteria, 22 were staphylococci. Seven infections were due to Clostridium difficile. There were 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 47% of which were methicillin resistant. Two episodes of UTIs were due to Candida species. There were 84 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 24% of which were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides and carbapenems. Klebsiella species were the most common pathogen (45/158 [28%]), causing pneumonia (11/33 isolates [33%]), bloodstream infections (12/37 isolates [32%]), and UTIs (16/52 isolates [31%]). One episode of bloodstream infection was due to multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumanii which was susceptible only to colistin. Only pneumonia was independently associated with mortality, while all HAIs that occurred were significantly associated with a prolonged ICU LOS. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first HAI surveillance study in an NCCU in Kuwait, and our results demonstrate the burden of HAIs on the neurologically injured patient, regardless of the site of infection. The high prevalence and resistant profile of HAIs in an NCCU in a developing country relative to a developed country has important implications for patient safety and emphasizes the need to strengthen collaboration between NCCU teams and infection control teams to prevent serious complications in this setting."

Methods: Between 18 July 2017 and 31 October 2017, we surveyed the infection prevention teams of all acute care hospitals in the Netherlands. The survey instrument was based on the 'Translating Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Research into Practice' (TRIP) questionnaire and adapted to the Dutch context. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the reported regular use of CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI prevention practices as well as the hospital characteristics. Results: Out of 72 eligible hospitals, 47 (65.3%) responded. Surveillance systems for monitoring CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI were present in 17.8, 95.4, 26.2, and 77.3% of hospitals, respectively. Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been established in 91.5% of participating hospitals. For CAUTI, the majority of hospitals regularly used aseptic technique during catheter insertion (95%) and portable bladder ultrasound scanners (86.1%). Intermittent catheterization and catheter stop-orders were regularly used by 65.8 and 62.2% of hospitals. For CLABSI, all hospitals regularly used maximum sterile barrier precautions and chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis. Avoidance of the femoral site for central line insertions was regularly used by 65.9% of hospitals. Urinary catheters and central-lines impregnated with antibiotics or antiseptics were rarely used (&lt;= 5%). Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of hospitals. With the exception of disposable thermometers (31.8%), all prevention practices to prevent CDI were regularly used by more than 80% of hospitals. Conclusions: Most Dutch hospitals report regular use of recommended practices for preventing CLABSI and CDI. Several specific practices to prevent CAUTI and VAP were less frequently used, however, providing an opportunity for improvement."

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. PATIENTS: This study included 1,963 CDI cases, January 2005 through December 2011. METHODS: We extracted location and time information for each case and ran the Knox, Mantel, and mean and maximum component size tests for time thresholds (T = 7, 14, and 21 days) and distance thresholds (D = 2, 3, 4, and 5 units; 1 unit = 5-6 m). All tests were implemented using Monte Carlo simulations, and random CDI cases were constructed by randomly permuting times of CDI cases 20,000 times. As a counterfactual, we repeated all tests on 790 aspiration pneumonia cases because aspiration pneumonia is a complication without environmental factors. RESULTS: Results from the Knox test and mean component size test rejected the null hypothesis of no spatiotemporal interaction (P &lt; .0001), for all values of T and D. Results from the Mantel test also rejected the hypothesis of no spatiotemporal interaction (P &lt; .0003). The same tests showed no such effects for aspiration pneumonia. Our results from the maximum component size tests showed similar trends, but they were not consistently significant, possibly because CDI outbreaks attributable to the environment were relatively small. CONCLUSION: Our results clearly show spatiotemporal interaction and clustering among CDI cases and none whatsoever for aspiration pneumonia cases. These results strongly suggest that environmental factors play a role in the onset of some CDI cases. However, our results are not inconsistent with the possibility that many genetically unrelated CDI cases occurred during the study period."

To reduce HAI, the largest integrated health care system in the United States-the Veterans Health Administration-was an early adopter of infection prevention policies and initiatives. Whether these efforts translated into increased use of practices to prevent HAI in Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals is unknown. Objective: To evaluate changes over time in infection prevention practices and the perception of the importance of infection prevention to hospital leadership. Design, Settings, and Participants: For this survey study, every 4 years between 2005 and 2017, infection preventionists were surveyed at all VA hospitals on use of practices associated with common HAIs, including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and (beginning in 2013) Clostridioides difficile infection. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2019, to July 1, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Reported regular use of key infection prevention practices and perceived importance of infection prevention to hospital leadership. Results: Between 2005 and 2017, 320 total surveys were completed with response rates ranging from 59% (73 of 124) in 2017 to 80% (95 of 119) in 2005. Use of 12 different infection prevention practices increased. Since 2013, 92% (69 of 75) to 100% of VA hospitals reported regular use of key infection prevention practices for C difficile infection and CLABSI. In contrast, adoption of many practices to prevent CAUTI, although increasing, have lagged. Despite reported increases in the use of some practices for VAP such as semirecumbent positioning (89% [79 of 89] in 2005 vs 97% [61 of 63] in 2017, P = .007 for trend) and subglottic secretion drainage (23% [19 of 84] in 2005 vs 65% [40 of 62] in 2017, P &lt; .001), use of other key practices such as daily interruptions of sedation (85% [55 of 65] in 2009 vs 87% [54 of 62] in 2017, P = .66) and early mobilization (81% [52 of 64] in 2013 vs 82% [51 of 62] in 2017, P = .88) has not increased. Antibiotic stewardship programs are now reported in nearly every VA hospital (97% [71 of 73]); however, some hospitals report practices for microbiologic testing for HAIs (eg, 22% [16 of 72] report routine urine culture testing in 2017) that could also contribute to antibiotic overuse. Conclusions and Relevance: From 2005 to 2017, reported use of 12 different infection prevention practices increased in VA hospitals. Areas for continued improvement of infection prevention practices appear to include CAUTI, certain VAP practices, and diagnostic stewardship for HAI. The reported adoption of many infection prevention practices in VA hospitals was higher than in non-VA hospitals. As hospitals continue to merge and health systems become increasingly integrated, these successes could help inform patient safety broadly."

","SPECIES:Clostridium difficileID:32065604TITLE:Empirical Anti-MRSA vs Standard Antibiotic Therapy and Risk of 30-Day Mortality in Patients Hospitalized for Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Importance: Use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia has increased owing to concern for resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of empirical anti-MRSA therapy with outcomes among patients with pneumonia is unknown, even for high-risk patients. Objective: To compare 30-day mortality among patients hospitalized for pneumonia receiving empirical anti-MRSA therapy vs standard empirical antibiotic regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted of all hospitalizations in which patients received either anti-MRSA or standard therapy for community-onset pneumonia in the Veterans Health Administration health care system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Subgroups of patients analyzed were those with initial intensive care unit admission, MRSA risk factors, positive results of a MRSA surveillance test, and positive results of a MRSA admission culture. Primary analysis was an inverse probability of treatment-weighted propensity score analysis using generalized estimating equation regression; secondary analyses included an instrumental variable analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 14 to November 20, 2019. Exposures: Empirical anti-MRSA therapy plus standard pneumonia therapy vs standard therapy alone within the first day of hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of 30-day all-cause mortality after adjustment for patient comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory results. Secondary outcomes included the development of kidney injury and secondary infections with Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, or gram-negative bacilli. Results: Among 88 605 hospitalized patients (86 851 men; median age, 70 years [interquartile range, 62-81 years]), empirical anti-MRSA therapy was administered to 33 632 (38%); 8929 patients (10%) died within 30 days. Compared with standard therapy alone, in weighted propensity score analysis, empirical anti-MRSA therapy plus standard therapy was significantly associated with an increased adjusted risk of death (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]), kidney injury (aRR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]), and secondary C difficile infections (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp infections (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.3]), and secondary gram-negative rod infections (aRR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]). Similar associations between anti-MRSA therapy use and 30-day mortality were found by instrumental variable analysis (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.9]) and among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (aRR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]), those with a high risk for MRSA (aRR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]), and those with MRSA detected on surveillance testing (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]). No significant favorable association was found between empirical anti-MRSA therapy and death among patients with MRSA detected on culture (aRR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.8-1.4]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that empirical anti-MRSA therapy was not associated with reduced mortality for any group of patients hospitalized for pneumonia. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that questions the value of empirical use of anti-MRSA therapy using existing risk approaches."

","SPECIES:Clostridium difficileID:32437825TITLE:Clostridioides difficile infection after pneumonia in older patients: Which antibiotic is at lower risk?ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a frequent and severe complication of antibiotic treatment in older patients hospitalized for acute pneumonia (AP). AIMS: We aimed to assess the burden and risk factors of CDI and to determine which of the usual antibiotics regimens is at lower risk for post-AP CDI incidence. METHODS: Among patients aged >75y hospitalized for AP in all departments of a university hospital between 2007 and 2017, all the 92 patients developing a CDI were compared with 213 patients without CDI. Factors associated with 1) in-hospital and one-year mortality, 2) CDI incidence were assessed using logistic regression models. FINDINGS: In patients with and without CDI after AP, mortality rates were respectively at 34% vs 20% in hospital and 63% vs 42% at one-year. After adjustment for confounders, CDI was associated with a two-fold risk of in-hospital and one-year mortality after pneumonia (Respective Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval), OR (95%CI): 1.95 (1.06-3.58) and 2.02 (1.43-7.31)). High number of antibiotics (Per antibiotic, OR (95%CI): 1.89 (1.18-3.06)), rather than antibiotics duration (Per day, OR 95%CI): 1.04 (0.96-1.11)) was associated with a higher risk of CDI. Compared with other antibiotics, use of penicillin + beta-lactamase inhibitors was associated with a lower risk of CDI (OR (95%CI): 0.43 (0.19 -0.99)) CONCLUSION: In older inpatients, CDI highly increase the burden of AP at both short and long term. If confirmed, these results suggest the preferential use of penicillin + beta-lactamase inhibitors for a lower incidence of CDI in older inpatients with AP."

","SPECIES:Clostridium difficileID:32508359TITLE:Impact of Pharmacist-Led Procalcitonin-Guided Antibiotic Therapy in Critically Ill Patients With Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Purpose: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a peptide that is released in response to bacterial infections. The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America pneumonia guidelines recommend PCT monitoring to help guide antibiotic discontinuation. Utilization of PCT is well described in the literature; however, there is a paucity of literature regarding pharmacists' involvement for using PCT in antibiotic interventions. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pharmacist-led intervention with PCT-guided antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with pneumonia. Methods: This was a pre-post study conducted at a 1368-bed community teaching hospital in the United States. A prospective cohort with pharmacist intervention utilizing PCT-algorithm guidance was compared with a retrospective historical cohort with standard therapy. Adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with pneumonia were included. The primary endpoint was duration of antibiotic therapy. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, reinitiation of antibiotic therapy, and the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection. Results: From August 2016 to July 2017, 113 patients were screened in the PCT group and 123 patients in the standard therapy group. Of these, 37 patients were included in the PCT group and 37 patients in the standard therapy group. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The antibiotic duration of therapy was 6.3 days in the PCT group versus 9.7 days in the standard therapy group (P < .001). There were no differences in secondary endpoints between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Clinical pharmacists' intervention with PCT-guided antibiotic therapy led to a reduction in the duration of antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with pneumonia without increasing complications."

For the purpose of examining the occurrence and prevalence of CDI, we reviewed all community-onset pneumonia patients who were admitted to our institute during the study period. A total of 406 patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 257 patients (63%) were male, and the median age was 79 years (range 19-103 years). Surprisingly, 155 CAP (88%) and all HCAP (100%) patients had one or more risk factors for CDI. Furthermore, 70 CAP (40%) and 157 HCAP (69%) patients had more than 3 risk factors for CDI. Despite these facts, probiotic medication for prevention of CDI were prescribed for 12 (7%) CAP and 15 (7%) HCAP patients as the initial treatment. Finally, 3% and 9% of CAP and HCAP patients had CDI after completing the treatment for pneumonia. Regarding the duration of antibiotic therapy, 146 CAP (82%) and 176 HCAP (77%) patients received it for longer than 8 days, even though bacteremia was not confirmed in those patients. In addition, 27 CAP (15%) and 26 HCAP (11%) patients received a combination antibiotic therapy as an initial treatment. They seemed to be unnecessary. Physicians should acknowledge community-onset pneumonia has several risk factors for CDI, and should avoid a longer than necessary antibiotic therapy and unnecessary combination antibiotic therapy for pneumonia patients with risk factors for CDI."

In addition to typical respiratory signs (dry cough, shortness of breathing), some patients may develop gastrointestinal and hepatological complications including diarrhea or acute hepatitis, respectively. Due to the close contact to the patient's secretion, the gastroenterologists are at increased risk of getting the infection. Therefore, a proper individual risk stratification before every endoscopic procedure is highly recommended. Endoscopy personnel should reduce exposure hazards by keeping a distance from the patient and using gloves, face masks, face shields and gowns. Taking into the consideration the fact that the virus proliferates in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, special attention should be given to handling with stool specimens. In patients obtaining FMT for recurrent C. difficile infection, recommended screening measures include donor's medical history and testing for SARS-CoV-2 presence in pharyngeal and stool specimens."

However, the adverse effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and hospital-acquired pneumonia have been reported. Abdominal septic shock is associated with increased risk of bleeding, CDI, and pneumonia; however, which ulcer prophylaxis might be associated with better outcomes in patients with septic shock after lower gastrointestinal tract perforation is unknown. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database from July 2010 to March 2015, we identified patients aged 18 years or older who received open abdominal surgery for lower gastrointestinal tract perforation and who used vasopressors and antibiotics within 2 days of admission. We performed propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to compare the outcomes between patients who received H2RA and those who received PPI within 2 days of admission. The outcomes included gastrointestinal bleeding requiring endoscopic hemostasis within 28 days of admission, 28-day mortality, CDI, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Results: The propensity score matching created 1088 pairs of patients who received H2RA or PPI within 2 days of admission. There were no significant differences between the H2RA and PPI groups regarding gastrointestinal bleeding requiring endoscopic hemostasis within 28 days of admission (0.74% vs 1.3%, risk ratio 0.57 (0.24-1.4), and P = 0.284), 28-day mortality (11.3% vs 12.9%, risk ratio 0.88 (0.68-1.1), and P = 0.386), CDI (0.64% vs 0.46%, risk ratio 1.4 (0.45-4.4), and P = 0.774), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (3.0% vs 4.3%, risk ratio 0.70 (0.45-1.1), and P = 0.138).

After the high impact of the pandemic, a wide clinical spectrum of late complications associated with COVID-19 are being observed. We report a case of a severe Clostridium difficile colitis in a post-treatment and recovered COVID-19 patient. A 64-year-woman with a one-month hospital admission for severe bilateral pneumonia associated with COVID-19 and 10 days after discharge presented with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Severe C. difficile-associated colitis is diagnosed according to clinical features and CT findings. An urgent pancolectomy was performed due to her bad response to conservative treatment. Later evolution slowly improved to recovery. C. difficile-associated colitis is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. Significant patient-related risk factors for C. difficile infection are antibiotic exposure, older age, and hospitalisation. Initial therapeutic recommendations in our country included administration broad-spectrum antibiotics to all patients with bilateral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2. These antibiotics are strongly associated with C. difficile infection. Our patient developed a serious complication of C. difficile due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The appearance of late digestive symptoms in patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 should alert clinicians to the possibility of C. difficile infection. The updated criteria for severe colitis and severe C. difficile infection should be considered to ensure an early effective treatment for the complication."

METHODS: We analyzed data from 105,184 STEMI-CS patients using the NIS database from the years 2005-2014. NI was defined as infections of more than or equal to three days, comprising of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), urinary tract infection (UTI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), bacteremia, and skin related infections. Outcomes of the impact of NI on STEMI-CS included in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS) and costs. Significant associations of NI in patients admitted with STEMI-CS were also identified. RESULTS: Overall, 19.1% (20,137) of patients admitted with STEMI-CS developed NI. Trends of NI have decreased from 2005-2014. The most common NI were UTI (9.2%), followed by HAP (6.8%), CLABSI (1.5%), bacteremia (1.5%), skin related infections (1.5%), and CDI (1.3%). The strongest association of developing a NI was increasing LOS (7-9 days; OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.75-2.26; >9 days; OR: 4.51; 95% CI: 4.04-5.04 compared to 4-6 days as reference). Increased mortality risk among patients with NI was significant, especially those with sepsis-associated NI compared to those without sepsis (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 2.72-3.20). Patients with NI were found to be associated with significantly longer LOS and higher costs, irrespective of percutaneous mechanical circulatory support placement. CONCLUSIONS: NI were common among patients with STEMI-CS. Those who developed NI were at a greater risk of in-hospital mortality, increased LOS and costs."

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at an increased risk for CDI. A recent study showed an overall improvement in mortality amongst hospitalized individuals with CDI, but it is unclear if this benefit extends to SOT recipients. METHODS: We scrutinized the 2015 and 2016 National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest all-payer inpatient database in the United States for CDI data in patients with SOT. SOT was defined as any recipient who had received a heart, lung, liver, intestinal, kidney, pancreas, or combined thoracic and/or abdominal organ transplantation. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia or urinary tract infection were adjusted for in our analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay and total hospital charges. RESULTS: A total of 105,780 hospital discharges of SOT recipients were included. The incidence of CDI was 3,554 (3.36%) among SOTs. CDI was associated with a higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.56-2.20, p<0.01), longer length of hospital stay (mean difference 5.07 days, 95%CI 4.43-5.71, p<0.01) and higher total hospital charges (mean difference 43,958 US dollars, p<0.01).

Respiratory tract infections were the most common, followed by surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, primary bloodstream infections, Clostridium difficile infections, and central nervous system infections. A regression model showed length of stay at the moment of HAI detection, urinary catheter, central venous catheter, and antibiotic therapy to be the most important predictors of HAI prevalence, yielding a significant adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted R2) of 0.2780. This will provide future infection control programs with specific HAI to focus on in order to introduce a proper prophylaxis and to limit exposure whenever possible."

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can contribute to multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) and Clostridioides difficile (CDI) infections seen in ESRD. This study investigates antibiotic prescribing practices in ESRD across New York State (NYS). METHODS: Retrospective case-control study from 2016 to 2017 of NYS ESRD and non-ESRD patients analyzing Medicare part B billing codes, 7 days before and 3 days after part D claims. Frequencies of each infection, each antibiotic, dosages, and the antibiotics associated with infections were assessed using chi-square analysis. A NYS small dialysis organization comprising approximately 2200 patients was also analyzed. Outcomes measured were the frequencies of infections and of each antibiotic prescribed. Incidence measures included antibiotics/1000 and individuals receiving antibiotics/1000. RESULTS: 48,100 infections were treated in 35,369 ESRD patients and 2,544,443 infections treated in 3,777,314 non-ESRD patients. ESRD patients were younger, male, and African American. ESRD and non-ESRD patients receiving antibiotics was 520.29/1000 and 296.48/1000, respectively (p<0.05). The prescription incidence was 1359.95/1000 ESRD vs 673.61/1000 non-ESRD patients. In 36%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole dosage was elevated by current ESRD guidelines. Top infectious categories included non-specific symptoms, skin, and respiratory for ESRD; and respiratory, nonspecific symptoms, and genitourinary in non-ESRD. CONCLUSIONS: This study Identifies issues with appropriate antibiotic usage stressing the importance of antibiotic education to nephrologist and non-nephrologist providers.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and risk factors for CDI in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center assessment of the frequency and risk factors for CDI in patients with COVID-19 and in the pre-pandemic era. The analysis included 441 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 2,961 patients hospitalized before the pandemic. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the incidence of CDI during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period: 10.9% vs 2.6%, p <0.0001. Risk factors for CDI in COVID-19 patients included: age, length of hospital stay, occurrence of diarrhea during hospitalization, antibiotics other than azithromycin, coexistence of nervous system disease, and chronic kidney disease - all had weak association with CDI development. Multivariable logistic regression model indicated the presence of other unmeasured variables which had an impact on CDI incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS: We have observed a significantly higher incidence of CDI in patients with COVID-19. Antibiotic treatment was an important risk factor, although the effect was weak. Other drugs used during the pandemic did not have an impact. Possible causes may include fecal microbiota disruption by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but more studies are needed to prove this hypothesis."

CD4+ T lymphopenia and an inverted CD4:CD8+ T-cell ratio may be present. Here we report 5 patients with GS and infectious complications who were seen at 3 institutions between 1983 and 1999. Three patients had recurrent sinopulmonary infections, 3 had severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and 1 had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Review of the literature identified 46 other reports of infections in GS patients. The infections reported in all 51 patients included recurrent sinopulmonary infection (19 cases with documented respiratory pathogens), generally with encapsulated bacteria, most often Haemophilus influenzae (11 cases); CMV disease (5 cases); bacteremia (7 cases); oral or esophageal candidiasis (6 cases); persistent mucocutaneous candidiasis (5 cases); chronic diarrhea (5 cases with documented stool pathogens); urinary tract infections (4 cases); P. carinii pneumonia (3 cases); tuberculosis (2 cases); Kaposi sarcoma (1 case); disseminated varicella (1 case); candidemia (1 case); wound infection with Clostridium perfringens (1 case); Mycoplasma arthritis (1 case); and other infections. Patients with GS present with a spectrum of sinopulmonary infections and pathogens similar to common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Compared with patients with CVID, opportunistic infections, including severe CMV disease, P. carinii pneumonia, and mucocutaneous candidiasis, appear to be more common in patients with GS, and patients with GS may have a worse prognosis. GS should be ruled out in patients with thymoma or CVID who develop severe, especially opportunistic, infections. Treatment with intravenous immune globulin is recommended for all patients with GS."

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENT: A 12-yr-old male with sickle cell disease developed persistent necrotizing pneumonia of the left lung following exchange transfusion for acute chest syndrome and hyper-hemolytic syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: An endobronchial blocker was placed into the left main stem bronchus for lung isolation and application of continuous positive airway pressure to the left lung for 48 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 14 days of persistent atelectasis of the left lung despite thorascopic decortication and multiple bronchoscopies, our patient had substantial lung aeration within 48 hrs of continuous positive airway pressure applied via the endobronchial blocker. Lung resection was avoided and the patient was successfully extubated 2 days after removal of the blocker.

","SPECIES:Clostridium perfringensID:171947TITLE:Necrotizing pneumonia and empyema due to Clostridium perfringens. Report of a case and review of the literature.ABSTRACT:Clostridia are rare causes of pleuropulmonary infections in the absence of penetrating chest injuries; only 10 previous cases have been reported from civilian practice. An additional case of a rapidly progressive, necrotizing pneumonia and empyema is reported. Clostridial pneumonia is more likely to occur in patients with underlying pleuropulmonary disease. Unlike clostridial myonecrosis, it is rarely associated with toxemia; its mortality rate is comparable to that of nonclostridial pleuropulmonary infections. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy with surgical drainage of the empyema is the treatment of choice. Among the cases reviewed, an iatrogenic cause of infection involving an invasive procedure into the pleural cavity could be identified in seven of 11 cases. Aspiration of oropharyngeal contents was the likely route of infection in three other cases. In the remaining case, bacteremic seeding of the pleural cavity was the most probable mode of infection."

Clostridial species infecting the pleuropulmonary structures characteristically cause a necrotizing pneumonia with involvement of the pleura. Most cases have iatrogenic causes usually due to invasive procedures into the pleural cavity, such as thoracentesis or thoracotomy, or penetrating chest injuries. Rarely clostridia pleuropulmonary infections are not related to these factors. The clinical course of pleuropulmonary clostridial infections can be very variable, but they may be rapid and fatal. We report a rare case of necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis due to Clostridium perfringens not related to iatrogenic causes or injuries in an 82 years old woman."

From June 2004 to April 2005, an estimated 105 javelinas died in a mortality event that occurred in Tucson, Arizona, and neighboring areas. Clinical signs observed in sick animals included emaciation, dehydration, lethargy, and diarrhea. In addition, some animals showed labored breathing and hind limb weakness. We necropsied 34 animals, and enteritis was the most frequent clinical sign, followed by colitis, pulmonary congestion, and pneumonia. The only consistent findings were isolations of Clostridium perfringens type A and multiple Salmonella serotypes. Although it is likely that these javelinas ultimately succumbed to salmonellosis, it is unclear whether other unidentified underlying factors were involved. This is the first reported case of widespread salmonellosis in free-ranging javelinas."

Among the 22 deaths caused by infection occurred during this period, 6 deaths were attributed to direct causes from genital tract origin, confirming thus the decrease in direct maternal deaths by infection during the last ten years. On the contrary, indirect maternal deaths by infection, from extragenital origin, doubled during the same period, with 16 deaths in the last triennium, dominated by winter respiratory infections, particularly influenza: the 2009-2010 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic was the leading cause of indirect maternal mortality by infection during the studied period. The main infectious agents involved in maternal deaths from direct causes were Streptococcus A, Escherichia Coli and Clostridium perfringens: these bacterias were responsible for toxic shock syndrome, severe sepsis, secondary in some cases to cellulitis or necrotizing fasciitis. Of the 6 deaths due to direct infection, 4 were considered avoidable because of inadequate management: delayed or missed diagnosis, delayed or inadequate initiation of a specific medical and/or surgical treatment. Of the 16 indirect maternal deaths due to infection causes, the most often involved infectious agents were influenza A (H1N1) virus and Streptococcus pneumonia with induced purpura fulminans: the absence of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, delayed diagnosis and emergency initiation of a specific treatment, were the main contributory factors to these deaths and their avoidability in 70% of the cases analyzed."

The physicians of various specialties should be familiar with the symptoms of botulism because its sings concern the nervous system, the organ of sight and the gastrointestinal system. In older persons with coexisting chronic diseases some symptoms of botulism may be not distinctive or may mimic exacerbation of early existing diseases. The handbook descriptions present the food borne botulism as dramatic and often deadly disease. However in some cases this disease can have mild course and poor symptomatology. Two cases of food borne botulism with different clinical course are presented in this paper, when the correct diagnosis was established with delay. A 78-year-old man was admitted with the symptoms of pneumonia and dizziness of uncertain aetiology.

Methods: Clinical data of 3 infants with type B botulism who were admitted to Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics from May to November 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Botulinum toxin was detected in fecal samples or fecal enrichment solution of the patients, and Clostridium botulinum was cultured and isolated from fecal samples. Results: The age of onset of the patients (two boys and one girl) was 3, 3 and 8 months old, respectively. Two cases had the onset in May and one case had the onset in November. There were two cases with mixed feeding and one case with breast feeding. One case's family members engaged in meat processing. All of them were previously healthy. All the children presented with acute flaccid paralysis, cranial nerve involvement and difficult defecation. Two cases had secondary urinary tract infection. Electromyograms of two cases showed that action potential amplitude of the motor nerve were lower than those of their peers. After treatments including intravenous human immunoglobulin, respiratory tract management, urethral catheterization, nasal feeding, etc., three cases recovered completely 2 to 4 months later. Type B botulinum toxin was detected in the fecal diluent of one patient, and the TPGYT enrichment solution and cooked meet medium of the feces of 3 patients, respectively. Clostridium botulinum B was identified from the feces of 3 infants after culture, isolation and purification. Conclusions: Combined with typical clinical manifestations including acute flaccid paralysis, cranial nerve involvement symptoms and difficult defecation examination, infant botulism can be clinically diagnosed. The detection of fecal botulinum toxin and the culture and isolation of Clostridium botulinum are helpful for the diagnosis."

Forty-three were caused by Clostridium botulinum type B. Progressive weakness necessitated ventilatory support in 39 infants. Complications during hospitalization included otitis media in 13 patients and aspiration pneumonia in 11. Eight infants developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and two developed adult respiratory distress syndrome. One infant died of progressive bradycardia despite adequate control of ventilation. Manifestations of autonomic nervous system dysfunction recognized on admission to the hospital were constipation, distention of the urinary bladder, and decreased salivation and tearing. During hospitalization, some infants had unexpected fluctuations of skin color, blood pressure, and heart rate. Infants' strength improved despite persistent intestinal elaboration of toxin. C botulinum was isolated from seven of nine home or work environments sampled. All 44 infants were white and were receiving breast milk at the time of onset of symptoms. The majority had first feedings of nonhuman food substances within 4 weeks prior to onset of symptoms. Delineation of fecal flora in seven infants revealed predominance of enterobacteriaceae. Perturbations of intestinal flora during infancy, especially at weaning, may cause transient permissiveness to colonization by C botulinum."

The most common symptoms of tetanus are trismus (100%), dysphagia (70.5%), dysarthria (35.2%), and neck stiffness (29.4%). Respiratory failure, laryngeal spasm, seizure, chest pain, nausea/vomiting, opisthotonus, back pain, and rigid abdominal wall can also be observed during progression of the disease. However, there has been no report of periocular discomfort as an initial manifestation after endoscopic sleep surgery in a patient with tetanus. Here, we report a patient who underwent endoscopic sleep surgery with a concurrent diagnosis of tetanus infection presenting with atypical periocular discomfort as the initial symptom. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 63-year-old man complaining of sleep apnea, snoring, and daytime sleepiness visited our department. He subsequently underwent sleep surgery (anterior pharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy, septoplasty, microdebrider-assisted inferior turbinoplasty, and an endoscopic sinus surgery) for the treatment of his newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. After 3 weeks of surgery, he visited the outpatient clinic of our department with right side periocular discomfort. DIAGNOSES: Four days after presenting with periocular discomfort, he was diagnosed with tetanus by presenting trismus, jaw pain, dysphagia, and ptosis at an emergency department of a different hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Tetanus immunoglobulin and antibiotics were administered. OUTCOMES: His symptoms then resolved after a month without sequelae. LESSONS: Although periocular discomfort is atypical and is not uncommon after nasal and oral surgeries, care should be taken when patients present with periocular pain because it could be a rare initial symptom of tetanus."

The present article describes a case of a 48-year-old Spanish woman, an ex-convict and IDU with infection antecedents of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV), who was admitted to the Emergency Department of a University Hospital with cervical rigidity and trismus. In a few hours, a neurological and respiratory deterioration was observed, resulting in admittance to the intensive care unit under the suspicion of a generalized tetanus infection. The treatment included hemodynamic support and respiratory therapy, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, sedatives, and tetanus immunoglobulin. Her stay in the ICU lasted 47 days. The clinical suspicion, the antecedents of risk, and the verification of the vaccination records should provide early guidance for diagnostics and the establishment of a treatment in these cases."

Sporadic case reports of cytomegalovirus community-acquired pneumonia have appeared. We studied 443 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization to define the role of cytomegalovirus in this illness. Four patients (0.9%) had good evidence that cytomegalovirus caused their pneumonia: 2 had the virus isolated from pulmonary tissue and 2 had cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies visualized in this tissue. An additional 14 patients had serologic evidence (a fourfold rise in the complement fixation tests) of cytomegalovirus infection. Analysis of these 18 patients suggest, that cytomegalovirus plays a role in community-acquired pneumonia. Six (33%) of the patients were immunosuppressed. Six others had concomitant infections: Chlamydia trachomatis (3); Epstein-Barr virus and M. pneumoniae (1); and bacteremia with Group B streptococcus and Bacteroides fragilis plus Eubacterium lentum (1 each). Seven patients (39%) required assisted ventilation, four of whom developed secondary bacterial pneumonia. Five (28%) died. Only two patients had a clinical and radiographic picture suggestive of a viral illness as a cause of the pneumonia. Three patients had atypical lymphocytes in their peripheral blood film. We found that the prevalence of complement fixing antibody to cytomegalovirus increased with age. Such antibody was lacking among those in the 16-20 year group while it peaked at 65% for males and at 78% for females ages 91-100 years. Despite the fact that 42.2% of the adults lacked antibody to cytomegalovirus, community-acquired pneumonia due to this virus is uncommon and does not justify routine serological testing for such infection among patients with community-acquired pneumonia."

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A 12-bed medical ICU in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 30 adult patients with documented nosocomial maxillary sinusitis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using appropriate microbiological techniques, 33 anaerobic bacterial strains were isolated in 18/30 patients (60 %) with nosocomial sinusitis. Anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 13 patients (72 %), whereas in 5 patients (28 %) only anaerobic strains were isolated in sinus puncture cultures. The most frequently isolated species were Prevotella sp. (n = 20, 60 %) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 5, 15 %). The production of beta -lactamase was demonstrated in 13/27 gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. All patients in whom anaerobic bacteria were isolated from transnasal punctures had had a nasogastric tube. Patients in whom anaerobic bacteria were isolated more frequently had neurological disorders upon admission (p &lt; 0.02). Ten patients (30 %) had nosocomial pneumonia, 8 of whom had at least one identical strain in both lung and sinus cultures, including 2 patients with anaerobic bacteria isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Using appropriate microbiological techniques, anaerobic bacteria were frequently isolated in nosocomial sinusitis. If necessary, the empirical choice of antimicrobial therapy in patients with nosocomial sinusitis should take into account these results."

Clinical manifestations range from simple aspiration to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonias to chronic infections, such as lung abscess and empyema. Implicated pathogens are usually of endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections is based on recovering the etiological agent from clinical specimens. Appropriate specimens include pleuml fluid, transtracheal aspirates, transthoracic aspirates and fiberoptic bronchoscopic aspirates. Collection and transport of uncontaminated specimens is crucial to the recovery of the causative agents. Evaluation of a Gram's stain of clinical material provides a guide to initial therapy. Pigmented and non-pigmented Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus species, and Bacteriodes species are the most commonly recovered anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections. Successful treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections requires a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical interventions. Routine susceptibility testing of recovered isolates is rarely warranted."

","SPECIES:FusobacteriumID:12441902TITLE:The evolution of Lemierre syndrome: report of 2 cases and review of the literature.ABSTRACT:Lemierre syndrome (postanginal septicemia) is caused by an acute oropharyngeal infection with secondary septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and frequent metastatic infections. A high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the usual etiologic agent. The disease progresses in several steps. The first stage is the primary infection, which is usually a pharyngitis (87.1% of cases). This is followed by local invasion of the lateral pharyngeal space and IJV septic thrombophlebitis (documented in 71.5% of cases), and finally, the occurrence of metastatic complications (present in 90% of cases at the time of diagnosis). A sore throat is the most common symptom during the primary infection (82.5% of cases). During invasion of the lateral pharyngeal space and IJV septic thrombophlebitis, a swollen and/or tender neck is the most common finding (52.2% of patients) and should be considered a red flag in patients with current or recent pharyngitis. The most common site of metastatic infection is the lungs (79.8% of cases). In contrast to the preantibiotic era, cavitating pneumonia and septic arthritis are now uncommon. Most patients (82.5%) had fever at some stage during the course of the disease. Gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were common (49.5% of cases). An elevated white blood cell count occurred in 75.2% of cases. Hyperbilirubinemia with slight elevation of liver enzyme levels occurred in one-third of patients, but frank jaundice was uncommon, in contrast to its high frequency reported in the preantibiotic era. We conclude that, most likely as a consequence of widespread antibiotic use for pharyngeal infections, the typical course of the disease has changed since Lemierre's original description. The typical triad in our series was: pharyngitis, a tender/swollen neck, and noncavitating pulmonary infiltrates. The previous classical description of severe sepsis with cavitating pneumonia and septic arthritis was not commonly seen in our review. Mortality was low in our series (6.4%), but significant morbidity occurred, which was likely preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. The pathophysiology, natural history, diagnostic methods for internal jugular vein thrombosis, and management are discussed."

Data collection included demographic information, Activity of Daily Living, Plaque Index, antimicrobial therapy, and outcome. Out of the 67 pathogens identified, Gram-negative enteric bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (49%), followed by anaerobic bacteria (16%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12%). The most commonly encountered anaerobes were Prevotella and Fusobacterium species. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli were recovered in conjunction with 55% of anaerobic isolates. The Plaque Index did not differ significantly between the aerobic (2.2 +/- 0.4) and the anaerobic group (2.3 +/- 0.3). Functional status was the only determinant of the presence of anaerobic bacteria. Although seven cases with anaerobic isolates received initially inadequate antimicrobial therapy, six had effective clinical response. The crude mortality was 33% for the aerobic and 36% for the anaerobic group (p = 0.9). Stepwise multivariate analysis identified hypoalbuminemia (p &lt; 0.001) and the burden of comorbid diseases (p &lt; 0.001) as independent risk factors of poor outcome. In view of the rising resistance to antimicrobial agents, the importance of adding anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia in institutionalized elders needs to be reexamined."

They are involved in infections such as pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess and empyema. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic infections is based on recovering the etiological agents from clinical materials. Appropriatte specimens include: pus, purulent fluid, biopsy specimen of lung, transtracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Lower respiratory infections are usually either polymicrobial or mixed anaerobic-aerobic infections. Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Prevotella and Bacteroides are the most common anaerobes. Anaerobic bacteria are susceptible to metronidazole, tinidazole (exception of Gram-positive rods), amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and clindamycin. Treatment includes an antibiotics regimen with an agent active against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (therapy with 2 or 3 antimicrobial drugs)."

Males accounted for 78 cases and females 20 cases. Thirteen pediatric patients ranged in age from 17 days to 4 years, while the 85 adult cases ranged from 16 to 89 years (mean: 58.4 years). The mortality rate increased with age. Fifty-three cases of community-acquired empyema thoracis consisted of 24 with no underlying disease (including 13 pediatric cases), and 29 with diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver damage or chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Forty-five nosocomial empyema cases occurred after chest operation or thoracocentesis, or due to a subdiaphragmatic pathogenic condition or congestive heart failure complicated with aspiration pneumonia. In this series, 63 patients (64.3%) had para- or post-pneumonic empyema. Compared with the community-acquired infection cases, the mortality rate of the nosocomial infection cases was very high. Seventy-eight cases were culture-positive, including 3 positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The remaining 20 cases were culture-negative. In 75 cases of culture-positive pleural fluid, aerobic bacteria were isolated from 31 cases (mortality rate: 22.6%), anaerobes mixed with aerobes from 21 cases (mortality rate: 52.4%), and anaerobes only from 23 cases (mortality rate: 21.7%). Thus, the mortality rate of mixed infected cases was highest. Anaerobes were frequently isolated from the community-acquired empyema cases, and were often found in para- or postpneumonic lesions, including aspiration pneumonia. The most commonly encountered aerobe was Staphylococcus aureus. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroides spp., microaerophilic streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. were most common. A single organism was isolated in pure culture from 39 cases. Single organisms isolated from fluids were more frequently aerobes (25) than anaerobes (14). The cases harboring Bacteroides spp. showed the worst outcome, with 11 deaths in 25 such cases."

In Norway, 11,495 hospitalized days were recorded for acute infections (influenza and pneumonia excluded) in the upper airways in 2008. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by both 1): symptoms of nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, and/or facial pain/pressure and 2): endoscopic signs of mucopurulent discharge from middle meatus and/or CT changes within the osteomeatal complex/sinuses. After 12 weeks of symptoms the definition changes to chronic rhinosinusitis. With antibiotic treatment of complicated ABRS we see fewer severe complications, but they still occur. Due to anatomical proximity of the orbit and intracranial structures a localized spread of the infection is especially unfortunate and potentially dangerous.

Systemic infections due to F.necrophorum are known as Lemierre's syndrome, postanginal sepsis or necrobacillosis. The most common clinical course of severe infections in humans is a progressive illness from tonsillitis to septicemia in previously healthy young adults. A septic thrombophlebitis arising from the tonsillar veins and extending into the internal jugular vein leads to septicemia and septic emboli contributing to the development of necrotic abscesses especially in lungs and other tissues such as liver, bone and joints. In this case report, a previously healthy man with pneumonia and empyema due to F.necrophorum has been presented. A 22 year-old man suffering from sore throat for seven days was admitted to emergency department with ongoing fever and dysphagia for three days. On admission he was already taking amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and his complaints were relieved with continuation of therapy to a total of 10 days. However, five days after the cessation of treatment he developed productive cough, fever and generalized myalgia.

Levofloxacin therapy was started based on the diagnosis of pneumonia. While polymorphonuclear leucocytes and intracellular gram-negative bacilli were seen in Gram stained sputum smear, sputum culture was reported as normal flora. Although the patient's status had started to improve with treatment, his condition deteriorated with development of fever and dyspnea. Chest X-ray revealed consolidation, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion and air-fluid level on the right. Meropenem, clarithromycin and linezolid were initiated and a chest tube was inserted with the preliminary diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia, empyema and type-1 respiratory failure. While there was no growth on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture, thoracentesis material inoculated into thioglycolate broth revealed turbidity. Further inoculation onto Schaedler agar which was incubated under anaerobic conditions, yielded growth of catalase negative, indol positive, gram-negative anaerobic bacilli identified as F.necrophorum by BBL Crystal system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The detailed history of the patient revealed that fish bone had stuck in his throat a week ago. Clarithromycin and linezolid were discontinued and he was recovered within six weeks of meropenem treatment. F.necrophorum infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent head and neck infections with rapidly progressive metastatic necrotic lesions especially in healthy young adults and clindamycin or metranidazol should be added to the treatment protocols."

The most frequent causative agent is Fusobacterium necrophorum, an anaerobic bacillus found in normal oropharyngeal flora. Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a cause of Lemierre syndrome in the last decade. We report a case of a 24-year-old man who developed septic IJV thrombosis and necrotizing pneumonia due to S. aureus from an infected hematoma in the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy with few cases needing anticoagulation. A good outcome is dependent upon an awareness of the condition, a high index of suspicion, and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. Recognition of S. aureus as a cause of Lemierre syndrome can guide the choice of initial antibiotics to cover this virulent pathogen. "

Since the introduction of antibiotics, the morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome have been dramatically reduced. This syndrome is characterized by a pharyngeal infection, which leads to the development of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with septic emboli, which usually spread into the lung. Sometimes the syndrome can be revealed by other unusual clinical symptoms. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a young patient with an atypical pleural infection associated with pharyngeal infection and thrombosis from the internal jugular vein. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome is mainly clinical, based on a range of suggesting symptoms. Confirmation and monitoring of the condition can be done by ultra-sound and/or contrast enhanced computed tomography. Treatment is based on long-term, high-dose antibiotic therapy and eventually surgical drainage of the infected collection with surgical excision of the internal jugular vein where there is extensive thrombosis. The important message is that in the context of a young patient without comorbidity, who presents with a significant infectious pleurisy, it is important to consider this clinical complication."

To determine whether the positive reaction was due to cross-reactivity, we separately tested the isolates from the pleural fluid samples, along with collection and reference strains. All patients had polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic positive cultures, including Parvimonas micra in every case. In all cases, 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction sequencing yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum. Samples for culture and specific polymerase chain reaction were negative for Streptococcus pneumoniae. We found that the false-positive PATB finding was likely due to P micra, a previously unknown cross-reactivity. In case of aspiration pneumonia risk factors, a positive PATB result must be interpreted with caution because there can be a false positivity due to anaerobic infection or co-infection."

Evidence-based management includes early administration of empiric antibiotics against plausible bacterial pathogens while awaiting results of microbiologic cultures. However, in over 60% of pneumonia cases, no causative pathogen is identified with conventional diagnostic techniques. In this case report, we demonstrate how direct-from-sample sequencing of bacterial DNA could have identified the multiple culprit pathogens early in the disease course to guide appropriate antibiotic management. CASE REPORT A previously healthy, 21-year-old man presented with neck pain and fever and rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was found to have septic thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome), with blood cultures growing Fusobacterium necrophorum. While his antibiotics were narrowed to piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy, his clinical condition worsened, but repeated efforts to define an additional/alternative respiratory pathogen resulted in negative cultures. He eventually developed bilateral empyemas growing Mycoplasma hominis. Once azithromycin was added to the patient's regimen, he improved dramatically. Retrospective sequencing of consecutive endotracheal aspirates showed Fusobacterium as the dominant pathogen early in the course, but with significant and increasing Mycoplasma abundance several days prior to clinical detection. CONCLUSIONS Had sequencing information been available to the treating clinicians, the causative pathogens could have been detected earlier, guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy and perhaps preventing his clinical complications. Real-time bacterial DNA sequencing has the potential to shift the diagnostic paradigm in severe pneumonia."

The syndrome begins as a pharyngeal infection. Untreated, the infection progresses to involve the ipsilateral internal jugular vein, resulting in septic thrombophlebitis with direct spread from the neck to the lungs causing multifocal necrotizing pneumonia. The teenager we present in this report had neither a preceding pharyngeal infection nor Doppler ultrasonographic evidence for the presence of deep neck vein thrombi, leading us to explore alternative mechanisms for her pneumonia. We propose the possibility that her behavior of frequent vaping led to sufficient pharyngeal irritation such that F necrophorum colonizing her oropharynx was inhaled directly into her lungs during electronic cigarette use. Preexisting, but not yet recognized, vaping-related lung injury may have also contributed to her risk of developing the infection. The patient was hospitalized for 10 days.

Modern physicians have ""forgotten"" this disease. The most common causative agent of Lemierre's syndrome is Fusobacterium necrophorum, followed by Fusobacterium nucleatum and anaerobic bacteria such as streptococci, staphylococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The causative focus mostly originated from pharyngitis or tonsillitis, accounting for over 85% of the cases of Lemierre's syndrome. Pneumonia or pleural empyema is the most common metastatic infection in Lemierre's syndrome. Antimicrobial therapy should be prescribed for 3-6 weeks. The treatment regimens include metronidazole and beta-lactam antibiotics. In recent years, the antibiotic stewardship program has resulted in decreased antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory tract infections. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome has increased over the past decade. F. necrophorum is an underestimated cause of acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

Predisposing conditions include prominent dental disease, chronic upper respiratory tract infections and reduced consciousness. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci are the most frequently encountered organisms. The clinical presentations are lung abscess, lung gangrene and empyema, which all tend to take a slow and indolent course. Preferred localization are dependent lung segments, most often on the right side. For bacteriological examination in these infections, only transtracheal aspirate and aspirate from the lung or pleural space are considered adequate. In 26 cases of empyema treated in our hospital during the last 3 years, adequate specimens had been taken in 19. Fifteen had been adequately examined, and anaerobes were cultured in 6. Among 29 abscesses treated during the same period, adequate specimens had been taken in only 14, and 11 had been properly examined. Seven specimens grew anaerobes on culture. In prospective studies of transtracheal aspirate in 15 chronic bronchitics without emphysema, anaerobes were not demonstrated. In 11 patients with bronchiectasis, anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 3. Finally, no anaerobic bacteria could be demonstrated in the transtracheal aspirate from 76 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Anaerobic, pulmonary infections do not represent an intriguing medical problem in our region.

In this debilitated population, gram-negative bacillary pneumonias (GNBP) are increasingly common. GNBP account for two of every three pneumonia deaths today. As a group, the mortality of GNBP is about 50%. Although the original epidemiologic surveys were done 15 years ago, there is little evidence for an improving case fatality rate despite the appearance of aminoglycoside antibiotics, carbenicillin, and cephalosporins. In susceptible patients, GNBP pneumonias occur both in the community and as nosocomial infections. Recognition of the dangers of contaminated reservoir nebulizers or other similar devices used in inhalation therapy has led to epidemiologic measures within hospitals that have markedly decreased the incidence of this nosocomial GNBP. The role of Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum and similar examinations of specimens obtained by transtracheal aspiration, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and lung biopsy in the diagnosis of GNBP are discussed in this review (see Criteria for Diagnosis). In the presence of pulmonary emphysema, congestive heart failure, mixed gram-negative bacillary infections, or the use of immunosuppressive drugs, typical characteristics of individual GNBP may not be apparent. Typical features of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Proteus, Hemophilus, and anaerobic pulmonary infections are described. Early recognition and institution of appropriate antibacterial agents are emphasized, particularly in GNBP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Friedlander's bacillus, where the mortality approaches 70%. The mortality of GNBP, including Enterobacter, Proteus, Hemophilus, and anaerobic GNBP, is about 20%. The latter figure is the same as the mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia in similar patients."

They included 160 (32%) Pr. melaninogenica, 105 (21%) Pr. intermedia, 84 (17%) P. asaccharolytica, 58 (12%) Pr. orisbuccae, and 58 (12%) Pr. oralis. Most Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). Predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). The micro-organisms most commonly isolated with Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (108), Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (95), Escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). Most Bacteroides spp. and E. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most Fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. beta-Lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. All patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. Four patients died from their infection. These data illustrate the spectrum and importance of Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in infections in children."

Most patients had an indolent infection with tissue necrosis (abscess or bronchopulmonary fistula) at initial presentation. Nevertheless, many had a more fulminant disease course resembling that of pneumococcal pneumonia. Transtracheal aspiration was the procedure most commonly used to obtain uncontaminated specimens for anaerobic culture; since this procedure now is seldom employed, pulmonary infections due to anaerobes rarely have an etiologic diagnosis at present. The dominant pathogens are Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium species. Although clindamycin is widely considered to be the antibiotic of choice, proper therapeutic trials would probably prove many antibiotics to be effective for the treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections."

","SPECIES:Fusobacterium necrophorumID:12441902TITLE:The evolution of Lemierre syndrome: report of 2 cases and review of the literature.ABSTRACT:Lemierre syndrome (postanginal septicemia) is caused by an acute oropharyngeal infection with secondary septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and frequent metastatic infections. A high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the usual etiologic agent. The disease progresses in several steps. The first stage is the primary infection, which is usually a pharyngitis (87.1% of cases). This is followed by local invasion of the lateral pharyngeal space and IJV septic thrombophlebitis (documented in 71.5% of cases), and finally, the occurrence of metastatic complications (present in 90% of cases at the time of diagnosis). A sore throat is the most common symptom during the primary infection (82.5% of cases). During invasion of the lateral pharyngeal space and IJV septic thrombophlebitis, a swollen and/or tender neck is the most common finding (52.2% of patients) and should be considered a red flag in patients with current or recent pharyngitis. The most common site of metastatic infection is the lungs (79.8% of cases). In contrast to the preantibiotic era, cavitating pneumonia and septic arthritis are now uncommon. Most patients (82.5%) had fever at some stage during the course of the disease. Gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were common (49.5% of cases). An elevated white blood cell count occurred in 75.2% of cases. Hyperbilirubinemia with slight elevation of liver enzyme levels occurred in one-third of patients, but frank jaundice was uncommon, in contrast to its high frequency reported in the preantibiotic era. We conclude that, most likely as a consequence of widespread antibiotic use for pharyngeal infections, the typical course of the disease has changed since Lemierre's original description. The typical triad in our series was: pharyngitis, a tender/swollen neck, and noncavitating pulmonary infiltrates. The previous classical description of severe sepsis with cavitating pneumonia and septic arthritis was not commonly seen in our review. Mortality was low in our series (6.4%), but significant morbidity occurred, which was likely preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. The pathophysiology, natural history, diagnostic methods for internal jugular vein thrombosis, and management are discussed."

In Norway, 11,495 hospitalized days were recorded for acute infections (influenza and pneumonia excluded) in the upper airways in 2008. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by both 1): symptoms of nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, and/or facial pain/pressure and 2): endoscopic signs of mucopurulent discharge from middle meatus and/or CT changes within the osteomeatal complex/sinuses. After 12 weeks of symptoms the definition changes to chronic rhinosinusitis. With antibiotic treatment of complicated ABRS we see fewer severe complications, but they still occur. Due to anatomical proximity of the orbit and intracranial structures a localized spread of the infection is especially unfortunate and potentially dangerous.

Upper respiratory tract infection is the most common antecedent. We report a case of Lemierre syndrome as a rare infectious disease. A 20-year-old man complained of high fever, right neck discomfort and chest pain. Chest X-ray revealed infiltrative shadows, suggesting bacterial pneumonia. Although cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate (CFPN-PI) was given in a local clinic, his symptoms did not improve. Then he was referred to our hospital. Chest CT findings showed bilateral multiple nodular shadows with small cavities, suggesting septic embolization. Fusobacterium necrophorum was cultured from specimen of the blood, and an enhanced neck CT scan showed thrombosis in the right internal jugular vein.

Systemic infections due to F.necrophorum are known as Lemierre's syndrome, postanginal sepsis or necrobacillosis. The most common clinical course of severe infections in humans is a progressive illness from tonsillitis to septicemia in previously healthy young adults. A septic thrombophlebitis arising from the tonsillar veins and extending into the internal jugular vein leads to septicemia and septic emboli contributing to the development of necrotic abscesses especially in lungs and other tissues such as liver, bone and joints. In this case report, a previously healthy man with pneumonia and empyema due to F.necrophorum has been presented. A 22 year-old man suffering from sore throat for seven days was admitted to emergency department with ongoing fever and dysphagia for three days. On admission he was already taking amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and his complaints were relieved with continuation of therapy to a total of 10 days. However, five days after the cessation of treatment he developed productive cough, fever and generalized myalgia. On physical examination, there were crackles on right lower lung, and chest X-ray revealed pulmonary consolidation on the right middle lobe. Levofloxacin therapy was started based on the diagnosis of pneumonia. While polymorphonuclear leucocytes and intracellular gram-negative bacilli were seen in Gram stained sputum smear, sputum culture was reported as normal flora. Although the patient's status had started to improve with treatment, his condition deteriorated with development of fever and dyspnea. Chest X-ray revealed consolidation, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion and air-fluid level on the right. Meropenem, clarithromycin and linezolid were initiated and a chest tube was inserted with the preliminary diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia, empyema and type-1 respiratory failure. While there was no growth on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture, thoracentesis material inoculated into thioglycolate broth revealed turbidity. Further inoculation onto Schaedler agar which was incubated under anaerobic conditions, yielded growth of catalase negative, indol positive, gram-negative anaerobic bacilli identified as F.necrophorum by BBL Crystal system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The detailed history of the patient revealed that fish bone had stuck in his throat a week ago. Clarithromycin and linezolid were discontinued and he was recovered within six weeks of meropenem treatment. F.necrophorum infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent head and neck infections with rapidly progressive metastatic necrotic lesions especially in healthy young adults and clindamycin or metranidazol should be added to the treatment protocols."

Since the introduction of antibiotics, the morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome have been dramatically reduced. This syndrome is characterized by a pharyngeal infection, which leads to the development of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with septic emboli, which usually spread into the lung. Sometimes the syndrome can be revealed by other unusual clinical symptoms. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a young patient with an atypical pleural infection associated with pharyngeal infection and thrombosis from the internal jugular vein. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome is mainly clinical, based on a range of suggesting symptoms. Confirmation and monitoring of the condition can be done by ultra-sound and/or contrast enhanced computed tomography. Treatment is based on long-term, high-dose antibiotic therapy and eventually surgical drainage of the infected collection with surgical excision of the internal jugular vein where there is extensive thrombosis. The important message is that in the context of a young patient without comorbidity, who presents with a significant infectious pleurisy, it is important to consider this clinical complication."

Evidence-based management includes early administration of empiric antibiotics against plausible bacterial pathogens while awaiting results of microbiologic cultures. However, in over 60% of pneumonia cases, no causative pathogen is identified with conventional diagnostic techniques. In this case report, we demonstrate how direct-from-sample sequencing of bacterial DNA could have identified the multiple culprit pathogens early in the disease course to guide appropriate antibiotic management. CASE REPORT A previously healthy, 21-year-old man presented with neck pain and fever and rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was found to have septic thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome), with blood cultures growing Fusobacterium necrophorum. While his antibiotics were narrowed to piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy, his clinical condition worsened, but repeated efforts to define an additional/alternative respiratory pathogen resulted in negative cultures. He eventually developed bilateral empyemas growing Mycoplasma hominis. Once azithromycin was added to the patient's regimen, he improved dramatically. Retrospective sequencing of consecutive endotracheal aspirates showed Fusobacterium as the dominant pathogen early in the course, but with significant and increasing Mycoplasma abundance several days prior to clinical detection. CONCLUSIONS Had sequencing information been available to the treating clinicians, the causative pathogens could have been detected earlier, guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy and perhaps preventing his clinical complications. Real-time bacterial DNA sequencing has the potential to shift the diagnostic paradigm in severe pneumonia."

It begins with an oropharyngeal infection, which spreads locally to involve the internal jugular vein causing thrombophlebitis, followed by distant spread and metastatic infections. Affected individuals are commonly young adults. Causative organisms are usually oropharyngeal flora, most commonly being the anaerobe Fusobacterium necrophorum. Porphyromonas asaccharolytica is a rare etiological agent with only three cases being reported in the literature. This case report describes a previously healthy 22-year-old man who initially presented with acute tonsillitis and was later found to have left internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis along with bilateral septic emboli to the lungs. The patient was treated with a five-week course of ampicillin-sulbactam and metronidazole. Subsequent imaging also showed progression of internal jugular vein thrombus, for which warfarin was given for three months for anticoagulation."

It is characterized by infection involving the posterior compartment of the lateral pharyngeal space complicated by septic suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with F. necrophorum bacteremia and metastatic abscesses, primarily to the lung and pulmonary septic emboli. Herein, we present a very rare case of oropharyngeal infection complicated by Lemierre's syndrome with characteristic septic emboli to the lungs presenting as sore throat in a previously healthy patient. A 23-year-old woman presented with sore throat and was found to be in sepsis and acute kidney injury. She was found to have septic emboli in lung and Streptococcus anginosus and F. necrophorum in blood. She was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome and successfully treated with antibiotics. Lemierre's syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis in young patients who deteriorate in the setting of a sore throat. If the suspicion is high, throat swabs from young patients with nonstreptococcal group A tonsillitis should be cultured anaerobically on selective medium to detect the presence of F. necrophorum. While clinicians of the infectious disease team may be familiar with this condition other departments including internal medicine and critical care team may less so. Unless clinicians are aware of this syndrome, diagnosis and treatment can be delayed leading to higher morbidity and mortality."

We initiated treatment with vasopressors, an antibacterial agent, immunoglobulins as well as an appropriate ventilator management; however, his unstable circulatory condition continued. As soon as PMX-DHP was initiated, 2 days following admission to the ICU, his circulatory instability normalized. F. necrophorum was ultimately detected after a culture examination, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a jugular vein thrombus, which led to the diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome.

However, unusual forms of the disorder have been rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an unusual case of a previously healthy 58-year-old male with Lemierre's syndrome, manifesting with lumbar pain and fever. A thrombosis of the iliac veins and abscesses in the right iliac and the left psoas muscles was diagnosed by a computed tomography scan, together with a right lung pneumonia complicated by pleural effusion and an L4-L5 spondylodiscitis. Blood culture and pus drainage were positive for Fusobacterium nucleatum and an atypical Lemierre's syndrome was suspected. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy for 12 weeks and intravenous antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks with a good evolution and resolution of the thrombosis.

However, it is not well known that Fusobacterium necrophorum infection can have a clinical picture similar to that of leptospirosis. A 38-year-old man was admitted with jaundice, conjunctival hyperemia, and AKI for 7 days. Chest CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules, atypical for leptospirosis. We started treatment with IV piperacillin-tazobactam and minocycline. He became anuric and was urgently started on hemodialysis on the second hospital day. Later on, blood cultures grew Fusobacterium necrophorum and other anaerobic bacteria. Antibody and PCR assays for Leptospira were negative. We narrowed the antibiotics to IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole. He responded well to the treatment and was discharged on the 18th hospital day. F. necrophorum infection is known to cause mixed infection with other anaerobic bacteria. The resistance of many anaerobic bacteria continues to progress, and F. necrophorum itself sometimes produces beta-lactamase.

Case presentation: A 70-year-old female with retropharyngeal abscess developed features of Lemierre syndrome. The condition was managed with serial aspiration of the abscess and prolonged usage of intravenous antibiotics. Discussion: Lemierre syndrome is most frequently caused by the anaerobic bacterium, Fusobacterium necrophorum. Although rare, there is evidence of a resurgence in the condition in recent years, most probably due to reduced use of antibiotic therapy for sore throats. Although there is a characteristic clinical picture, many clinicians are unaware of this condition, leading to delayed diagnosis with potentially fatal consequences. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of this condition and prompt treatment with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics results in a complete resolution of this condition. Surgery is indicated in the case of abscess formation."

Blood cultures obtained before the administration of empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics had positive results for the growth of Fusobacterium necrophorum The pathogen is an uncommon but well-known cause of anaerobic pneumonia with unique features that are collectively referred to as Lemierre syndrome or postanginal sepsis. The syndrome begins as a pharyngeal infection. Untreated, the infection progresses to involve the ipsilateral internal jugular vein, resulting in septic thrombophlebitis with direct spread from the neck to the lungs causing multifocal necrotizing pneumonia. The teenager we present in this report had neither a preceding pharyngeal infection nor Doppler ultrasonographic evidence for the presence of deep neck vein thrombi, leading us to explore alternative mechanisms for her pneumonia. We propose the possibility that her behavior of frequent vaping led to sufficient pharyngeal irritation such that F necrophorum colonizing her oropharynx was inhaled directly into her lungs during electronic cigarette use. Preexisting, but not yet recognized, vaping-related lung injury may have also contributed to her risk of developing the infection. The patient was hospitalized for 10 days.

Modern physicians have ""forgotten"" this disease. The most common causative agent of Lemierre's syndrome is Fusobacterium necrophorum, followed by Fusobacterium nucleatum and anaerobic bacteria such as streptococci, staphylococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The causative focus mostly originated from pharyngitis or tonsillitis, accounting for over 85% of the cases of Lemierre's syndrome. Pneumonia or pleural empyema is the most common metastatic infection in Lemierre's syndrome. Antimicrobial therapy should be prescribed for 3-6 weeks. The treatment regimens include metronidazole and beta-lactam antibiotics. In recent years, the antibiotic stewardship program has resulted in decreased antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory tract infections. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome has increased over the past decade. F. necrophorum is an underestimated cause of acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

Ten patients (30 %) had nosocomial pneumonia, 8 of whom had at least one identical strain in both lung and sinus cultures, including 2 patients with anaerobic bacteria isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Using appropriate microbiological techniques, anaerobic bacteria were frequently isolated in nosocomial sinusitis. If necessary, the empirical choice of antimicrobial therapy in patients with nosocomial sinusitis should take into account these results."

","SPECIES:Fusobacterium nucleatumID:10983929TITLE:Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections.ABSTRACT:Anaerobic organisms play a major role in pleuropulmonary infections. Clinical manifestations range from simple aspiration to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonias to chronic infections, such as lung abscess and empyema. Implicated pathogens are usually of endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections is based on recovering the etiological agent from clinical specimens. Appropriate specimens include pleuml fluid, transtracheal aspirates, transthoracic aspirates and fiberoptic bronchoscopic aspirates. Collection and transport of uncontaminated specimens is crucial to the recovery of the causative agents. Evaluation of a Gram's stain of clinical material provides a guide to initial therapy. Pigmented and non-pigmented Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus species, and Bacteriodes species are the most commonly recovered anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections. Successful treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections requires a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical interventions. Routine susceptibility testing of recovered isolates is rarely warranted."

To identify the clinical characteristics and outcomes, we conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized patients from January 2004 to December 2009 at a tertiary center in northern Taiwan. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 58.1 years, and the mean Pitt bacteremia score was 4.7. Males predominated (59.6%), and the overall 30-day mortality rate was up to 47.4%. Malignancy was the major comorbidity (26/57, 45.6%), especially oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal cancers (19/26, 73.1%). Pneumonia (17/57, 29.8%) was the most common presentation with high rates of respiratory failure (15/17, 88.2%) and mortality (11/17, 64.7%), followed by intra-abdominal infections (7/57, 12.3%). In multivariate analysis, higher Pitt bacteremia score, nosocomial infection, anemia, and intensive care unit stay were the independent factors for 30-day mortality. Nosocomial F. nucleatum bacteremia was a significant mortality predictor independent to other parameters of disease severities."

However, unusual forms of the disorder have been rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an unusual case of a previously healthy 58-year-old male with Lemierre's syndrome, manifesting with lumbar pain and fever. A thrombosis of the iliac veins and abscesses in the right iliac and the left psoas muscles was diagnosed by a computed tomography scan, together with a right lung pneumonia complicated by pleural effusion and an L4-L5 spondylodiscitis. Blood culture and pus drainage were positive for Fusobacterium nucleatum and an atypical Lemierre's syndrome was suspected. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy for 12 weeks and intravenous antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks with a good evolution and resolution of the thrombosis.

Modern physicians have ""forgotten"" this disease. The most common causative agent of Lemierre's syndrome is Fusobacterium necrophorum, followed by Fusobacterium nucleatum and anaerobic bacteria such as streptococci, staphylococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The causative focus mostly originated from pharyngitis or tonsillitis, accounting for over 85% of the cases of Lemierre's syndrome. Pneumonia or pleural empyema is the most common metastatic infection in Lemierre's syndrome. Antimicrobial therapy should be prescribed for 3-6 weeks. The treatment regimens include metronidazole and beta-lactam antibiotics. In recent years, the antibiotic stewardship program has resulted in decreased antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory tract infections. The incidence of Lemierre's syndrome has increased over the past decade. F. necrophorum is an underestimated cause of acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis. A high index of suspicion is required for the differential diagnosis of acute tonsillopharyngitis with persistent neck pain and septic syndrome."

","SPECIES:Fusobacterium nucleatumID:37594TITLE:Anaerobic pulmonary infections.ABSTRACT:The main cause of anaerobic pulmonary infections is aspiration of saliva, upper airway secretions or gastric content. Predisposing conditions include prominent dental disease, chronic upper respiratory tract infections and reduced consciousness. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci are the most frequently encountered organisms. The clinical presentations are lung abscess, lung gangrene and empyema, which all tend to take a slow and indolent course. Preferred localization are dependent lung segments, most often on the right side. For bacteriological examination in these infections, only transtracheal aspirate and aspirate from the lung or pleural space are considered adequate. In 26 cases of empyema treated in our hospital during the last 3 years, adequate specimens had been taken in 19. Fifteen had been adequately examined, and anaerobes were cultured in 6. Among 29 abscesses treated during the same period, adequate specimens had been taken in only 14, and 11 had been properly examined. Seven specimens grew anaerobes on culture. In prospective studies of transtracheal aspirate in 15 chronic bronchitics without emphysema, anaerobes were not demonstrated. In 11 patients with bronchiectasis, anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 3. Finally, no anaerobic bacteria could be demonstrated in the transtracheal aspirate from 76 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Anaerobic, pulmonary infections do not represent an intriguing medical problem in our region. However, knowledge of these infections is necessary to secure adequacy in collection of specimens and in their bacteriological examination."

We particularly took care to preserve anaerobic conditions during transport and the microbiological procedure. Two groups were considered: group A with anaerobic bacteria recovered from PSB, with or without anaerobes, and group B with aerobic bacteria only. One hundred and thirty patients were included, 30 (23%) in group A, and 100 (77%) in group B. The main anaerobic strains isolated were Prevotella melaninogenica (36%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), and Veillonella parvula (12%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients in group A were younger than those in group B (p &lt; 0.05) and their simplified acute physiologic score was higher (p &lt; 0.02). The percentage of patients receiving antibiotics before PSB did not differ significantly between group A (57%) and group B (35%).

Prior studies suggest that probiotics may reduce VAP and other infections in critically ill patients; however, most previous randomised trials were small, single centre studies. The Probiotics: Prevention of Severe Pneumonia and Endotracheal Colonization Trial (PROSPECT) aims to determine the impact of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on VAP and other clinically important outcomes in critically ill adults. METHODS: PROSPECT is a multicentre, concealed, randomised, stratified, blinded, controlled trial in patients &gt;=18 years old, anticipated to be mechanically ventilated &gt;=72 hours, in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada, the USA and Saudi Arabia. Patients receive either 1x1010 colony forming units of L. rhamnosus GG twice daily or an identical appearing placebo. Those at increased risk of probiotic infection are excluded. The primary outcome is VAP. Secondary outcomes are other ICU-acquired infections including Clostridioides difficile infection, diarrhoea (including antibiotic-associated diarrhoea), antimicrobial use, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. The planned sample size of 2650 patients is based on an estimated 15% VAP rate and will provide 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol and statistical analysis plan outlines the methodology, primary and secondary analyses, sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses. PROSPECT is approved by Health Canada (#9427-M1133-45C), the research ethics boards of all participating hospitals and Public Health Ontario. Results will be disseminated via academic channels (peer reviewed journal publications, professional healthcare fora including international conferences) and conventional and social media.

He was later noted to have multiple bilateral subpleural pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography scan. After admission, Parvimonas micra (P. micra) was isolated from his blood culture. This was followed by a meticulous search for the primary source of SPE, focusing on the head and neck areas. Consequently, apical periodontitis and infratemporal fossa abscess were identified as the primary sources of SPE. Although P. micra is one of the most frequently detected bacteria in the infected root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis, it has rarely been proven as a causative pathogen of periodontal disease-associated SPE. CONCLUSIONS: This case study demonstrated that periodontal disease is an important primary source of SPE and P. micra could be a causative pathogen of SPE."

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old male patient visited the emergency room with a complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath, and he developed acute respiratory failure rapidly. DIAGNOSIS: An abscess in the left lower lung field was diagnosed on the computed tomography scan of chest. INTERVENTIONS: Immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics was initiated along with a pigtail catheter insertion for pus drainage. OUTCOMES: A odontolyticus was cultured on the drained pus and P micra was identified by a blood culture. The patient was successfully weaned from the mechanical ventilator and the lung abscess was completely resolved. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of mixed infection with A odontolyticus and P micra, which caused acute respiratory failure in an immune-competent patient. Therefore, physicians should consider the possibility of these organisms as causative pathogens of a fulminant pulmonary infection even in an immune-competent patient."

Imaging to differentiate abscess from other entities is often non-diagnostic, and often the source of infection is unknown. We present an unusual case of peritumoral abscess infected with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: A 70-year-old, previously healthy male presented with a 1-day history of right-sided facial weakness sparing the forehead, as well as concomitant right upper and lower extremity numbness. A homogenously enhancing mass with adjacent rim-enhancing lesion with diffusion restricting cavity seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) raised the possibility of abscess. RESULTS: Separate biopsy specimens of both the tumor and adjacent fluid collection during drainage of the collection confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma and bacterial abscess containing Streptococcus constellatus, Fusobacterium species, Prevotella dentalis, and Parvimonas micra. The histologic diagnosis therefore confirmed the preoperative radiologic findings of two different but associated lesions. Investigations to determine a definitive source of infection were inconclusive, including urinalysis, blood cultures, respiratory cultures, endoscopy, and an orthopantomogram. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can both be culprits in the formation of peritumoral abscess. Although the source of infection is unconfirmed, the presence of oropharyngeal flora in the abscess suggests a subclinical odontogenic infection with hematogenous spread to the tumor and adjacent brain."

Infections associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody therapy include tuberculosis, viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Likewise, severe infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, lung, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, joint, and bone have also been reported previously. However, infections involving the central nervous system are rare, especially an intracranial infection caused by odontogenic infection. To date, only few cases have been reported of this infection. This is the first case of a patient with psoriatic arthritis receiving adalimumab and developing brain abscess of odontogenic origin. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old male with psoriatic arthritis receiving adalimumab treatment came to the emergency department with initial presentation of sudden onset convulsions. He had been receiving adalimumab treatment for 1 month. Two days after the third injection, the patient had an episode of sudden-onset general convulsion for nearly 5 min with the upgazing and general tonic presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed left frontal lobe brain abscess. Pus culture from the brain abscess detected Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), and Parvimonas micra (P. micra). DIAGNOSIS: Brain abscess with odontogenic infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received left frontal craniotomy, abscess drainage and systemic empiric antibiotics treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Due to drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms during the treatment, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and systemic antibiotics were switched to teicoplanin and ceftriaxone. OUTCOMES: A brain MRI follow-up performed after 1 month of initial treatment revealed the reduced size of the abscess lesion and minimal oedema. The patient was discharged with stable condition. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with psoriatic arthritis receiving adalimumab and developing brain abscess of odontogenic origin. Such a rare diagnosis must be kept in mind when patients treated with adalimumab present with sudden-onset convulsions. Careful dental examination should be performed before administration of adalimumab."

In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed GPA bacteremia pathogens before (2013-2015) and after (2016-2018) the introduction of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). METHOD: We conducted a retrospective observational study by searching the microbiology database to identify all positive GPA blood cultures of patients with GPA bacteremia diagnosed using the new technique, MALDI-TOF MS, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018; and using a conventional phenotypic method between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015 at a single tertiary center in Japan. Parvimonas micra (P. micra) (17.5%) was the second most frequently identified GPA (MALDI-TOF MS); we then retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records for 25 P. micra bacteremia cases at our hospital. We also conducted a literature review of published cases in PubMed from January 1, 1980, until December 31, 2019; 27 cases were retrieved. RESULTS: Most cases of P. micra bacteremia were identified after 2015, both, at our institute and from the literature review. They were of mostly elderly patients and had comorbid conditions (malignancies and diabetes). In our cases, laryngeal pharynx (7/25, 28%) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT; 6/25, 24%) were identified as the most likely sources of bacteremia; however, the infection source was not identified in 9 cases (36%). P. micra bacteremia were frequently associated with spondylodiscitis (29.6%), oropharyngeal infection (25.9%), intra-abdominal abscess (14.8%), infective endocarditis (11.1%), septic pulmonary emboli (11.1%), and GIT infection (11.1%) in the literature review. Almost all cases were treated successfully with antibiotics and by abscess drainage. The 30-day mortalities were 4 and 3.7% for our cases and the literature cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Infection sites of P. micra are predominantly associated with GIT, oropharyngeal, vertebral spine, intra-abdominal region, pulmonary, and heart valves. Patients with P. micra bacteremia could have good prognosis following appropriate treatment."

Some anaerobe was isolated in 42 (10.9%) in 387 patients whom we performed transtracheal aspiration (TTA), in 42 (15.7%) of 268 in whom some organism was isolated from TTA, or in 42 (16.3%) of 257 patients in whom some bacterium excluding acid-fast bacteria, fungi or mycoplasma from TTA. The isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was 93.3% in the patients with lung abscess, 22.7% in the patients with nosocomial pneumonia, 19.4% in the patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 26.7% in the patients with acute exacerbation of chronic lower respiratory tract infection (CLRTI), 1.6% in the patients with persistent infection of CLRTI, and 3.0% in the patients with acute bronchitis, respectively. The major anaerobes, isolated from TTA, were Peptostreptococcus micros and Prevotella melaninogenica. The aerobic bacteria were isolated with anaerobic bacteria in 32 of 42 patients at the same time. The quantitive grade of colonial growth of anaerobes was equal to or more than aerobes in the patients with lung abscess and pneumonia. We mostly administrated 3rd generation cephems or carbapenems with or without clindamycin for the treatment of anaerobic infections. Forty-one of 42 patients were cured only by the therapy of antimicrobial agents, but pneumonia patient with lung cancer died in spite of adequate antimicrobial therapy.

Clinical manifestations range from simple aspiration to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonias to chronic infections, such as lung abscess and empyema. Implicated pathogens are usually of endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections is based on recovering the etiological agent from clinical specimens. Appropriate specimens include pleuml fluid, transtracheal aspirates, transthoracic aspirates and fiberoptic bronchoscopic aspirates. Collection and transport of uncontaminated specimens is crucial to the recovery of the causative agents. Evaluation of a Gram's stain of clinical material provides a guide to initial therapy. Pigmented and non-pigmented Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus species, and Bacteriodes species are the most commonly recovered anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections. Successful treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections requires a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical interventions.

He had severe neck contracture deviated to the left side which resulted in dysphagia and microaspiration. At 29 years of age, he developed left lobar pneumonia accompanied by slight fever, back pain and a foul odor from the patient's sputum. Although the patient received broad spectrum antibiotics, pneumonia disseminated to the right lung. A week later, chest computed tomography was conducted which revealed tracheopulmonary-subcutaneous fistula, and a massive subcutaneous abscess with free air production. Drainage from the subcutaneous abscess was done through a chest tube; however, respiratory hypercapnia was not corrected and the patient died. From the culture of drained fluid, anaerobic bacteria including peptostreptococcus sp. were detected. This tracheopulmonary-subcutaneous fistula was thought to be caused by chronic microaspiration of mouth anaerobes, mechanical injury of the trachea under long term ventilator support, and decreased deep back muscle bulk with substitution of adipose tissue around the chest."

Cases of TB or atypical micobacterial infection were excluded from this analysis. Causative organisms were identified, when possible, by taking into account positive cultures from diverse sources (blood, sputum, pleural fluid and others). Results: In the 6-yr period we considered, 120 patients were identified. Among them, we were able to obtain clinical and imaging data on 98 cases. Focal infiltrates on chest X-ray studies were present in 87.7% of cases, 24.5% had a pleural effusion, 9.2% nodular lesions, 4.1% cavitary images and in 2 patients only hilar lymphadenopaties were noted. Causative agents resulted to be S. aureus (14 cases); P. aeruginosa (11); S. pneumoniae (6); R. equi (4); Enterobacter spp. and K. pneumoniae (3 cases each); E. coli, Peptostreptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp. (1 case each). No causative organism was isolated in 54 patients (55.1%) and the diagnosis was based on clinical and therapeutical grounds. Around half of cases (46.9%) responded well to therapy, while 11 (11.2%) died because of the lung infection. In 3 cases other opportunistic infections were the cause of death and 22 cases of relapse were recorded as well. Five patients resulted lost to follow-up. Conclusions: This retrospective study demonstrated a high prevalence of S. aureus lung infections along with the presence of otherwise rare causative organisms such as R. equi. Radiologic appearance of lung lesions did not differ substantially from the one of HIV negative patients. A relatively good response to antibiotic therapy was also noted."

In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the anaerobic bacteria which can cause aspiration pneumonia, Fusobacterium spp., Finegoldia magna, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Streptococcus milleri group to ceftriaxone, cefmetazole, flomoxef, ampicillin/sulbactam, and ampicillin. We also tested the beta-lactamase activities of each of the bacterial strains. Fusobacterium spp. and Finegoldia magna were susceptible to all of the tested antimicrobial drugs, except ampicillin, and showed no beta-lactamase activity. The Streptococcus milleri group, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. showed decreased susceptibility to cefmetazole or flomoxef as compared to the susceptibility levels documented in a previous report. There was one strain of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius which was not susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam, but also showed no beta-lactamase activity, suggesting that this strain harbored a mechanism of resistance other than the production of beta-lactamase. The susceptibility of Prevotella spp. to ceftriaxone was also decreased as compared to the susceptibility level documented in a previous report. Furthermore, beta-lactamase-positive strains were found even among ceftriaxone-susceptible strains. Elderly persons with swallowing dysfunction carry a risk of recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia and repeated use of antibiotics increases the risk of development of antibiotic resistance. In the present study, the antibiotic susceptibilities of some of organisms which can cause aspiration pneumonia were found to be decreased as compared to the susceptibility levels documented in a previous report. Therefore, surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these bacteria is recommended to prevent the development of resistance."

Leading pathogens in more than 90% are anaerobic bacteria, mostly species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus; aerobic bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, mainly Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment depends on bacteriological results; penicillin G and clindamycin are the most useful antibiotics against anaerobes and should be administered over a long period of time (4-12 weeks), adjusted to the clinical course of the individual patient."

Studies of transtracheal aspirates and pleural fluid.ABSTRACT:A prospective study of bacteriology in 14 cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema is reported. Bacteriologic results were based on transtracheal aspirates or pleural fluid. Appropriate anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 11 patients (79%); they were the only pathogens isolated in 6 patients. The predominant species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Aerobic bacteria were present in 7 patients. The results indicate that anaerobes play a key role in most cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema, and that proper culture of adequat specimens will generally establish the bacteriological diagnosis."

Various studies of a total of 420 patients treated with piperacillin for lower respiratory tract infections found that 97% of the patients were cured or markedly improved. Piperacillin has also been found as effective as combination therapy (gentamicin or tobramycin plus carbenicillin or ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious infections, including pneumonia and several caused by gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms. A review of the literature on bacteriological responses to piperacillin shows that 126 of 153 (82%) of the susceptible strains could be eradicated. Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp have been completely eradicated by treatment with piperacillin.

Anaerobes were isolated in 80% of pyothorax, 43% of lung abscess, and 15% of pneumonia (42% of aspiration pneumonia), respectively. Anaerobes isolated frequently in respiratory infections included Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. In regard to the type of specimen, bronchial aspirate obtained by bronchoscopy was useful in examination of pneumonia, and was useful as percutaneous lung aspirate in examination of lung abscess. But there was discrepancy of culture results between specimens obtained by different methods in the same patient. To confirm anaerobes as pathogens in respiratory infections, it is necessary to select an appropriate method to obtain specimens and to interpret the culture results comprehensively."

Most patients had an indolent infection with tissue necrosis (abscess or bronchopulmonary fistula) at initial presentation. Nevertheless, many had a more fulminant disease course resembling that of pneumococcal pneumonia. Transtracheal aspiration was the procedure most commonly used to obtain uncontaminated specimens for anaerobic culture; since this procedure now is seldom employed, pulmonary infections due to anaerobes rarely have an etiologic diagnosis at present. The dominant pathogens are Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium species.

Both dentate and edentulous patients showed similar ET bacterial levels. Dentate patients showed no correlation between oral and ET bacterial levels, while edentulous patients showed positive correlations between oral and ET levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia. Periodontal pathogens can colonize ET and the oral cavity of ICU patients. Periodontal pathogen profiles tend to be similar between dentate and edentulous ICU patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The population study included 53 intensive care unit patients with nosocomial pneumonia in whom, using a protected specimen brush, anaerobic bacteria were isolated, which were associated or not with aerobes. Current and empirical antibiotherapies were retrospectively analyzed, regarding their efficacy against anaerobic bacteria. Since it was debated, sensitivity to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin was determined in 38 strains of Prevotella species. Outcome was evaluated 10 days after the day of protected specimen brushes. Improvement was defined as a decrease of Murray score or ventilator weaning. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated bacteria were Prevotella species, which were more frequently resistant to cefotaxime (37%), ceftazidime (50%), and ciprofloxacine (32%) than usually reported in the literature. Sixty-six percent of these strains produced beta-lactamase. The effect of empirical anti-anaerobic antibiotherapy on the outcome at day 10 was evaluable in 39 patients. Twenty-nine patients were improved and 10 patients worsened. Interestingly, patients who had received well-adapted antibiotics against anaerobes had a better outcome after 10 days (P &lt; .02).

Clinical manifestations range from simple aspiration to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonias to chronic infections, such as lung abscess and empyema. Implicated pathogens are usually of endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections is based on recovering the etiological agent from clinical specimens. Appropriate specimens include pleuml fluid, transtracheal aspirates, transthoracic aspirates and fiberoptic bronchoscopic aspirates. Collection and transport of uncontaminated specimens is crucial to the recovery of the causative agents. Evaluation of a Gram's stain of clinical material provides a guide to initial therapy. Pigmented and non-pigmented Prevotella species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus species, and Bacteriodes species are the most commonly recovered anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections.

Data collection included demographic information, Activity of Daily Living, Plaque Index, antimicrobial therapy, and outcome. Out of the 67 pathogens identified, Gram-negative enteric bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (49%), followed by anaerobic bacteria (16%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12%). The most commonly encountered anaerobes were Prevotella and Fusobacterium species. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli were recovered in conjunction with 55% of anaerobic isolates. The Plaque Index did not differ significantly between the aerobic (2.2 +/- 0.4) and the anaerobic group (2.3 +/- 0.3). Functional status was the only determinant of the presence of anaerobic bacteria. Although seven cases with anaerobic isolates received initially inadequate antimicrobial therapy, six had effective clinical response. The crude mortality was 33% for the aerobic and 36% for the anaerobic group (p = 0.9). Stepwise multivariate analysis identified hypoalbuminemia (p &lt; 0.001) and the burden of comorbid diseases (p &lt; 0.001) as independent risk factors of poor outcome. In view of the rising resistance to antimicrobial agents, the importance of adding anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia in institutionalized elders needs to be reexamined."

They are involved in infections such as pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess and empyema. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic infections is based on recovering the etiological agents from clinical materials. Appropriatte specimens include: pus, purulent fluid, biopsy specimen of lung, transtracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Lower respiratory infections are usually either polymicrobial or mixed anaerobic-aerobic infections. Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Prevotella and Bacteroides are the most common anaerobes. Anaerobic bacteria are susceptible to metronidazole, tinidazole (exception of Gram-positive rods), amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and clindamycin. Treatment includes an antibiotics regimen with an agent active against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (therapy with 2 or 3 antimicrobial drugs)."

We report a patient with empyema due to Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus who developed the syndrome. Eight hours before the start of therapy, his serum sodium concentration was 127 mEq per liter; serum osmolality, 255 mOsm per kg; urine osmolality, 522 mOsm per kg; urinary sodium concentration, 39 mEq per liter. The creatinine clearance and the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test were normal, and there was no evidence of dehydration. No other causes of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone were apparent. With drainage and antimicrobial drug therapy, the empyema cleared, and the syndrome resolved in 8 days. The patient has been well, without evidence of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, for 9 months. Anaerobic infections and/or empyema without pneumonia can be associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone."

Available data vary considerably with regard to bacteriology, role of anaerobic bacteria, and antibiotic treatment. Our objective was to research the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia in acute coma patients who were not pre-treated with antibiotics or hospitalized within 30 days prior to the event. We prospectively analyzed 127 patient records from adult patients admitted, intubated and ventilated to a tertiary medical intensive care unit with acute coma. Bacteriology and antibiotic resistance testing from tracheal aspirate sampled within 24 h after admission, blood cultures, ICU scores (APACHE II, SOFA), hematology, and clinical chemistry were assessed. Patients were followed up until death or hospital discharge. The majority of patients with acute coma suffered from acute cardiovascular disorders, predominantly myocardial infarction, followed by poisonings, and coma of unknown cause. In a majority of our patients, microaspiration resulted in overt infection. Most frequently S. aureus, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae were isolated. Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides spec., Fusobacteria, Prevotella spec.) were isolated from tracheal aspirate in a minority of patients, and predominantly as part of a mixed infection. Antibiotic monotherapy with a 2nd generation cephalosporin, or a 3rd generation gyrase inhibitor, was most effective in our patients regardless of the presence of anaerobic bacteria. "

The most common hospital-acquired infection among patients with acute respiratory failure, VAP is associated with a mortality rate of 20-30%. The standard bacterial culture method for identifying the etiology of VAP is not specific, timely, or accurate in identifying the bacterial pathogens. This study used 16S rRNA gene metagenomic sequencing to identify and quantify the pathogenic bacteria in lower respiratory tract and oropharyngeal samples of 55 VAP patients. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has served as a valuable tool in bacterial identification, particularly when other biochemical, molecular, or phenotypic identification techniques fail. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed in parallel with the standard bacterial culture method to identify and quantify bacteria present in the collected patient samples. Sequence analysis showed the colonization of multidrug-resistant strains in VAP secretions. Further, this method identified Prevotella, Proteus, Aquabacter, and Sphingomonas bacterial genera that were not detected by the standard bacterial culture method. Seven categories of bacteria, Streptococcus, Neisseria, Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, were detectable by both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and standard bacterial culture methods. Further, 16S rRNA gene sequencing had a significantly higher sensitivity in detecting Streptococcus and Pseudomonas when compared to standard bacterial culture. Together, these data present 16S rRNA gene sequencing as a novel VAP diagnosis tool that will further enable pathogen-specific treatment of VAP. "

Recent studies have uncovered whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-2019). In addition, lung metagenomic studies on infected patients revealed overrepresented Prevotella spp. producing certain proteins in abundance. We performed host-pathogen protein-protein interaction analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and overrepresented Prevotella proteins with human proteome. We also performed functional overrepresentation analysis of interacting proteins to understand their role in COVID-2019 severity. RESULTS: It was found that overexpressed Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection. As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins, are involved in multiple interactions with NF-kB, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019. Prevotella may have role in COVID-2019 outbreak and should be given importance for understanding disease mechanisms and improving treatment outcomes.

There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated..."

Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed or because of unrecognition of the pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managing in general wards. METHODS: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 h were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study. RESULTS: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood culture than patients with non-severe CAP (24% VS 4.5%; p = .008). Initial antibiotic treatment were discordant with the IDSA/ATS guidelines in 42% of all patients hospitalized with CAP, and 52% of patients with severe CAP. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and initial antibiotic treatment discordant to guidelines for severe CAP in ICU (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3-17.1) were independent risk factors of the unfavorable outcome of patients with severe CAP. Patients with unfavorable outcome had lower number of hospital-free days than patients with favorable outcome (5.2 +- 8 days VS 18 +- 7.1 days; p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes."

A secondary objective was to characterize the clonality and acquired resistance and virulence genes of MRSA. METHODS: Consecutive non-replicate isolates from HAP were collected from 13 laboratories distributed across Italy, from January to May 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution, and results were interpreted according to the EUCAST breakpoints. All MRSA isolates were subjected to WGS using an Illumina platform. Clonality and resistance and virulence gene content were investigated with bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Among 333 isolates from HAP, S. aureus was the third most common pathogen (18.6%). The proportion of MRSA was 40.3%. Susceptibility to ceftobiprole was 100% for MSSA and 95.5% for MRSA. Lower susceptibility rates of 78.4% and 94.6% in MSSA and 36.4% and 12.1% in MRSA isolates were observed for erythromycin and levofloxacin, respectively. The MRSA from HAP mostly belonged to clonal complex (CC) 22 (47.0%), CC5 (25.8%) and CC8 (15.2%), with a minority of other lineages (ST1, ST6, ST7, ST30, ST152 and ST398). Acquired resistance and virulence genes in most cases exhibited a clonal distribution. The three ceftobiprole-resistant isolates exhibited an MIC of 4 mg/L and belonged to ST228-MRSA-I of CC5. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus is an important cause of HAP in Italy. Ceftobiprole exhibited good in vitro activity against S. aureus isolated from HAP, including MRSA. A trend to replacement of ST228 with ST22 was noticed compared with previous studies."

The aim of our study was to evaluate the demography, incidence, risk factors, causative bacterial pathogens and outcome of all episodes of Hospital-acquired pneumonia in our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study, at a tertiary university hospital during one year (2014) including all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Sixty patients were identified with pneumonia. Thirty-five (58.3%) had an intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, corresponding to 6.9 cases/1000 intubation-days. Antibiotic treatment in the previous 30 days was present in 75% of the cases. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 26.2%, 20.0% and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with late-onset hospital-acquired pneumonia (>= 7 days) showed higher frequency of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolates, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Combination therapy was performed in 67.0%, and de-escalation in 18.3%. The mortality rate was 18.3%. The adjusted odds ratio for intensive care unit mortality in the group of patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia was 5.2 (95% CI of 1.02 - 22.10; p = 0.046). DISCUSSION: The knowledge of local bacterial flora and resistance patterns is of crucial importance and strongly recommended. This evidence increases the probability of success of empiric antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: S. aureus was the predominant causative agent of nosocomial pneumonia. The most frequent risk factor identified for infection with multidrug-resistant organisms was previous treatment with antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant organisms were present in 45% of documented hospital-acquired pneumonias. In admitted patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, the intensive care unit mortality rate was nearly five times higher compared to intensive care unit acquired pneumonia."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of SPE patients hospitalized between January 2007 and June 2018 in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients with SPE were identified. All patients had bilateral multiple peripheral nodules on chest computed tomography. The most common pathogen found in blood culture was Staphylococcus aureus (10/33, 30.3%). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 39 patients and 20 showed vegetations. Bronchoscopy was performed in 24 patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from 15 patients (62.5%) and showed predominantly polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (52%, range of 48%~ 63%). Four patients received transbronchial lung biopsy, and histopathological examinations revealed suppurative pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19.4%. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.100; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-1.169), hypotension (OR 7.260; 95% CI 1.126-46.804) and ineffective or delay of empirical antimicrobial therapy (OR 7.341; 95% CI 1.145-47.045) were found to be independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality, whereas drainage treatment was found to be a protective factor (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.002-0.677). CONCLUSIONS: SPE cases presented with nonspecific clinical manifestations and radiologic features. Blood cultures and bronchoscopy are important measures for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis. There is relationship between primary infection sites and the type of pathogen. Maintaining normal blood pressure and providing timely and appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy for effective control of the infection could improve prognosis."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the a) aetiology, b) factors associated with bacterial pneumonia and c) association between co-infections (bacteria + virus) and severity of disease, in children admitted with severe pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study involving children aged 1-month to 5-years admitted with very severe pneumonia, as per the WHO definition, over 2 years. Induced sputum and blood obtained within 24 hrs of admission were examined via PCR, immunofluorescence and culture to detect 17 bacteria/viruses. A designated radiologist read the chest radiographs. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with a mean (SD) age of 14 (+-15) months old were recruited. Significant pathogens were detected in 62% of patients (n = 186). Viruses alone were detected in 23.7% (n = 71) with rhinovirus (31%), human metapneumovirus (HMP) [22.5%] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16.9%] being the commonest. Bacteria alone was detected in 25% (n = 75) with Haemophilus influenzae (29.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (24%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.7%) being the commonest. Co-infections were seen in 13.3% (n = 40) of patients. Male gender (AdjOR 1.84 [95% CI 1.10, 3.05]) and presence of crepitations (AdjOR 2.27 [95% CI 1.12, 4.60]) were associated with bacterial infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) [p = 0.007]) was significantly higher in patients with co-infections but duration of hospitalization (p = 0.77) and requirement for supplemental respiratory support (p = 0.26) were not associated with co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria remain an important cause of very severe pneumonia in developing countries with one in four children admitted isolating bacteria alone. Male gender and presence of crepitations were significantly associated with bacterial aetiology. Co-infection was associated with a higher CRP but no other parameters of severe clinical illness."

The association of empirical anti-MRSA therapy with outcomes among patients with pneumonia is unknown, even for high-risk patients. Objective: To compare 30-day mortality among patients hospitalized for pneumonia receiving empirical anti-MRSA therapy vs standard empirical antibiotic regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted of all hospitalizations in which patients received either anti-MRSA or standard therapy for community-onset pneumonia in the Veterans Health Administration health care system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Subgroups of patients analyzed were those with initial intensive care unit admission, MRSA risk factors, positive results of a MRSA surveillance test, and positive results of a MRSA admission culture. Primary analysis was an inverse probability of treatment-weighted propensity score analysis using generalized estimating equation regression; secondary analyses included an instrumental variable analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 14 to November 20, 2019. Exposures: Empirical anti-MRSA therapy plus standard pneumonia therapy vs standard therapy alone within the first day of hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of 30-day all-cause mortality after adjustment for patient comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory results. Secondary outcomes included the development of kidney injury and secondary infections with Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, or gram-negative bacilli. Results: Among 88 605 hospitalized patients (86 851 men; median age, 70 years [interquartile range, 62-81 years]), empirical anti-MRSA therapy was administered to 33 632 (38%); 8929 patients (10%) died within 30 days. Compared with standard therapy alone, in weighted propensity score analysis, empirical anti-MRSA therapy plus standard therapy was significantly associated with an increased adjusted risk of death (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]), kidney injury (aRR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]), and secondary C difficile infections (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp infections (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.3]), and secondary gram-negative rod infections (aRR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]). Similar associations between anti-MRSA therapy use and 30-day mortality were found by instrumental variable analysis (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.9]) and among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (aRR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]), those with a high risk for MRSA (aRR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]), and those with MRSA detected on surveillance testing (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]). No significant favorable association was found between empirical anti-MRSA therapy and death among patients with MRSA detected on culture (aRR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.8-1.4]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that empirical anti-MRSA therapy was not associated with reduced mortality for any group of patients hospitalized for pneumonia. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that questions the value of empirical use of anti-MRSA therapy using existing risk approaches."

The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity.

We aimed to analyze medical records of children undergoing surgical treatment for PNZ and compare our results with those found in the medical literature. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of children's medical charts who underwent an operation for PNZ, between July 2006 and July 2016, in two hospitals in southern Santa Catarina, Brazil. RESULTS: A total of 26 children with a median age of 2.70 years and mostly females (61.5%) were included in the current study. The main symptoms were fever (88.5%) and cough (65.4%). There was an average use of 4.31 antibiotics per patient. The primary etiological agent was Staphylococcus aureus (23.1%), but cultures were negative in 69% of the patients. Decortication and debridement of necrotic areas were performed in 23 patients (88.5%). The mean postoperative pleural drainage was 8.12 days. The presence of bronchopleural fistula occurred in 50.0% in the preoperative period and 46.2% in the postoperative. The total length of hospital stay was, on average, 27.52 days and the postoperative length of stay was 12.60 days (mean). Postoperative complications occurred in 13 children and there was no mortality. CONCLUSION: The surgical approach is indicated to patients with no response to clinical treatment. Late surgical intervention is associated with progressive parenchyma infection and higher rates of complications. Surgery can lead to better clinical outcomes and earlier recovery."

Aim of this study was analysis of patients residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and developing pneumonia to reach a better knowledge of criteria for hospitalization and outcomes. MATERIALS/METHODS: this is a prospective, observational study in which patients residing in 3 LTCFs (metropolitan area of Rome, Italy) and developing pneumonia, hospitalized or treated in LTCF, were recruited and followed up from January 2017 to June 2019. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, secondary endpoint was analysis of risk factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: Overall, 146 episodes of NHAP were enrolled in the study: 57 patients were treated in LTCF, while 89 patients were hospitalized. Overall incidence rates of NHAP varied from 2.6 to 7.5 per 1000 residents. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (25%), and in 28 (55%) patients was documented a MDR pathogen. For hospitalized patients was reported a higher 30-day mortality (43.8% Vs 7%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that severe pneumonia, neoplasm, chronic hepatitis, antibiotic monotherapy, and malnutrition were independent risk factors for hospitalization from LTCF. MDR pathogen, severe pneumonia, COPD, and moderate to severe renal disease were independently associated with death at 30 days. CONCLUSION: frail elderly patients in LTCF have a high risk of MDR etiology with a higher risk to receive an inadequate antibiotic therapy and a fatal outcome.

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) producing MRSA has been reported to be associated with necrotizing pneumonia and worse outcome. The incidence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) pneumonia is very low, as only a few CA-MRSA pneumonia cases were reported in the last few years. We present a case of severe CAP caused by PVL-positive MRSA with ensuing septic shock. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 68-year-old male with no concerning medical history had developed a fever that reached 39.0 C, a productive cough that was sustained for 5 days, and hypodynamia. He was treated with azithromycin and alexipyretic in a nearby clinic for 2 days in which the symptoms were alleviated. However, 1 day later, the symptoms worsened, and he was taken to a local Chinese medicine hospital for traditional medicine treatment. However, his clinical condition deteriorated rapidly, and he then developed dyspnea and hemoptysis. DIAGNOSIS: CA-MRSA pneumonia and septic shock. The sputum culture showed MRSA. Polymerase chain reaction of MRSA isolates was positive for PVL genes. INTERVENTIONS: Mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic therapy were performed. Antibiotic therapy included mezlocillin sodium/sulbactam sodium, linezolid, and oseltamivir. OUTCOMES: He died after 12 hours of treatment. LESSONS: This is a report of severe pneumonia due to PVL-positive CA-MRSA in a healthy adult. CA-MRSA should be considered a pathogen of severe CAP, especially when combined with septic shock in previously healthy individuals."

SCAP is distinguished by high mortality and socio - economic burden. Both etiology and antimicrobial resistance are essential for appropriate antibiotic choice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study recruited adults with confirmed diagnosis of SCAP admitted to multi - word hospitals of six Russian cities in 2014-2018. Etiology was confirmed by routine culture of blood, respiratory (sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage) and when appropriate, autopsy samples, urinary antigen tests (L. pneumophila serogroup 1, S. pneumoniae); real - time PCR for identification of ""atypical"" bacterial pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila) and respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, etc.) was applied. RESULTS: Altogether 109 patients (60.6% male; mean age 50.8+-18.0 years old) with SCAP were enrolled. Etiological agent was identified in 65.1% of patients, S. pneumoniae, rhinovirus, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were the most commonly isolated pathogens (found in 43.7, 15.5, 14.1 and 11.3% of patients with positive results of microbiological investigations, respectively). Bacteriemia was seen in 14.6% of patients and most commonly associated with S. pneumoniae. Co - infection with 2 or more causative agents was revealed in 36.6% of cases. Combination of bacterial pathogens (mainly S. pneumoniae with S. aureus or/and Enterobacterales) prevailed - 57.7% of cases; associations of bacteria and viruses were identified in 38.5% of patients, different viruses - in one case. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in adults with SCAP. A high rate of respiratory viruses (mainly rhinovirus and influenza viruses) identification both as mixt infection with bacteria and mono - infection should be taken into account."

This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

However, such data have seldom been validated against microbiological laboratory results. Objective: To assess the validity of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) organism-specific administrative codes for pneumonia using microbiological data (test results for blood or respiratory culture, urinary antigen, or polymerase chain reaction) as the criterion standard. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study conducted between February 2017 and June 2019 using data from 178 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. Patients were aged 18 years or older admitted with pneumonia and discharged between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015. Data were analyzed from February 14, 2017, to June 27, 2019. Exposures: Organism-specific pneumonia identified from ICD-9 codes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ICD-9 codes using microbiological data as the criterion standard. Results: Of 161 529 patients meeting inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [16.2] years; 51.2% women), 35 759 (22.1%) had an identified pathogen. ICD-9-coded organisms and laboratory findings differed notably: for example, ICD-9 codes identified only 14.2% and 17.3% of patients with laboratory-detected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Although specificities and negative predictive values exceeded 95% for all codes, sensitivities ranged downward from 95.9% (95% CI, 95.3%-96.5%) for influenza virus to 14.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-20.8%) for parainfluenza virus, and positive predictive values ranged downward from 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.6%) for Staphylococcus aureus to 57.1% (95% CI, 39.4%-73.7%) for parainfluenza virus. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, ICD-9 codes did not reliably capture pneumonia etiology identified by laboratory testing; because of the high specificities of ICD-9 codes, however, administrative data may be useful in identifying risk factors for resistant organisms. The low sensitivities of the diagnosis codes may limit the validity of organism-specific pneumonia prevalence estimates derived from administrative data."

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. METHODS: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs   480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress   SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs   480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs   480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs   480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19."

To highlight this principle, we examined acute kidney injury (AKI) in IgA-dominant infection-associated glomerulonephritis (GN) and menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS). Both GN and mTSS are rare diseases caused by staphylococcal infection, and renal function is frequently impaired. The resulting AKIs are disparate pathological entities driven by distinct immune mechanisms. We begin by describing the case of a diabetic man with pyopneumothorax following methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He had endocapillary proliferative GN with in situ IgA-dominant immune-complex formation in the mesangium accompanied by complement C3 deposition in the glomerular capillary wall. By contrast, acute tubular necrosis was observed in a case of mTSS; the patient's immune response was stimulated differently by MRSA enterotoxin and exotoxin resulting in aberrant IgA deposition, complement activation, and insufficient antibody production. As a multidisciplinary communication covering the fields of nephrology, immunology, and pathology, this report may help clinicians to understand these distinct renal lesions and make optimal therapeutic decisions expeditiously."

Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) is a less recognized cause of rapidly destructive lung infection resulting in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Unlike many other bacterial infections, SAG can cross fascial planes and cause fulminant infections. Necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscesses due to SAG often fails conservative therapy with antimicrobials and requires definitive surgical intervention.

Methods: A total of 1 872 neonates, who were admitted into NICU of Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital and subjected to mechanical ventilation from October 2016 to June 2018, were enrolled in the study. The neonates who met the diagnostic criteria of VAP were selected as the case group, and those who were treated with ventilator for 48 hours at the same time were regarded as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of VAP. Results: Of the 1 872 neonates who underwent the mechanical ventilation, the VAP occurred in 160 cases with the incidence rate of 8.5% (160 cases). The 227 specimens were collected. Gram-positive bacteria (n=116, 51.1%) were the main pathogens. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii. By Chi-square test, birth weight, birth age, Apgar score, duration of ventilator, and whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension were influencing factors. The result of logistic regression analysis showed that compared with no pregnancy included hypertension, the first aid measure at birth was initial resuscitation, and the MV time <= 5 days, the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates included: their mothers with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, using of tracheal intubation and ventilator time more than 5 days. Conclusion: The incidence of VAP in neonates receiving continuous MV therapy in neonatal intensive care unit is higher. Gram-positive bacteria are the main pathogens. VAP in neonates is related to whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension, MV duration and tracheal intubation."

Complicated community-acquired pneumonia should be suspected in any child with pneumonia not responding to appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48-72 h. Common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients have initial imaging with chest radiography and ultrasound, which can also be used to assess the lung parenchyma, to identify pleural fluid; CT scanning is not usually indicated. Complicated pneumonia is treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, and then oral antibiotics. The initial choice of antibiotic is guided by local microbiological knowledge and by subsequent positive cultures and molecular testing, including on pleural fluid if a drainage procedure is done. Information from pleural space imaging and drainage should guide the decision on whether to administer intrapleural fibrinolytics. Most patients are treated by drainage and more extensive surgery is rarely needed; in any event, in low-income and middle-income countries, resources for extensive surgeries are scarce. The clinical course of complicated community-acquired pneumonia can be prolonged, especially when patients have necrotising pneumonia, but complete recovery is the usual outcome."

However, associations between S aureus carriage and the development of S aureus intensive care unit (ICU) pneumonia (SAIP) have not been quantified accurately, and interpretation of available data is hampered because of variations in definitions. Objective: To quantify associations of patient-related and contextual factors, including S aureus colonization status, with the occurrence of SAIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted in ICUs of 30 hospitals in 11 European countries, geographically spread across 4 regions. Among patients with an anticipated length of stay 48 hours or longer who were undergoing mechanical ventilation at ICU admission, S aureus colonization was ascertained in the nose and lower respiratory tract. From this group, S aureus-colonized and noncolonized patients were enrolled into the study cohort in a 1:1 ratio. Data analysis was performed from May to November 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: SAIP was defined as any pneumonia during the ICU stay developing 48 hours or more after ICU admission with S aureus isolated from lower respiratory tract specimens or blood samples. The incidence of SAIP was derived in the study cohort and estimated on the weighted incidence calculation for the originating overarching population, while taking competing events into account. Weighted risk factor analysis was performed using Cox multivariable regression. Results: The study cohort consisted of 1933 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.0 [16.0] years); 1252 patients (64.8%) were men, and 950 patients (49.1%) were S aureus carriers at ICU admission. In all, 304 patients (15.7%) developed ICU-acquired pneumonia, of whom 131 patients (6.8%) had SAIP. Weighted SAIP incidences were 11.7 events per 1000 patient-days in the ICU for S aureus-colonized patients and 2.9 events per 1000 patient-days in the ICU for noncolonized patients (overall incidence, 4.9 events per 1000 patient-days in the ICU). The only factor independently associated with SAIP was S aureus colonization status at ICU admission (cause-specific hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-6.0; P < .001). There were marked regional differences in SAIP incidence and cause-specific hazard ratios for colonization status. Conclusions and Relevance: SAIP incidence was 4.9 events per 1000 ICU patient-days for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation at ICU admission (or shortly thereafter). The daily risk of SAIP was 3.6 times higher in patients colonized with S aureus at ICU admission compared with noncolonized patients."

In the third world countries, information about CAP etiology is scarce. Therefore, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic methods are crucial to determine etiological agents. METHODS: Between March 2016 and March 2017, we have prospectively studied the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular aspects of patients with CAP at 2 tertiary-level hospitals in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 274 children were evaluated, with a median age of 13 months. An etiologic agent was identified in 187 patients (68.2%): 54% (n = 148) were viruses and 14.2% (n = 39) were bacteria. CAP prevalence was highest among children under 2 years (71%; 195/274); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent cause in 22% (60/274), especially among infants, followed by influenza (14.5%; 40/274). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 7% of the total (19/274), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3%;8/274) and Haemophilus influenzae (1.4%;4/274). Together, these cases accounted for 79.5% (31/39) of all bacterial CAP. Pleural effusion (PE) complicated CAP in 13.8% (38/274), of which 29 were of bacterial etiology. RT-PCR increased the detection rate of pneumococcus by 47%. Coinfection occurred in 28 patients (10%); 26 (9.5%) required intensive care and 9 patients (3%) died. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR provided additional diagnostic value to conventional, clinical, and laboratory methods. The higher prevalence of RSV, influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the need for preventive measures with better vaccine uptake and future research for RSV vaccines."

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Six ICUs from two university-affiliated hospitals. PATIENTS: Brain-dead adult patients managed in the participating ICUs over a 4-year period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 231 included patients, 145 (62.8%) were classified as ideal or extended-criteria potential lung donors at ICU admission and the remaining 86 patients having baseline contraindication for donation. Culture-proven aspiration pneumonia and early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 54 patients (23.4%) and 15 patients (6.5%), respectively (overall pneumonia incidence, 29.9%). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacterales were the most common pathogens. Using mixed-effects Cox proportional hazard models, age (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.96-0.99]), anoxic brain injury (3.55 [1.2-10.5]), aspiration (2.29 [1.22-4.29]), and not receiving antimicrobial agents at day 1 (3.56 [1.94-6.53]) were identified as independent predictors of pneumonia occurrence in the whole study population. Analyses restricted to potential lung donors yielded similar results. Pneumonia was associated with a postadmission decrease in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio and lower values at brain death, in the whole study population (estimated marginal mean, 294 [264-323] vs 365 [346-385] mm Hg in uninfected patients; p = 0.0005) as in potential lung donors (299 [248-350] vs 379 [350-408] mm Hg; p = 0.04; linear mixed models). Lungs were eventually retrieved in 31 patients (34.4%) among the 90 potential lung donors with at least one other organ harvested (pneumonia prevalence in lung donors (9.7%) vs nondonors (49.2%); p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia occurs in one-third of brain-dead patients and appears as the main reason for lung nonharvesting in those presenting as potential lung donors. The initiation of antimicrobial prophylaxis upon the first day of the ICU stay in comatose patients with severe brain injury could enlarge the pool of actual lung donors."

Recent guidelines encourage immediate empiric antibiotic treatment once a diagnosis of CAP is made. Concerns about treatment recommendations, on the one hand, and antibiotic stewardship, on the other, motivated this review of the medical literature on the etiology of CAP. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature on the etiology of CAP using methods defined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed using a combination of the keywords 'pneumonia', 'CAP', 'etiology', 'microbiology', 'bacteriology', and 'pathogen'. We examined articles on antibiotics that were develop to treat pneumonia. We reviewed all 'related articles' as well as studies referenced by those that came up in the search. After we excluded articles that did not give sufficient microbiological data or failed to meet other predetermined criteria, 146 studies remained. Data were stratified into diagnostic categories according to the microbiologic studies that were done; results are presented as the percentage in each category of all cases in which an etiology was established. Results: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP although declining in incidence; this decline has been greater in the US than elsewhere. Haemophilus influenzae is the second most common cause of CAP, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli. The incidence of all bacteria as causes of CAP has declined because, with routine use of PCR for viruses, the denominator, cases with an established etiology, has increased. Viruses were reported on average in about 10% of cases, but recent PCR-based studies identified a respiratory virus in about 30% of cases of CAP, with substantial rates of viral/bacterial coinfection. Conclusion: The results of this study justify current guidelines for initial empiric treatment of CAP. With pneumococcus and Haemophilus continuing to predominate, efforts at antibiotic stewardship might be enhanced by greater attention to the routine use of sputum Gram stain and culture. Because viral/bacterial coinfection is relatively common, the identification of a virus by PCR does not, by itself, allow for discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy."

The risk of coinfections is high and responsible for a worse prognosis, mainly in the case of bacterial involvement and in the presence of particular comorbidity. We present the clinical, laboratory, radiologic characteristic along with therapeutic management of a patient with COVID-19 and Staphylococcus aureus coinfection. Case Presentation: A 55-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital due to a two-day history of fever and acute dyspnea with severe respiratory failure worsened after the administration of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. Her medical history comprehended a triple negative, BRCA1-related, PD-L1 positive right breast cancer with multiple bone metastasis, causing bone marrow infiltration-related severe pancytopenia. Her physical examination revealed scattered wheezes, rales, and bilateral dry crackles in the middle and lower lung fields and lower limb paresis. The body mass index was 30 kg/m2 and arterial blood gas evaluation revealed a stage III acute respiratory distress syndrome. Microbiological specimens revealed a Staphylococcus aureus positivity from endotracheal aspirate. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of large areas of parenchymal consolidation and aerial bronchogram, bilateral ""ground glass"" areas reaching the highest extension on the upper and middle zones. The high clinical and radiological suspicion of COVID-19 along with the negative result of nasopharyngeal specimen make necessary an endotracheal aspirate resulting positive for SARS-CoV2. Patient started an antimicrobial treatment and lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine but, unfortunately, died five days after hospital admission. Conclusion: The high risk of mortality of our patient was due to viral-bacterial coinfection, advanced cancer status with active immunotherapy. This case highlights the need for a prompt clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation to allow a correct diagnosis and start a specific therapy."

It usually results from head trauma, but there have been case reports of iatrogenic causes including on non-invasive mechanical ventilation. We report a case of pneumocephalus resulting from high mechanical ventilation pressures in a patient without prior head trauma. A 37-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy who had been ventilator-dependent through tracheostomy was admitted for shortness of breath and intermittent fevers. The patient was found to have pneumonia, with left-lower lobe consolidation, and was started on linezolid given known Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from previous sputum culture; he was later switched to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam given persistent fevers to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient went into septic shock requiring multiple pressors as well as stress steroids for persistent shock, with eventual improvement in hemodynamics. He developed further respiratory acidosis on his usual ventilator settings, and peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) progressively increased to as high as 45-70 cm H2O during his hospital course. PIPs did not improve with suctioning or after bronchoscopy. On the 17th day of the patient's stay, he had acutely altered mental status with non-reactive fixed and dilated pupils and disconjugate gaze of the right eye on neurologic examination. CT of the head at that time revealed extensive pneumocephalus along the bifrontal convexities, suprasellar cisterns, and posterior fossa, with a possible fracture of the frontal skull base near the ethmoid roof. Mount Fuji sign was present on CT scan, indicative of ""tension pneumocephalus"". Neurosurgical consultation was obtained but the family declined intervention given his overall debilitated stated. Comfort measures were instituted, and the patient expired the following day. Pneumocephalus is the accumulation of air entry into the cranial cavity, generally from head trauma, inflammation, or surgery. Patients may have underlying base skull defects or microfractures that permit air to enter the intracranial cavity. Increased sphenoid sinus pressure from mechanical ventilation may enter the subperiosteal space, allowing air to enter the intracranial cavity. It is important to consider pneumocephalus in a patient with new neurological findings after mechanical ventilation."

We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with underlying human immunodeficiency virus who presented with fever and altered mental status. Subsequent workup supported a diagnosis of Austrian syndrome. During the 5-week course of ceftriaxone treatment, she developed fever, pruritus and follicular accentuation throughout the body. Labs were significant for eosinophilia, which along with systemic symptoms, supported the diagnosis of a drug reaction. Coagulase negative staphylococcus bacteremia was discovered when the patient developed septic shock. Subsequently, diffuse desquamative eruption with rapidly progressing sloughing appeared and biopsy proved toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patient eventually succumbed to multiorgan failure."

We present a case of a newborn hospitalised in three clinics (two clinics from Timisoara and one from Vienna), and operated for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, without aortic coarctation, using a mixed technique cardiovascular repair surgery. The initial therapeutic conduct included maintaining the permeability of the arterial canal with prostaglandin E1. At the Vienna General Hospital, at the age of 17 days, bilateral banding of the pulmonary artery was performed and, at the age of 20 days, during the cardiac catheterisation, the Rashkind procedure (balloon atrial septostomy) was performed, with two stents being implanted in the arterial canal. Postoperative complications were postcardiotomy syndrome, pneumonia with Enterococcus faecalis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, sepsis with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulopathy, mixed anaemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient died 1 month after the intervention due to cardiorespiratory arrest, bilateral congestive heart failure, left heart hypoplasia with shunt through the arterial canal and pulmonary artery banding, multiorgan failure, and severe secondary haemorrhagic disease. In conclusion, the initial cardiac surgical reconstruction consisted of a mixed technique, and anticoagulant medical treatment with heparin, antibiotics (bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis to be performed throughout life); postintervention hypoxic and infectious complications resulted in multiorgan failure and death."

METHODS: For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. CONCLUSION: The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed."

Methods: We studied two sampling sets (Set 1 and Set 2). Set 1 consisted of results of testing 3382 assays of out-patients and hospital patients (5-88 years old) with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia of yet undetermined aetiology. Set 2 contained results of 1204 assays of hospital patients (12-94 years old) with pneumonia and COVID-19 already diagnosed by molecular biological techniques in test laboratories. The results were collected in twelve Russian cities/provinces in time range 2 March - 5 May 2020. Assays were analysed for 10 bacterial, 15 viral, 2 fungal and 2 parasitic aetiological agents. Results: In Set 1, 4.35% of total pneumonia cases were related to SARS-CoV-2, with substantially larger proportion (18.75%) of deaths of pneumonia with COVID-19 diagnosed. However, studying Set 2, we revealed that 52.82% patients in it were also positive for different typical and atypical aetiological agents usually causing pneumonia. 433 COVID-19 patients (35.96%) were tested positive for various bacterial aetiological agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infections accounting for the majority of secondary pneumonia cases. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a COVID-19 patient as a complication. An essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Russia in March-May 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. The problem of hospital-acquired bacterial infection is exceptionally urgent in treating SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia and its further complications, should be given very serious attention in combating SARS-CoV-2."

Our aim was to comparatively analyze the incidence, epidemiology, and outcomes of secondary pneumonia in adult patients hospitalized with influenza versus noninfluenza viral infections and determine whether influenza particularly predisposes to secondary infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis from a single tertiary medical center of adult patients admitted to the hospital between 2008 and 2010 with respiratory viral infections. Microbiological patterns and clinical outcomes were compared between those with influenza (VI, n = 57) and those with noninfluenza (NI, n = 77) respiratory viral infections. RESULTS: The NI group was older (60.6 +- 14.0 versus 53.3 +- 19.7 years, p = 0.019) with higher rates of lung transplantation (29% versus 9%, p = 0.009) than VI. Overall, 35% developed secondary pneumonia, higher among NI (44%) than VI (23%, p = 0.017). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of pneumonia in VI, whereas Gram-negative rods were most frequently identified in NI. The NI group had longer hospital [median 10 (interquartile range (IQR) 6-19) versus 6 (IQR 4-15) days, p = 0.019] and intensive care unit [median 4 (IQR 0-12) versus 0 (IQR 0-8) days, p = 0.029] stays compared with VI. Further, the NI group was more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit compared with VI (62% versus 39%, p = 0.011). A trend towards increased mortality was observed in viral infections complicated by secondary pneumonia than primary viral infections (28% versus 15%, p = 0.122). CONCLUSION: Secondary pneumonia is common among adults hospitalized with viral respiratory infections. Within our population, NI results in more frequent secondary pneumonia and longer hospital stays than those with VI. Given the high number of infections caused by Gram-negative rods, monitoring local epidemiology is critical for guiding initial antibiotic selection in empirical treatment of secondary infections.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section."

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and microbial features, and outcome of patients with invasive staphylococcal infection. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the children admitted to PICU with invasive staphylococcal infections. Invasive staphylococcal infection was defined as clinical infection with isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from a normally sterile body site. Results: A total of 50 children (1 month to 16 years) were identified with staphylococcal infections during the study period. There was male preponderance (75%) with high prevalence in school going children. Among these children, 36% (18) were coagulase-negative (CONS), which were excluded. Of the remaining, 64% (32) were coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, 54% (27) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 10% (5) were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Community-acquired staphylococcal infections were present in 24 children (CA-MRSA). Pneumonia with empyema was the most common 20 (62%) site of primary staphylococcal infection, followed by blood stream infection 9 (28%) and skin and soft tissue infection 3 (9%). Of the soft tissue infection, three were MRSA, with two had pyopericardium with infective endocarditis. Resistance in MSSA was found to be maximum to penicillin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin with no resistance with vancomycin. Conclusion: There is an increase incidence of MRSA among community-acquired staphylococcal infections requiring intensive care management. A larger study on clinical profile of Staphylococcus infection in pediatrics is urgently needed to define the exact magnitude of the problem.

METHODS: This was an observational study of prospectively collected data of consecutive adults with CAP and a definitive etiology enrolled between 2004 and 2018. Patients were divided into MSSA CAP and pneumococcal CAP groups for analysis. RESULTS: A microbial etiology was established in 1,548 (33%) cases: S. aureus caused 6% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases. In the latter, 52 were due to MSSA (60% of S. aureus CAP cases, and 3% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases) and 34 were due to MRSA (40% of S. aureus CAP cases, and 2% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases). S. pneumoniae was identified in 734 (47%) microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases. The presence of fever was independently associated with a lower risk of MSSA CAP (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.99). Patients with MSSA CAP had higher 30-day mortality than patients with pneumococcal CAP, both before and after adjustment for potential confounders (21% vs 7%, p=0.002). MSSA was independently associated with 30-day mortality in the overall population. CONCLUSION: MSSA CAP was associated with worse outcomes than pneumococcal CAP in our cohort.

Drug-resistant pathogens are one of the major challenges to control. The study aimed to identify the major etiological agents, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated factors of septicemia among pediatric patients in southern Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pediatric patients. Blood samples were cultured and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion techniques. Data were collected by pre-tested questionnaire to identify potential associated factors of septicemia. A bivariate logistic regression analysis was used and adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI at <=0.05 level of significance was computed to determine the presence and strength of the association. Results: Of 238 participants, 27 (11.3%) of them had a positive blood culture. Staphylococcus aureus (32.2%), coagulase negative Staphylococci (25%), and Klebsiella pneumonia e (14.3%) were the predominant isolates. The isolated bacteria showed high rates of resistance to amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin and ampicillin. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was observed in 82.1% of the isolates. Being infant [AOR=4.18, 95% CI, (1.3-13.0)], admission >10 days [AOR=5.54, 95% CI, (1.51-20.41)], burn [AOR=3.55, 95% CI, (1.02-12.38)] and wound cases [AOR=5.52, 95% CI, (1.50-20.34)] were associated with pediatric septicemia. Conclusion: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates and majority of isolates were MDR pathogens. Very young age, prolonged hospital stays, burn and wound cases were associated with pediatric septicemia.

METHODS: We pooled the susceptibility and clinical data of CAP patients enrolled in five clinical trials conducted in three countries from 2006 to 2017. The published pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of oral (500 mg) and intravenous (IV; 500, 650, and 750 mg) nemonoxacin formulations and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of the two aforementioned CAP-related Gram-positive cocci (GPC) were used to determine plausible CBPs. Moreover, the nemonoxacin MIC distributions of CAP-relatedS. pneumoniae (n = 1,800) and S. aureus (n = 2,000) isolates were obtained to evaluate the ECOFF values using a visual estimation approach and ECOFFinder. RESULTS: More than 92% of the patients with CAP caused byS. pneumoniae or S. aureus with nemonoxacin MICs<=0.25 mg/L presented positive clinical and microbiological outcomes. The ECOFF, MIC90, and MIC99 values of nemonoxacin were 0.06, 0.125, and 1 mg/L, respectively, for the S. pneumoniae isolates, and 0.125, 1, and 8 mg/L for the S. aureus isolates, respectively. Based on the differences in the PK profiles of oral and IV formulations, PD parameters of nemonoxacin for these CAP-GPC, and clinical in vivo efficacy data, tentative CBPs of 0.5, 0.5, and 1 mg/L were established for the 500-mg oral and 500- and 750-mg IV nemonoxacin formulations, respectively, for S. pneumoniae, and 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/L, respectively, for S. aureus.

In multiple studies, MRSA nasal swabs have been shown to have a negative predictive value (NPV) of ~99% in non-oncology patients with pneumonia and other infections. We evaluated the performance characteristics of a negative MRSA nasal swab in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) populaion to determine its NPV. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PATIENTS: This study included adult AML patients with a suspected infection and a MRSA nasal swab collected between 2013 and 2018. METHODS: MRSA nasal swab and culture-documented infections were identified to determine the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value of the MRSA nasal swabs. RESULTS: In total, 194 patients were identified, and 484 discrete encounters were analyzed. Overall, 468 (97%) encounters had a negative MRSA nasal swab upon admission with no cultured documented MRSA infection during their hospitalization. However, 3 encounters (0.6%) had a negative MRSA nasal swab with a subsequent cultured documented MRSA infection during their admission. Identified infections were bacteremia (n = 2) and confirmed pneumonia (n = 1). MRSA nasal swab had a sensitivity of 62% (95% CI, 0.24-0.91), specificity of 98% (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), positive predictive value of 38% (95% CI, 0.21-0.6), and NPV of 99% (95% CI, 0.98-1). CONCLUSIONS: A negative MRSA nasal swab has a 99% NPV for subsequent MRSA infections in AML patients with no prior history of MRSA colonization or infection. Based on these findings, a negative MRSA nasal swab can help guide de-escalation of empiric MRSA antibiotic therapy."

METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study, patients >= 18 year old who had SBI (Glasgow coma scale GCS score < 9) who received mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h were analysed. The main objective was to identify risk factors for S. aureus VAP vs VAP due to other pathogens and to identify risk factors for S. aureus VAP vs patients who did not experience VAP. RESULTS: 847 patients with SBI were admitted in ICU after severe traumatic brain injury (n = 489, 58%), aneurysmal SAH (n = 156, 18%), stroke (n = 27, 3%), spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (n = 80, 9%), arteriovenous malformation rupture (n = 25, 3%), and other causes (n = 70, 8%). Three hundred fifty of 847 patients (41%) had VAP with S. aureus (n = 161) or other pathogens (n = 189). In patients with VAP, the multivariate analysis shows that age per 10 years of ageing (OR 0.80, 95%CI [0.70; 0.90]; p < 0.001) and no tobacco use (OR 0.54, 95%CI [0.33;0.88]; p = 0.014) were protective factors against S. aureus.

There was a significant difference between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups for age (48 vs. 64 years), but not for 30-day mortality (7.7% vs. 10.3%), ICU LoS (4.8 vs. 4.6 days) and hospital LoS (10.9 vs. 15.1 days), respectively. Likely causative pathogen(s) were identified in 117 patients; Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (28.2%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (19.7%), Influenza A/B (16.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14.5%). CONCLUSION: A high incidence of SCAP was observed in Central Australia, disproportionately affecting the Indigenous population. Prevention strategies are imperative, as well as early identification of SCAP and appropriate empiric antibiotic regimens. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Methods: Non-duplicated nosocomial cases as well as pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from 11 teaching hospitals across China were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clinically significant strains were determined by agar dilution method or broth microdilution method. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S29 criteria were used for interpretation, and the WHONET-5.6 software was used in data analysis. Results: A total of 1 590 cases were collected, including 831 cases from BSI, 450 cases from HAP and 309 cases from IAI. The most prevalent pathogens causing BSI were Escherichia coli (29.2%, 243/831), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%, 135/831) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%, 84/831); the most prevalent pathogens causing IAI were E. coli (26.2%, 81/309), Enterococcus faecium (15.5%, 48/309) and K. pneumoniae (13.3%, 41/309); while Acinetobacter baumanii (24.7%, 111/450), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%, 93/450) and K. pneumoniae (16.2%, 73/450) were dominated in HAP. All S. aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides; 77.8% (105/135) of S. aureus strains were susceptible to ceftaroline. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.6% (40/135) of all the S. aureus, and was lower than the accounted rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) (83.7%, 41/49). One E. faecium strain (1.1%, 1/95) resistant to vacomycin and teicoplanin and one E. faecalis strain (2.3%, 1/43) resistant to linezolid was found. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 56.1% (193/344) in E. coli and 22.1% (55/249) in K. pneumonia; the rate of carbapenem resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 4.1% (14/344) and 22.9% (57/249), respectively; the percentage of ceftazidime/avibactam resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 2.3% (8/344) and 2.0% (5/249), respectively; the percentage of colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 1.5% (5/344) and 7.6% (19/249), respectively; no E. coli and K. pneumonia strains were found resistant to tigecycline. The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa were 78.9% (146/185) and 36.7% (66/180), respectively. A. baumanii showed low susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents except colistin (99.5%, 184/185) and tigecycline (91.4%, 169/185). Colistin, amikacin and ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa with susceptility rate of 100% (180/180), 93.3% (168/180) and 85.6% (154/180), respectively. Conclusions: Nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens show high susceptibilities to tigecycline, colistin and ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro. Antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii is a serious problem. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has increased, which should be monitored continuously in China."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus saccharolyticuID:33384973TITLE:Outcome of Severe Bacterial Pneumonia in the Era of Pneumococcal Vaccination.ABSTRACT:Introduction: After the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae has decreased whereas Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes could be increasing. These bacteria have been associated with high rates of complications. Aims: (1) To describe the characteristics of pediatric bacterial CAP requiring hospitalization. (2) To compare outcomes according to causative microorganisms. (3) To analyze changes in bacterial CAP rate and etiology over time. Patients and Methods: Retrospective single-center study of inpatients aged 1 month-16 years with culture-confirmed bacterial CAP in 2010-2018 in Madrid, Spain. Results: We included 64 cases (42 S. pneumoniae, 13 S. pyogenes and 9 S. aureus). Culture-confirmed CAP represented 1.48-2.33/1,000 all-cause pediatric hospital admissions, and its rate did not vary over time. However, there was a significant decrease in pneumococcal CAP in the last 3 years of the study (78% of CAP in 2010-2015 vs. 48% in 2016-18, p = 0.017). Median hospital stay was 10.5 days (interquartile range 5-19.5), 38 patients (59%) developed complications and 28 (44%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Outcomes were similar among children with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus CAP, whereas S. pyogenes was associated with a higher risk for complications (OR 8 [95%CI 1.1-57.2]) and ICU admission (OR 7.1 [95%CI 1.7-29.1]) compared with pneumococcal CAP. Conclusion: In a setting with high PCV coverage, culture-confirmed bacterial CAP did not decrease over time and there was a relative increase of S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Children with CAP caused by S. pyogenes were more likely to develop complications."

Bacterial coinfection has been reported to be rare. We aimed at describing the rate of bacterial coinfection in critically ill adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All the patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of Tenon University-teaching hospital, from February 22 to May 7th, 2020 were included. Respiratory tract specimens were obtained within the first 48 h of ICU admission. During the study period, 101 patients were referred to the ICU for COVID-19 with severe pneumonia. Most patients (n = 83; 82.2%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated on ICU admission. Overall, 20 (19.8%) respiratory tract specimens obtained within the first 48 h. Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen identified, accounting for almost half of the early-onset bacterial etiologies. We found a high prevalence of early-onset bacterial coinfection during severe COVID-19 pneumonia, with a high proportion of S. aureus. Our data support the current WHO guidelines for the management of severe COVID-19 patients, in whom antibiotic therapy directed to respiratory pathogens is recommended."

We conducted a systematic review and comparative meta-analysis of VCM and LZD efficacy against proven MRSA pneumonia. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PubMed until November 2019. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were mortality, clinical cure, microbiological evaluation, and adverse events. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1,239 patients and eight retrospective cohort or case-control studies (CSs) with a total 6,125 patients were identified. Clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates were significantly increased in patients treated with LZD in RCTs (clinical cure: risk rate (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.71-0.92, microbiological eradication: RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62-0.81) and CSs (clinical cure: odds rate (OR) = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.18-0.69). However, mortality was comparable between patients treated with VCM and LZD in RCTs (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.88-1.32) and CSs (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.94-1.53). Likewise, there was no significant difference in adverse events between VCM and LZD in CSs (thrombocytopenia: OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.50-1.82, nephrotoxicity: OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.85-3.45). CONCLUSIONS: According to our meta-analysis using RCTs and CSs conducted in worldwide, our findings would be one of robust evidences to corroborate the guidelines by IDSA for the treatment of proven MRSA pneumonia."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus saccharolyticuID:33407229TITLE:Toxic shock syndrome with a cytokine storm caused by Staphylococcus simulans: a case report.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Exotoxins secreted from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes act as superantigens that induce systemic release of inflammatory cytokines and are a common cause of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). However, little is known about TSS caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present a rare case of TSS caused by Staphylococcus simulans (S. simulans). CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia from S. simulans following an influenza infection. The patient met the clinical criteria for probable TSS, and her symptoms included fever of 39.5  C, diffuse macular erythroderma, conjunctival congestion, vomiting, diarrhea, liver dysfunction, and disorientation. Therefore, the following treatment was initiated for bacterial pneumonia complicating influenza A with suspected TSS: meropenem (1 g every 8 h), vancomycin (1 g every 12 h), and clindamycin (600 mg every 8 h). Blood cultures taken on the day after admission were positive for CoNS, whereas sputum and pharyngeal cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae (Geckler group 4) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, respectively. However, exotoxins thought to cause TSS, such as TSS toxin-1 and various enterotoxins, were not detected. The patient's therapy was switched to cefazolin (2 g every 8 h) and clindamycin (600 mg every 8 h) for 14 days based on microbiologic test results. She developed desquamation of the fingers on hospital day 8 and was diagnosed with TSS. Conventional exotoxins, such as TSST-1, and S. aureus enterotoxins were not detected in culture samples. The serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as neopterin and IL-6, were high. CD8+ T cells were activated in peripheral blood. Vbeta2+ population activation, which is characteristic for TSST-1, was not observed in the Vbeta usage of CD8+ T cells in T cell receptor Vbeta repertoire distribution analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of S. simulans-induced TSS. Taken together, we speculate that no specific exotoxins are involved in the induction of TSS in this patient. A likely mechanism is uncontrolled cytokine release (i.e., cytokine storm) induced by non-specific immune reactions against CoNS proliferation."

The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of these infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clinico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1-May 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57-89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon beta-1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients. Urinary (53) and RIs (39) constituted the majority of superinfections Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant was the main agent of IR and bacteremia. An outbreak of A. baumannii contributed to this result. Three patients were considered to have probable pulmonary aspergillosis. Mortality was higher in UCI patients (50 vs. 29%; p = 0.028). The predictive factors of mortality included being a male with various comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, bacteremia and superinfections from A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of A. baumannii was a determining factor in the increases of the incidence of infection and the morbi-mortality of ICU patients."

The treatment thereof resulted in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). The pneumonia was initially treated with intravenous piperacillin and tazobactam and the patient transferred to a tertiary hospital. There, the diagnosis of S. aureus bacteraemia secondary to a pulmonary source was confirmed and treatment was changed to intravenous flucloxacillin and the patient was discharged to hospital in the home (HITH is a service that allows short-term healthcare at home to be provided to people who would otherwise need to be in hospital) to complete the antibiotic course. Five weeks after commencing flucloxacillin, the patient was referred back to hospital with nausea and worsening kidney function with an associated significant HAGMA. The patient has a background of chronic kidney disease and chronic back pain for which she was taking long-term paracetamol. The HAGMA was determined to be due to a pyroglutamic acidosis (PGA), deemed secondary to the combined use of paracetamol and flucloxacillin. This was subsequently confirmed with a plasma pyroglutamic acid concentration level of 7467 micromol/L (reference range 20-50 micromol/L) and a urinary level of 1700 mmol/mol creatinine (<110 mmol/mol creatinine). To our knowledge, this is the highest plasma and urinary levels published to date. Furthermore, considering the common use of paracetamol and penicillins, it is important to recognise HAGMA as a potential complication of co-administration of paracetamol and iso-oxylopenicillin. The HAGMA resolved after cessation of flucloxacillin despite the continuation of paracetamol and without administration of N-acetylcysteine. PGA-related HAGMA appears to be a unique potential side effect of iso-oxylopenicillin rather than other beta-lactams."
