","SPECIES:Chlamydia felisID:24580994TITLE:Pediatric feline upper respiratory disease.ABSTRACT:Infectious feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) continues to be a widespread and important cause of morbidity and mortality in kittens. Multiple pathogens can contribute to URTD in kittens, and coinfections are common in overcrowded environments and contribute to increased disease severity. Worldwide, the most prevalent pathogens are feline herpesvirus-1 and feline calicivirus. Primary bacterial causes of URTD in cats include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydia felis, and Mycoplasma species. Streptococcus canis and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus occasionally play a role as primary pathogens in shelter situations and catteries. This article reviews the major causes of disease in kittens, and provides an update on treatment and prevention strategies. "

In the present study, 186 cats from three non-commercial catteries in Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil were evaluated. The detection of Chlamydia felis was performed by PCR. The clinical severity was scored from 1 to 4, with a score of 4 as the most severe manifestation. The total occurrence of C. felis was of 18.82% (35/186) of cats overall, but notably, 58.06% (18/31) of infected cats originated from a single cattery. All animals harboring C. felis had URTD clinical signs and higher scores (3 and 4). In addition, C. felis occurrence was associated with the presence of cryptic plasmid. However, the virulence and clinical severity were not correlated. "

Between October 2009 and July 2011, patients with community-acquired pneumonia visited 26 facilities in Japan; we collected survey forms from 105 of these patients who were suspected of having atypical pneumonia based on the Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for the Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults. We examined the safety in 105 patients and the efficacy in 71 patients. 1. The efficacy rates among patients suspected of having atypical pneumonia and those with a confirmed diagnosis of atypical pneumonia were 94.8% (55/58 patients) and 92.3% (12/13 patients), respectively. The efficacy rate was 4/4 for patients in whom Chlamydophila pneumoniae was detected (including 1 patient with a polymicrobial infection with another bacterial strain) and 90% (9/10 patients) for patients in whom Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected (garenoxacin was ineffective in 1 of 2 patients with a polymicrobial infection with another bacterial strain). 2. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (including abnormal laboratory tests) was 4.8% (5/105 patients). Among the adverse drug reactions, gastrointestinal disorders, infection and infestation, nervous system disorder, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder were observed in 2.9% of patients (3/105), 1.0% (1/105), 1.0% (1/105), and 1.0% (1/105), respectively. In conclusion, garenoxacin showed an efficacy rate of greater than 90% for suspected atypical pneumonia and confirmed atypical pneumonia. Garenoxacin is considered to be useful in daily practice."

Symptomatic infections due to C. pneumoniae are associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections. OBJECTIVES: Analysis of the frequency of C. pneumoniae antigens detection in children in the Lower Silesia Region in 2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 303 throat swabs obtained from 130 girls and 173 boys, aged 20 months to 18 years, were tested. The patients who were entered into the study were treated due to various respiratory disorders. Examinations were performed by IFA technique, using the Chlamydia Cell PN testing kits (Cellabs Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia). RESULTS: The presence of C. pneumoniae antigen was detected in 95/303 (31.4%) of all examined children (in 48/130 (36.9%) of girls and in 47/173 (27.2%) of boys). In the group of patients with dry cough, as the most common presenting clinical symptom of respiratory infection, the positive IFA test results for C. pneumoniae occurred in 32 out of 94 (34.0%) of girls and in 34 out of 117 (29.1%) of boys. In the case of the examined children with other prevailing clinical symptom, which included a cough with discharge and a runny nose, the positive tests for C. pneumoniae were shown in 13 out of 27 (48.1%) of girls and in 9 out of 42 (21.4%) of boys. In the group of children without symptoms of infection, who had direct contact with C. pneumoniae infected person, there were 3 out of 9 (33.3%) of girls and 4 out of 14 (28.6%) of boys positively tested cases. CONCLUSIONS: Results of IFA studies for C. pneumoniae in throat swabs in children varies according to clinical symptoms and seasonality. There were no clear gender and age-related differences. C. pneumoniae test should be considered only after the presence of microorganisms typical of respiratory infections has been excluded."

Fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute Q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. In southern Taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has never been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, May 2012 to April 2013, 166 cases of adult CAP and 15 cases of acute Q fever were prospectively investigated. Cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with CAP. From April 2004 to April 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute Q fever were also included retrospectively for analysis. The geographic distribution of Q fever and CAP cases was similar. Q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than CAP. Based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were independent characteristics associated with Q fever. In patients with Q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. Twelve (7.2%) cases of CAP were seropositive for C. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute Q fever. Among CAP cases, 22.9% had a CURB-65 score  2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), S. pneumoniae (6.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. Moreover, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Taiwan, Q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as the major presentation and is not a common etiology of CAP."

Two hundred and eighteen individuals (98 AMI and 120 non-AMI) were selected at two Clinical Centers. Blood samples were drawn to extract DNA and RNA and to measure laboratory variables including anti-Cpn IgM and IgG. Cpn and Mpn genomic DNA as well as TLR2, TLR4, IL-6 and TNFA mRNA expression were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Gene polymorphisms were detected by PCR-HRM. AMI patients had higher positivity for Cpn-DNA (17.3%) than non-AMI group (6.7%, p=0.018). In addition, Cpn-DNA positivity was an independent predictor of risk for AMI (OR: 2.56, CI: 1.08 - 6.04, p=0.031). Positivity for anti-Cpn IgG and Mpn-DNA was similar between AMI and non-AMI (&gt; 0.05). TLR4 mRNA expression was higher in AMI than non-AMI individuals (p=0.005). CD14 -260C&gt; T, TNFA -308A&gt; G, TLR2 c.2258G&gt; A, TLR4 c.896A&gt; G and TLR4 c.1196&gt; T variants were not associated with increased risk for AMI (p&gt; 0.05). In the AMI group, individuals carrying CD14 -260CC genotype had higher hsCRP levels than CT/TT carriers (p=0.041). These results are suggestive that Cpn-DNA positivity and increased TLR4 mRNA expression in blood leukocytes may be associated with AMI and could be useful markers to evaluate the severity and progression of the atherosclerotic disease in AMI patients.

Such etiological data for Vietnam is scarce and clinical doctors lack accurate information on which to base their diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia. This study identifies the prevalence and risk factors of severe community acquired pneumonia due to these atypical pathogens (severe-ApCAP) in children aged 1-15 years with CAP in a pediatric hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: 722 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited for detecting those atypical pathogens, using multiplex PCR and ELISA. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected. Multivariate logistic-regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of potential risk factors with severe-ApCAP. RESULTS: Among 215 atypical pathogen-positive CAP cases, 45.12% (97/215) were severe-ApCAP. Among the severe-ApCAP group, 55.67% (54/97) cases were caused by pure atypical pathogens and 44.33% (43/97) resulted from a co-infection with typical respiratory pathogens. M. pneumoniae was the most common, with 86.6% cases (84/97) in the severe-ApCAP group, whereas C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila were less frequent (6.19% and 7.22%, respectively). The highest rate of severe-ApCAP was in children younger than two years (65.98%). The differences related to age are statistically significant (P = 0.008).The factors significantly associated with severe-ApCAP were age (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.93, P = 0.001), co-infection with typical bacteria (OR = 4.86, 95% CI = 2.17-10.9, P &lt; 0.0001), co-infection with respiratory viruses (OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 1.46-13.0, P = 0.008), respiratory/cardiac system malformation (OR = 14.8, 95% CI = 1.12-196, P = 0.041) and neonatal pneumonia (OR = 11.1, 95% CI = 1.06-116, P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Severe-ApCAP presented at a significant rate in Vietnamese children. More than 50% of severe-ApCAP cases were associated with pure atypical pathogen infection. M. pneumoniae appeared most frequently. The highest rate of severe-ApCAP was in children younger than two years. Younger age and co-infection with typical bacteria or viruses were the most significant risk factors, while respiratory/cardiac system malformation and neonatal pneumonia were additional potential risk factors, associated with severe-ApCAP in Vietnamese children."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:25566754TITLE:Antibiotics for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children.ABSTRACT:Background. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is widely recognised as an important cause of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. Pulmonary manifestations are typically tracheobronchitis or pneumonia but M. pneumoniae is also implicated in wheezing episodes in both asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals. Although antibiotics are used to treat LRTIs, are view of several major textbooks offers conflicting advice for using antibiotics in the management of M. pneumoniae LRTI in children.Objectives To determine whether antibiotics are effective in the treatment of childhood LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae infections acquired in the community.Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 4, 2014), EMBASE (1980 to July, 2014), and both WHOICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov (13 August 2014).Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics commonly used for treating M. pneumoniae (i.e. macrolide, tetracycline or quinolone classes) versus placebo, or antibiotics from any other class in the treatment of children under 18 years of age with community acquired LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae.Data collection and analysis The review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and assessed methodological quality. We extracted and analysed relevant data separately and resolved disagreements by consensus.Main results A total of 1912 children were enrolled from seven studies. Data interpretation was limited by the inability to extract data that referred to children with M. pneumoniae. In most studies, clinical response did not differ between children randomised to a macrolide antibiotic and children randomised to a non-macrolide antibiotic. In one controlled study (of children with recurrent respiratory infections, whose acute LRTI was associated with Mycoplasma, Chlamydia or both, by polymerase chain reaction and/or paired sera) 100% of children treated with azithromycin had clinical resolution of their illness compared to 77% not treated with azithromycin at one month. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw any specific conclusions about the efficacy of antibiotics for this condition in children (although one trial suggests macrolides may be efficacious in some children with LRTI secondary to Mycoplasma). The use of antibiotics has to be balanced with possible adverse events. There is still a need for high quality, double-blinded RCTs to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae in children."

During 2011-2012, we used molecular methods to test adult patients in Germany with confirmed CAP for infection with these 2 pathogens. Overall, 12.3% (96/783) of samples were positive for M. pneumoniae and 3.9% (31/794) were positive for Chlamydia spp.; C. psittaci (2.1%) was detected more frequently than C. pneumoniae (1.4%). M. pneumoniae P1 type 1 predominated, and levels of macrolide resistance were low (3.1%). Quarterly rates of M. pneumoniae-positive samples ranged from 1.5% to 27.3%, showing a strong epidemic peak for these infections, but of Chlamydia spp. detection was consistent throughout the year. M. pneumoniae-positive patients were younger and more frequently female, had fewer co-occurring conditions, and experienced milder disease than did patients who tested negative. Clinicians should be aware of the epidemiology of these pathogens in CAP. "

To determine the optimum serum collection point for the ELNAS plate in the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae pneumonia, we analyzed the kinetics of the antibody response in patients with laboratory-confirmed C. pneumoniae pneumonia. We enrolled five C. pneumoniae pneumonia cases and collected sera from patients for several months. The kinetics of the IgM and IgG antibody responses were similar among the five patients. Significant increases in IgM and IgG antibody titer between paired sera were observed in all patients. IgM antibodies appeared approximately 2-3 weeks after the onset of illness, reached a peak after 4-5 weeks, and were generally undetectable after 3-5 months. IgG antibodies developed slowly for the first 30 days and reached a plateau approximately 3-4 months after the onset of illness. The kinetics of IgA antibody responses were different among the five patients, and significant increases in IgA antibody titer between paired sera were observed in only two patients. Although the sample size was small, the best serum collection time seemed to be approximately 3-6 weeks after onset of illness when using a single serum sample for the detection of IgM antibodies. Paired sera samples should be obtained at least 4 weeks apart. IgA antibody analysis using ELNAS may not be a useful marker for acute C. pneumoniae pneumonia. "

Using the Pneumoslide IgM test, the presented study explored the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia and investigated further whether there was an association between age or season and aetiological organisms. METHODS: Serum samples, taken between August 2011 and August 2013, from patients with CAP were tested with the Pneumoslide IgM kit. The Pneumoslide IgM technology can simultaneously diagnose 9 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Coxiella burnetii (COX), Chlamydophila pneumonia (CP), Adenovirus (ADV), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A (INFA), Influenza B (INFB), Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs). The data was analyzed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS, version 11.0). RESULTS: Of a total of 1204 serum samples tested, 624 samples were positive. M. pneumoniae was the dominant pathogen, with INFB, PIVs, and RSV ranking second to fourth, respectively. The positive percentages of MP, INFB, PIVs and RSV were found to be associated with age, especially MP, INFB and PIVs. The positive percentages of MP, PIVs and RSV were also found to be associated with season. The positive percentage of MP in autumn was the highest. The positive percentages of LP1 in August and September, ADV in June and INFB in March were relatively higher than that in other months. CONCLUSIONS: The results show there were 4 main viral and atypical bacterial pathogens causing CAP in our study. Some pathogens were found to be associated with age and season. M. pneumoniae was the most predominant pathogen among these 9 pathogens. It is necessary to take preventative measures in order to prevent the spread of these pathogens in susceptible age groups during peak season."

We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional methods to describe etiology of CAP in hospitalized adults and evaluated their respective diagnostic yields. METHODS: 267 CAP patients were enrolled consecutively over our 3-year prospective study. Conventional methods (i.e., bacterial cultures, urinary antigen assays, serology) were combined with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and by real-time PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 12 types of respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Etiology was established in 167 (63%) patients with 69 (26%) patients having &gt;=1 copathogen. There were 75 (28%) pure bacterial and 41 (15%) pure viral infections, and 51 (19%) viral-bacterial coinfections, resulting in 126 (47%) patients with bacterial and 92 (34%) patients with viral etiology. S. pneumoniae (30%), influenza (15%) and rhinovirus (12%) were most commonly identified, typically with &gt;=1 copathogen. During winter and spring, viruses were detected more frequently (45%, P=.01) and usually in combination with bacteria (39%). PCR improved diagnostic yield by 8% in 64 cases with complete sampling (and by 15% in all patients); 5% for detection of bacteria; 19% for viruses (P=.04); and 16% for detection of &gt;=1 copathogen. Etiology was established in 79% of 43 antibiotic-naive patients with complete sampling. S. pneumoniae qPCR positive rate was significantly higher for OP swab compared to NP swab (P&lt;.001). Positive rates for serology were significantly higher than for real-time PCR in detecting B. pertussis (P=.001) and influenza viruses (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Etiology could be established in 4 out of 5 CAP patients with the aid of PCR, particularly in diagnosing viral infections. S. pneumoniae and viruses were most frequently identified, usually with copathogens. Viral-bacterial coinfections were more common than pure infections during winter and spring; a finding we consider important in the proper management of CAP. When swabbing for qPCR detection of S. pneumoniae in adult CAP, OP appeared superior to NP, but this finding needs further confirmation.

Although it can be caused by a wide variety of micro-organisms, the pneumococcus, atypicals, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and certain Gram-negative rods are the usual pathogens encountered. The site-of-care decision is critical in determining the site and type of care as well as the extent of diagnostic workup. Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible particularly in those requiring admission to hospital, but typically the physician does not know with any degree of certainty the identity of the etiologic pathogen. A number of national guidelines have been published to help the physician with this choice. The initial drug(s) can be modified if necessary if the pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern becomes known. Adjunctive therapy such as pressors and fluid replacement are of value and macrolides appear to help as well, likely secondary to their immunomodulatory effects. Recent data also suggest a role for steroids. "

Presently, few studies about CAP are available from Southeast Asia. This study aimed to investigate the etiology, severity, and outcome of CAP in the most populous Southeast Asia country, Indonesia. METHODS: From October 2007 to April 2009, adult patients admitted with CAP to two hospitals in Semarang, Indonesia, were included to detect the etiology of CAP using a full range of diagnostic methods. The severity of disease was classified according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). The outcome was assessed as 30-day mortality. RESULTS: In total, 148 consecutive patients with CAP were included. Influenza virus (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%) were the most common agents identified. Other Gram-negative bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae each accounted for 5%. The bacteria presented wild type antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Forty-four percent of subjects were high-risk patients (PSI class IV-V). The mortality rate (30%) was significantly associated with disease severity score (P&lt;0.001), and with failure to establish an etiological diagnosis (P=0.027). No associations were found between etiology and underlying diseases, PSI class, nor mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Viruses and Gram-negative bacilli are dominant causes of CAP in this region, more so than S. pneumoniae. Most of the bacteria have wild type susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Patients with severe disease and those with unknown etiology have a higher mortality risk."

METHODS: The clinical data of inpatients with CAP between January 2013 and Novermber 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. The gold standard for identification of MP infection was determined by both positive culture and real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Blood and sputum culture were used to detect other bacteria and fungi, and real time PCR to detect Chlamydia and Legionella pneumonia and the common respiratory viruses. Diagnostic test results consistency inspection was performed by Kappa test and continuous variable analysis was performed using t test. RESULTS: Data from 139 CAP inpatients were analyzed. An aetiological diagnosis was made for 61 patients (43.9%). Thirty-five cases (25.2%) were diagnosed as MP infection by the gold standard, while 72 cases (52.0%) by the JRS scoring system. The sensitivity of JRS scoring system for the diagnosis of MP infection was 85.7% (30/35), specificity 59.6% (62/104), positive predictive value 41.7% (30/72)and negative predictive value 92.5% (62/67). According to age, for the patients younger than 40 years old, the sensitivity of JRS routine scoring system for the diagnosis of MP infection was 24/24, specificity was 4/29, positive predictive value 24/49 and negative predictive value was 4/4. CONCLUSIONS: The JRS scoring system provides an auxiliary value for the identification of MP pneumonia. It has a high sensitivity and a strong negative predictive value.

We sought to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) method to diagnosis these bacterial infections in CAP patients and to compare the diagnostic yields obtained from mPCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), and induced sputum (IS) with those obtained with specific PCR commercial kits, paired serology, and urinary antigen. RESULTS: A total of 225 persons were included. Of these, 10 patients showed serological evidence of L. pneumophila infection, 30 of M. pneumoniae, and 18 of C. pneumoniae; 20 individuals showed no CAP. The sensitivities were mPCR-NPS = 23.1%, mPCR-IS = 57.1%, Seeplex -IS = 52.4%, and Speed-oligo -NPA/NPS = 11.1%, and the specificities were mPCR-NPS = 97.1%, mPCR-IS = 77.8%, Seeplex -IS = 92.6%, and Speed-oligo -NPA/NPS = 96.1%. The concordance between tests was poor (kappa &lt;0.4), except for the concordance between mPCR and the commercial kit in IS (0.67). In individuals with no evidence of CAP, positive reactions were observed in paired serology and in all PCRs. CONCLUSIONS: All PCRs had good specificity but low sensitivity in nasopharyngeal samples. The sensitivity of mPCR and Seeplex  in IS was approximately 60%; thus, better diagnostic techniques for these three bacteria are required."

METHODOLOGY: Eighty hospitalized CAP patients and 110 healthy adults were enrolled. Overall prevalences of C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies in sera and the rate of acute infection were estimated, using the microimmunofluorescence method (MIF), at titers of 1:16 and 1:512, respectively. Moreover, a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect C. pneumoniae DNA in nasopharyngeal and blood Buffy coat samples. RESULTS: Overall chlamydial IgG prevalence was higher in CAP cases than controls (70% versus 61.8%). Similarly, higher rate of acute infection was found in patients than in controls (16.3% versus 5.5%). By focusing on subjects testing positive at 1:16, acute infection was detectable in 23.2% of CAP cases, compared with 8.8% of seropositive controls. Chlamydial DNA was confirmed in 8.2% and 8.8% of nasopharyngeal specimens from controls and patients, respectively. Moreover, 10.9% and 7.5% of Buffy coats from controls and cases, respectively, were PCR-positive. When performances of both assays for detection of the pathogen were assessed, the sensitivities of MIF and PCR were low and comparable. However, MIF demonstrated higher specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value than PCR. CONCLUSIONS: MIF-based data indicate that C. pneumoniae could be a potential causal agent of CAP in Jordan.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of these triggers and their relationship to severe asthma. METHODS: 82 patients were enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional study from January 2007 to March 2013 and they were divided into three study groups: Group 1: 27 children with severe asthma, Group 2: 29 children with stable asthma and Group 3: 26 children which was the control group. Serological tests included IgG and IgM for both C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Average age +- SD was 10.9 +- 2.5 for Group 1; 10.1 +- 2.9 for Group 2 and 9.9+- 1.9 for Group 3 (p = 0.4). M. pneumoniae IgM was observed in 6/27 (22.2%) in Group 1, 2/29 (6.9%) in Group 2 and 0/26 in the Control Group (p = 0,01). C.pneumoniae IgM was present in 7/26 (26.9%) in Group 1, 2/29 (6.9%) in Group 2 and 0/26 in Group 3 (p = 0.005). No significant difference was observed between Group 2 and Group 3.

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:27276986TITLE:Community-acquired pneumonia related to intracellular pathogens.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide; the annual incidence of CAP among adults in Europe has ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 per 1000 population. Intracellular bacteria are common causes of CAP. However, there is considerable variation in the reported incidence between countries and change over time. The intracellular pathogens that are well established as causes of pneumonia are Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Coxiella burnetii. Since it is known that antibiotic treatment for severe CAP is empiric and includes coverage of typical and atypical pathogens, microbiological diagnosis bears an important relationship to prognosis of pneumonia. Factors such as adequacy of initial antibiotic or early de-escalation of therapy are important variables associated with outcomes, especially in severe cases. Intracellular pathogens sometimes appear to cause more severe disease with respiratory failure and multisystem dysfunction associated with fatal outcomes. The clinical relevance of intracellular pathogens in severe CAP has not been specifically investigated. We review the prevalence, general characteristics, and outcomes of severe CAP cases caused by intracellular pathogens. "

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:27317257TITLE:Atypical aetiology in patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia is associated with age, gender and season; a data-analysis on four Dutch cohorts.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be categorised into viral, typical and atypical (Legionella species, Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia species). Extensive microbiological testing to identify the causative microorganism is not standardly recommended, and empiric treatment does not always cover atypical pathogens. In order to optimize epidemiologic knowledge of CAP and to improve empiric antibiotic choice, we investigated whether atypical microorganisms are associated with a particular season or with the patient characteristics age, gender, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A data-analysis was performed on databases from four prospective studies, which all included adult patients hospitalised with CAP in the Netherlands (N = 980). All studies performed extensive microbiological testing. RESULTS: A main causative agent was identified in 565/980 (57.7 %) patients. Of these, 117 (20.7 %) were atypical microorganisms. This percentage was 40.4 % (57/141) during the non-respiratory season (week 20 to week 39, early May to early October), and 67.2 % (41/61) for patients under the age of 60 during this season. Factors that were associated with atypical causative agents were: CAP acquired in the non-respiratory season (odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95 % CI 2.68-6.84), age &lt;60 year (OR 2.9, 95 % CI 1.83-4.66), male gender (OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.06-2.71) and absence of COPD (OR 0.2, 95 % CI 0.12-0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical causative agents in CAP are associated with respectively non-respiratory season, age &lt;60 years, male gender and absence of COPD. Therefore, to maximise its yield, extensive microbiological testing should be considered in patients &lt;60 years old who are admitted with CAP from early May to early October.

Quick diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation determine favorable outcome. Empirical antibiotic treatment allows to achieve treatment success in most patients. Treatment recommendations are based on big epidemiological trials. Nevertheless, it is sometimes necessary to know the definite etiologic factor of pneumonia. In these cases microbiological diagnostics is useful, i.e. sputum microscopy and culture, blood culture, bronchial lavage culture, bacterial antigen tests in urine, molecular tests. Serological tests do not help much in everyday clinical practice. The most common microorganisms causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila), Haemophilus influenzae, influenza virus. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely are etiologic factors of CAP. First line antibiotics in pneumonia treatment are beta - lactams. In case of allergy or intolerance of beta - lactams, new fluorochinolones should be used. Macrolides are useful if the atypical etiology is suspected. Duration of treatment in most cases should not exceed 7 days, sometimes it may be even shorter. "

Since it is difficult to detect C. pneumoniae in clinical practice, specific etiological diagnosis is established only in a minority of cases. AIMS: To investigate the role of C. pneumoniae in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children, with the use of serological tests and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: One hundred children, age of 2 months to 12 years, hospitalized for community-acquired LRTIs were investigated for C. pneumoniae etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 100 children hospitalized for community-acquired LRTIs, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting anti-C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin G antibodies and nasopharyngeal aspirates for analysis of C. pneumoniae PCR. The demographic, clinical, and radiological findings for C. pneumoniae antibody positive and C. pneumoniae antibody negative cases were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data analysis was performed by Chi-square test and Fisher's exact tests using Epi Info (2002). RESULTS: Clinical and radiological findings in both the groups were comparable. A relatively higher rate of C. pneumoniae infection in children was observed below 5 years of age. Serological evidence of C. pneumoniae infection was observed in 12 (12%) patients and nested PCR was positive in 5 (5%) children. Thirteen (13%) patients were diagnosed with C. pneumoniae infection by serology and/or nested PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that C. pneumoniae plays a significant role in community-acquired LRTIs in children of all ages, even in children aged &lt;5 years."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:27960206TITLE:Role of Atypical Pathogens in the Etiology of Community-Acquired Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Atypical pneumonia has been described for over 100 years, but some of the pathogens attributed to it have been identified only in the past decades. The most common pathogens are Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The epidemiology and pathophysiology of these three pathogens have been studied since their discovery, and are reviewed herein to provide better insight when evaluating these patients, which hopefully translates into improved care. The incidence of atypical pathogens has been shown to be approximately 22% worldwide, but this probably varies with location. The history and physical exam of a patient with atypical pneumonia reveals how patients share many signs and symptoms with their counterpart patients who have typical pneumonias; therefore, the diagnosis primarily depends on laboratory identification, which is evolving and improving. What started out as simple, but difficult to yield cultures, has progressed to modern molecular-based testing assays. Treatment is missed if an empiric regimen includes only monotherapy with a beta-lactam antimicrobial; so, many country guidelines, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia, recommend using a regimen containing either a macrolide or a fluorinated quinolone. Once an atypical pathogen has been identified, evidence trends toward favoring a quinolone, but more data are needed to confirm. The concept of using combination therapy in severe patients is also explored."

Aging population, dense urbanization, and poor access to health care make the Asia-Pacific region vulnerable to CAP. The high incidence of CAP poses a significant health and economic burden in this region. Common etiologic agents in other global regions including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses are also the most prevalent pathogens in the Asia-Pacific region. But the higher incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the presence of Burkholderia pseudomallei are unique to the region. The high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae has been raising the need for more prudent use of antibiotics. Emergence and spread of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus deserve attention, while the risk has not reached significant level yet in cases of CAP. Given a clinical and socioeconomic importance of CAP, further effort to better understand the epidemiology and impact of CAP is warranted in the Asia-Pacific region."

The objective of this study is to determine prospectively the etiology of community-acquired pulmonary infections in hospitalized adults living with HIV. Patients were submitted to an extended microbiological investigation that included molecular methods. The microbiological findings were evaluated according to severity of the disease and pneumococcal vaccine status. Two hundred twenty-four patients underwent the extended microbiological investigation of whom 143 (64%) had an etiology determined. Among the 143 patients with a determined etiology, Pneumocystis jirovecii was the main agent, detected in 52 (36%) cases and followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis accounting for 28 (20%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Rhinovirus were diagnosed in 22 (15%) cases each and influenza in 15 (10%) cases. Among atypical bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was responsible for 12 (8%) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae for 7 (5%) cases. Mixed infections occurred in 48 cases (34%). S pneumoniae was associated with higher severity scores and not associated with vaccine status.

Methods: We analyzed serum PCT concentrations from children hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP enrolled in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) Study. Blood and respiratory specimens were tested using multiple pathogen detection methods for typical bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus), atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae), and respiratory viruses. Multivariable regression was used to assess associations between PCT concentrations and etiology and severity. Results: Among 532 children (median age, 2.4 years; interquartile range [IQR], 1.0-6.3), patients with typical bacteria had higher PCT concentrations (+-viruses; n = 54; median, 6.10; IQR, 0.84-22.79 ng/mL) than those with atypical bacteria (+-viruses; n = 82; median, 0.10; IQR, 0.06-0.39 ng/mL), viral pathogens only (n = 349; median, 0.33; IQR, 0.12-1.35 ng/mL), or no pathogen detected (n = 47; median, 0.44; IQR, 0.10-1.83 ng/mL) (P &lt; .001 for all).

The prevalence of atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis among patients with these illnesses in the ambulatory setting has not been previously summarized. We set out to derive prevalence information from the existing literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE for prospective, consecutive-series studies reporting the prevalence of M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, L pneumophila and/or B pertussis in outpatients with cough, acute bronchitis, LRTI, or CAP. Articles were independently reviewed by 2 authors for inclusion and abstraction of data; discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion. A meta-analysis was performed on each pathogen to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates using a random effects model of raw proportions. RESULTS: Fifty studies met our inclusion criteria. While calculated heterogeneity was high, most studies reported prevalence for each pathogen within a fairly narrow range. In patients with CAP, the overall prevalences of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were 10.1% (95% CI, 7.1%-13.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%), respectively. Consistent with previous reports, M pneumoniae prevalence peaked in roughly 6-year intervals. Overall prevalence of L pneumophila was 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%), but the organism was rare in children, with only 1 case in 1,765. In patients with prolonged cough in primary care, the prevalence of B pertussis was 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-19.8%), although it was higher in studies that included only children (17.6%; 95% CI, 3.4%-31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical bacterial pathogens are relatively common causes of lower respiratory diseases, including cough, bronchitis, and CAP. Where surveillance data were available, we found higher prevalences in studies where all patients are tested for these pathogens. It is likely that these conditions are underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in current clinical practice."

AIM: To assess the etiology of CAP in immunocompetent adult hospitalized patients using conventional and molecular diagnostic methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 240 adult patients who were hospitalized for CAP to identify the microbial etiology. Sputum and blood cultures were obtained as well as serology testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of sixteen respiratory viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In 100 patients (41.7%) a single respiratory pathogen was identified. In 17 (7.1%) cases, a mixed bacterial and viral infection was detected and no pathogen was identified in 123 cases (51%). The most commonly identified pathogens identified were: influenza virus (15.4%), parainfluenza virus (10.8%), rhinovirus (5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5%), respiratory syncytial virus (2.9%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2.5%). Infectious agent detection by RT-PCR provided greater sensitivity than conventional techniques. Viral respiratory infections were more prevalent in older patients with comorbidities and high risk patients, according to the Fine index at hospital admission.

Objectives: We assessed the possibility of association between clinical failure and acute infection by these bacteria among children with CAP treated with amoxicillin. Patients and methods: Patients aged 2-59 months with non-severe CAP received amoxicillin during prospective follow-up. Acute and convalescent blood samples were collected. Probable acute infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (specific IgM antibodies), by Chlamydia pneumoniae or Chlamydia trachomatis (specific IgM antibodies and/or IgG/IgA titre change) was investigated. Outcomes were assessed during follow-up at 2, 5 and 14-28 days. Treatment failure included development of danger signs, persistent fever, tachypnoea or death. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01200706. Results: Of 787 children, 86 (10.9%; 95% CI = 8.9%-13.3%) had acute M. pneumoniae infection. C. pneumoniae acute infection was found in 79 of 733 (10.8%; 95% CI = 8.7%-13.2%) and C. trachomatis was found in 3 of 28 (10.7%; 95% CI = 2.8%-26.5%) &lt;6 months old.

Currently, the management of atypical pneumonia due to these pathogens is blurry. The clinical features are hardly specific ; it appears that M. pneumoniae respiratory infect ions are associated with chest pain and the absence of wheezing, however, further confirmations are needed. Hoarseness is frequently seen with C. pneumoniae infection. Co-infections with viruses, bacteria or even between M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae can be frequent. Infection with either of these bacteria seems to increase the incidence of asthma. PCR appears to be the most sensitive and specific for rapid diagnosis of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections, however, it cannot dif ferentiate asymptomatic carriage from infection. Serodiagnosis can be helpful. This requires two serum samples taken with several weeks interval. Macrolides are the classical antibiotics used for treatment of these pathogens. In vivo efficacy of antibiotic treatment of M. pneumoniae remains unclear. Resistance to macrolides in M. pneumoniae treatment has been described. In conclusion, there is still a lack in scientific literature of high level evidences and clear consensus in the management of suspicious infection due to M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae."

The worldwide incidence of asthma has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 300 million children and adults worldwide currently suffer from this incurable disease and 255,000 die from the disease each year. It is now well accepted that asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome and many clinical subtypes have been described. Viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been implicated in asthma exacerbation in children because of their ability to cause severe airway inflammation and wheezing. Infections with atypical bacteria also appear to play a role in the induction and exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults. Recent studies confirm the existence of an infectious asthma etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly by other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes. It is also likely that early-life infections with microbes such as CP could lead to alterations in the lung microbiome that significantly affect asthma risk and treatment outcomes. These infectious microbes may exacerbate the symptoms of established chronic asthma and may even contribute to the initial development of the clinical onset of the disease. It is now becoming more widely accepted that patterns of airway inflammation differ based on the trigger responsible for asthma initiation and exacerbation. Therefore, a better understanding of asthma subtypes is now being explored more aggressively, not only to decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms but also to select treatment and guide prognoses. This review will explore infection-mediated asthma with special emphasis on the protean manifestations of CP lung infection, clinical characteristics of infection-mediated asthma, mechanisms involved and antibiotic treatment outcomes."

METHODS: Two phase 3, double-blind, comparative safety and efficacy studies of ceftaroline fosamil vs. ceftriaxone, FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2, enrolled adults with CAP. Only FOCUS 1 included 24-h adjunctive clarithromycin therapy for all patients on day 1. Day 4 and test-of-cure (TOC) outcomes were compared for adjunctive vs. no adjunctive therapy. RESULTS: Of 1240 enrolled patients, 130 patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens alone were included (FOCUS 1, n = 64; FOCUS 2, n = 66). Among patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or Chlamydophila pneumoniae alone, a higher clinical response rate was observed with clarithromycin plus ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone compared with treatment without additional clarithromycin at day 4 [38/49 (77.6%; FOCUS 1) vs. 24/43 (55.8%; FOCUS 2)], but not at the TOC assessment [42/49 (85.7%; FOCUS 1) vs. 41/43 (95.3%; FOCUS 2)]. In patients infected with Legionella pneumophila alone, a higher clinical response rate with adjunctive clarithromycin therapy was observed at the TOC assessment alone [12/12 (100%; FOCUS 1) vs. 14/19 (73.7%; FOCUS 2)]. The unadjusted odds ratio of a favourable clinical response at day 4 with adjunctive clarithromycin vs. no adjunctive clarithromycin was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.1; P = 0.0299) for all pathogens combined.

The drug-resistance rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin reached above 85%, and the drug-resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin were above 50%; they were all sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. The drug-resistance rates of Haemophilus influenzae to cefaclor and cefuroxime were above 60%, but it was sensitive to cefotaxime. The drug-resistance rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to ampicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone were above 60%, but they were sensitive to carbapenems and compound preparation of enzyme inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are the main pathogens in children with severe CAP and mixed infection is prevalent. The drug-resistance rates of these pathogenic bacteria are high."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:28900526TITLE:Lung US features of severe interstitial pneumonia: case report and review of the literature.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Chlamydia pneumonia is reported to account for a relatively large number of cases of CAP. In elderly patients in particular, the clinical presentation can be a severe form of diffuse interstitial pneumonia. The chest X-ray presentation is aspecific. Lung US can show a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome; in some cases, like the present one, the association of multiple B lines with a coarse and thickened pleural line points to a more likely diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia. CASE REPORT: We present the case of an 87-year-old woman with severe interstitial chlamydial pneumonia, for whom lung US was very useful for directing diagnosis and for follow-up during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The use of lung US in the diagnosis of interstitial syndrome is likely to improve the care of patients in whom the diagnosis is a consideration; it offers better characterization than a chest X-ray and is free from CT radiation. Furthermore, the concept of using lung US for monitoring a patient is one of the major innovations that has emerged from recent studies."

METHODS: The literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, Web-of Science, and the Chinese databases Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. All CAP etiological studies on children under 5 y of age from China published in Chinese and English between the years of 2001 and 2015 were included. A total of 48 studies were included in the final review, comprising 100 151 hospitalized children with CAP episodes. Heterogeneity and the percentage of variation between studies was analyzed based on Q statistic and I2 indices, respectively. Random effect models were used to calculate the weighted average rate in all analyses. RESULTS: The most frequently detected bacterial agents were Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.2%), Escherichia coli (5.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.9%), Haemophilus influenza (3.6%) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (3.3%). The most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (20.3%, in just 2 studies), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 17.3%), human bocavirus (9.9%), parainfluenza virus (5.8%), human metapneumovirus (3.9%) and influenza (3.5%). Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were identified in 9.5% and 2.9%, respectively, of children under 5 y of age with CAP. CONCLUSION: This article provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the factors contributing to CAP in children under 5 y of age. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and influenza were the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in children. Corresponding, vaccines should be introduced into Chinese immunization programs, and further economic evaluations should be conducted. RSV is common in Chinese children and preventative measures could have a substantial impact on public health. These data also have major implications for diagnostic strategies and empirical treatments."

Previous infections could increase the risk of ischemic stroke by an activation of systemic inflammation. We analysed the influence of previous infections and Chlamydia pneumoniae serology on functional outcome in thrombolysed stroke patients. METHODS: Consecutive thrombolysed stroke patients admitted during calendar year 2011 were analysed. Demographics, vascular risk factors, clinical and aetiological data were registered. Standardised blood tests were collected acutely for each patient, including inflammatory factors. Primary outcome was the functional outcome at 6months follow-up. t-test, Mann-Withney U test and chi-square test were applied for univariate analysis, while a logistic regression was performed for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were included in the analysis. Median onset-to-needle time was 156min. A previous infection occurred in 16.9% of patients, while a positive IgA antiChlamydia was detected in 40 cases. Good functional outcome was achieved by 72.5% of patients. At multivariate analysis poor outcome was associated to clinical severity, delay treatment time, haemorrhagic transformation and large artery etiological stroke type (p&lt;0.01). Also IgA antiChlamydia pneumonia seropositivity (OR: 3.699; 95%CI: 1.094-12.512; p: 0.035) and poststroke infections (OR: 6.031; 95%CI: 2.485-11.301; p: 0.037) were predictors of poor outcome. INTERPRETATION: In this study IgA antiChlamydia pneumonia seropositivity represents a negative predictor of functional outcome in thrombolysed stroke patients. Further and larger studies are required to confirm these observations and to plan a prompt administration of antibiotics or immunomodulant agents."

After 1950, the proportion of pneumonia caused by pneumococcus began to decline. Pneumococcus has continued to decline; at present, this organism is identified in fewer than fewer10%-15% of cases. This proportion is higher in Europe, a finding likely related to differences in vaccination practices and smoking. Gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella are each identified in 2%-5% of patients with pneumonia who require hospitalization. Viruses are found in 25% of patients, up to one-third of these have bacterial coinfection. Recent studies fail to identify a causative organism in more than 50% of cases, which remains the most important challenge to understanding lower respiratory infection. Our findings have important implications for antibiotic stewardship and should be considered as new policies for empiric pneumonia management are developed."

METHODS: This study included a total of 4500 healthy subjects who were given physical examination in Shenzhen People's Hospital from January to December in 2016. Venous blood was drawn from people to detect the MP- and CP-specific IgG and IgM in the serum using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The relationship of MP and CP infections with patient age, seasons, and percentage of infections was analyzed. CONCLUSION: CP and MP cause high rate of asymptomatic infection, which may be associated with the high incidence of CP and MP infection, especially in children and the elderly population. Therefore, the implementation of effective and practical prevention measures has become an urgent need. MP culture and drug sensitivity test should be performed as early as possible in patients with manifested MP infections in order to ensure timely and proper treatment and to reduce the emergence of drug-resistant strains."

Asymptomatic C. pneumoniae carriage is also relatively common. The association of C. pneumoniae infections with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) course is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between chronic C. pneumoniae infection and clinical features of COPD, markers of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 59 patients with stable COPD who had no, or had &gt;=2 acute exacerbations during last year. The level of IgA and IgG antibody against C. pneumoniae, IL-6, IL-8, resistin, insulin, adiponectin and acyl ghrelin was measured in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: No differences in clinical and functional data were observed between COPD patients without serological features of C. pneumoniae infection and chronic C. pneumoniae infection. The level of anti C. pneumoniae IgA significantly correlated with IL-8, IL-6, resistin concentration in group of frequent exacerbators. IgG level correlated negatively with acetyl ghrelin and body mass index (BMI) in patients without frequent exacerbations, in contrast to frequent COPD exacerbation group where significant correlations between IgG level and BMI was demonstrated. Serum IL-6 correlated positively with resistin and insulin and negatively with adiponectin in group of patients with serological features of chronic C. pneumoniae infection only. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that chronic C. pneumoniae infection does not influence the clinical course of COPD in the both study groups. Chronic C. pneumoniae infections might be associated with a distinct COPD phenotype that affects metabolic dysfunction."

However, it is often difficult to evaluate acute C. pneumoniae infection using upper respiratory tract specimens and/or sputum samples due to its persistent infection or colonization. The interpretation of frequency of detection of C. pneumoniae seems to be insufficient in community-onset pneumonia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of C. pneumoniae using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. METHODS: BALF samples from 147 patients with pneumonia were retrospectively evaluated using C. pneumoniae-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. RESULTS: None of the samples had positive PCR results for C. pneumoniae using two different sets of specific primers. Single and paired serological analyses were performed in 54 (36.7%) and 37 (25.2%) patients, respectively. These analyses revealed that 1 of 37 (2.7%) patients had a presumptive acute infection with C. pneumoniae, 8 of the 54 (14.8%) patients were suspected of having a C. pneumoniae infection, and 7 of the 37 (18.9%) patients were suspected of having past C. pneumoniae infection. In addition, cultivation and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing detected Haemophilus influenzae in the presumptive case using the serological method. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study revealed that C. pneumoniae might be a minor causative agent of community-onset pneumonia according to an evaluation of specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract."

Annually, about 50% of more than 2.5 million pilgrims participating in this ritual get involved in severe devastating coughs. Most coughs continue, so the pilgrims turn back home and transmit them to family members and other people. Despite the high prevalence of coughs for many years, what causes them remains unknown. Considering the pertussis-like clinical picture of the so-called ""hajj coughs"", the researchers conducted a study to measure antibodies against three known common atypical bacteria, namely Bordetella Pertussis, Chlamydia Pneumonia and Mycoplasma Pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was done on three out of eleven groups of pilgrims from Yazd province, central Iran. The sample was selected randomly and consisted of 202 pilgrims who completed an informed consent. Their blood samples were taken, and the plasma was separated and then stored at -70  C. After turning back from the journey, the pilgrims had their second blood samples taken. As many as 52 pilgrims failed to come for the second sampling, and two samples were broken during transportation. The final analysis was performed on the remaining 148 pairs of samples. RESULTS: Antibodies were already elevated in many pilgrims before the journey probably due to their old age (causing more exposure to pathogens) or unplanned pertussis vaccination. After their return, antibody elevation was only mild, again probably due to the old age of the participants (i.e. due to their weaker immune systems). Some antibodies even fell down without any known reason. In this study, previous hajj journey was assumed as a prophylactic factor, due to acquisition of immunity. Coughs with a prolonged pertussis-like picture were also presumed to be more related than other types of coughs to atypical pathogens. Statistical tests showed that the history of previous journeys had no prophylactic effect. Also, no correlation was found between the clinical pictures of coughs and infection with atypical bacteria. CONCLUSION: Even though some rises and falls occurred in the antibodies titer, the variations could hardly be attributed to coughs in this study. Indeed, the variation of antibodies had no meaningful relationship with clinical factors. In this regard, further studies are needed to clarify the reason for the so-called ""hajj coughs"", but epidemiological studies will be difficult to do until easier and more reliable methods become available for accurate diagnosis."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:29397298TITLE:Detection of respiratory bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonia by multiplex Lightmix  RT-PCR.ABSTRACT:Pneumonia is a severe infectious disease. In addition to common viruses and bacterial pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae), fastidious respiratory pathogens like Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp. can cause severe atypical pneumonia. They do not respond to penicillin derivatives, which may cause failure of antibiotic empirical therapy. The same applies for infections with B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, the cause of pertussis disease, that may present atypically and need to be treated with macrolides. Moreover, these fastidious bacteria are difficult to identify by culture or serology, and therefore often remain undetected. Thus, rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonia is crucial. We performed a retrospective method evaluation study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the new, commercially available Lightmix  multiplex RT-PCR assay that detects these fastidious bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonia. In this retrospective study, 368 clinical respiratory specimens, obtained from patients suffering from atypical pneumonia that have been tested negative for the presence of common agents of pneumonia by culture and viral PCR, were investigated. These clinical specimens have been previously characterized by singleplex RT-PCR assays in our diagnostic laboratory and were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the respiratory multiplex Lightmix  RT-PCR. The multiplex RT-PCR displayed a limit of detection between 5 and 10 DNA copies for different in-panel organisms and showed identical performance characteristics with respect to specificity and sensitivity as in-house singleplex RT-PCRs for pathogen detection. The Lightmix  multiplex RT-PCR assay represents a low-cost, time-saving and accurate diagnostic tool with high throughput potential. The time-to-result using an automated DNA extraction device for respiratory specimens followed by multiplex RT-PCR detection was below 4 h, which is expected to significantly improve diagnostics for atypical pneumonia-associated bacterial pathogens."

The current study was aimed to study the microbial etiology of hospitalized adults with CAP. Methods: The study was conducted in a 700-bedded North Indian hospital. Consecutive adults admitted with CAP over a period of 2 years from 2013 to 2015 were recruited for the study, and apart from clinical evaluation underwent various microbiological studies in the form of blood culture, sputum culture, urinary antigen for pneumococcus and Legionella, serology for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for influenza viruses. Radiographic studies were performed in all patients and repeated as required. The patients were treated with standard antibiotic/antiviral therapy and outcomes were recorded. Results: A total of 225 patients (median age: 59 years) were enrolled. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism found (30.5%), followed by Legionella pneumophila (17.5%), influenza viruses (15.4%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (7.2%), Chlamydia pneumonia (5.5%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.1%), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (1.7%), and Acinetobacter sp. (0.8%) with 4% of patients having multiple pathogens etiologies. High Pneumonia Severity Index score correlated with the severity and outcome of the CAP but was not predictive of any definite etiological pathogen. In-hospital mortality was 8%. Conclusion: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella, and influenza constitute the most common etiological agents for north Indian adults with CAP requiring hospitalization. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and preventive strategies such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccination need to be considered in appropriate groups."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

Methods: A questionnaire was designed to address the common questions in CAP management. The responses were collected via WeChat and the data were analyzed. Results: A total of 1 254 valid questionnaires were received, 46.1% from tertiary , 26.4% from secondary and 27.5% from primary care hospitals. Of these valid respondents, 31.4% were respiratory physicians and 68.6% from non-respiratory physicians. When diagnosing CAP, 78.1% of the doctors would use chest CT in more than 50% of the patients. Regarding the tools for evaluating the severity of CAP, 60.3% of the respondents would prefer CURB-65. ""Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and septic shock"" were the most common criteria for admission to ICU. Blood culture was not widely used in severe CAP regardless of the level of hospitals (P&gt;0.05). The results of this survey showed that the top 5 pathogenic microorganisms of CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Chlamydia pneumoniae. For non-severe CAP patients, all the doctors tended to select monotherapy. The most frequently used antimicrobial regimen for severe CAP was third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin monotherapy. As for combination therapy, the most frequently used regimen in tertiary hospitals was ""carbapenem plus vancomycin"" , while in primary and secondary hospitals it was ""beta-lactams plus macrolides"" . More doctors from primary hospitals and non-respiratory medicine would consider ""complete resolution of pulmonary opacity"" as the indication to discontinue antimicrobial therapy or to discharge patients, and ""prolonged high fever"" , ""large area consolidation"" , ""multiple lobe-segment involvement "" as the indication for corticosteroid therapy. A significantly lower proportion of doctors in secondary and tertiary hospitals would recommend patients to receive vaccination than in primary hospitals (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: This questionnaire study showed that there was a gap between the ideal and the real world practice in CAP management. Efforts should be made to popularize the 2016 CAP guideline in hospitals of any level of care, especially primary hospitals, for the purpose of further standardizing CAP management in China."

Three hundred forty-four children hospitalized with Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia were enrolled. They were divided into the vaginal delivery group and the cesarean delivery group. We compared and analyzed their age of onset, peripheral blood white blood cell count, liver enzymes, chlamydia trachomatis titers, and chest radiograph scores. Seventy-eight (22.7%) were delivered by a cesarean, and 266 (77.3%) were delivered vaginally. There were no statistically significant differences between groups when compared by sex and age (P &gt; 0.05). Copy numbers and white blood cell counts in the peripheral blood of children with Chlamydia trachomatis in respiratory secretions of the vaginal delivery group were significantly higher than those of the cesarean delivery group (P &lt; 0.05). The alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels between groups were not statistically significant. Comparisons of admission chest radiography scores, discharge radiography scores, and score differences showed no statistical differences (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Infants delivered by cesarean comprise approximately one-fifth of those affected. The Chlamydia trachomatis titers and peripheral blood leukocyte counts of the vaginal delivery group were higher than those of the cesarean delivery group. Age of onset, liver enzymes, pulmonary inflammation, and pneumonia absorption were not different between groups. What is Known:   Chlamydia trachomatis is an important pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants.   C. trachomatis is primarily transmitted to infants through the infected mother, resulting in Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia subsequently. What is New:   Vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery can result in Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia transmission; however, cesarean delivery accounts for ~ 20% of cases.   C. trachomatis volume in the respiratory tract and the number of peripheral blood leukocytes in infants delivered vaginally were higher than those in infants delivered by cesarean."

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term ""communityacquired pneumonia"". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Patents were searched using the key term ""community-acquired pneumonia"" from www.google.com/patents, http://espacenet.com, and www. freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS: Generally, viruses, notably respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common cause of community- acquired pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause across all age groups. Other important bacterial causes in children younger than 5 years include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In children 5 years or older, in addition to S. pneumoniae, other important bacterial causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. In the majority of cases, bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably distinguished from each other on clinical grounds. In practice, most children with pneumonia are treated empirically with antibiotics; the choice of which depends on the patient's age and most likely pathogen. Recent patents related to the management of community-acquired pneumonia are discussed. CONCLUSION: In previously healthy children under the age of 5 years, high dose amoxicillin is the treatment of choice. For those with type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives. For children with a non-type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cefixime, cefprozil, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime should be considered. In previously healthy children over the age of 5 years, macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are the drugs of choice."

We sought to investigate whether short-course antibiotic treatment for CAP is associated with favorable clinical outcomes in adult patients. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies comparing the effectiveness and safety between treatment regimens administered for &lt;=6 days and &gt;=7 days. We defined treatment for &lt;=6 days as short-course treatment and treatment for &gt;=7 days as long-course treatment. Twenty-one clinical trials (4,861 clinically evaluable patients) were included, and 19 out of 21 trials were randomized. Clinical cure was similar between the compared groups (4,069 patients, risk ratio [RR] = 0.99 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.97 to 1.01]), irrespective of patient setting (RR = 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.00] for the outpatient setting and RR = 1.00 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.09] for the inpatient setting) or severity of pneumonia (RR = 1.05 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.14]). Also, relapses were similar between the short- and long-course treatment groups (1,923 patients, RR = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.30 to 1.46]). Short-course treatment was associated with fewer serious adverse events (1,923 patients, RR = 0.73 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.97]) and, importantly, resulted in lower mortality than long-course treatment (2,802 patients, RR = 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.82]). In CAP, short-course antibiotic treatment (&lt;=6 days) is as effective as and potentially superior to, in terms of mortality and serious adverse events, longer-course treatment."

Antibiotic management decisions are made on the basis of little available data and without strong specific recommendations in guidelines. METHODS: This was an online survey of paediatric infectious diseases (PID) physicians disseminated by major international professional organisations, examining empiric and targeted antibiotic choice, switch to oral antibiotics and duration of treatment for two hypothetical cases of contrasting severity. RESULTS: This study included 183 responses, mostly from North America, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Increased disease severity was significantly associated with broader-spectrum and combination empiric and targeted antibiotic treatment, empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage and both longer intravenous (IV) and total duration of antibiotic treatment. Empirical MRSA coverage was also associated with local prevalence. Clinical progress was most important for determining the timing of the switch from IV to oral antibiotics. Few respondents chose antibiotics with activity against organisms associated with atypical pneumonia (e.g. Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), and most did not choose agents that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g. clindamycin), even in the case of a severe invasive group A streptococcal infection. Some variation in targeted treatment choices reflected areas of uncertainty, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility breakpoints, comparative effectiveness of anti-staphylococcal penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins for serious S. aureus infections and linezolid and vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This international survey of PID physicians highlights the priority targets for clinical research to improve antibiotic treatment of CAP complicated by empyema. Interventions that might be studied include empirical antibiotic guidelines stratified by case severity, adjunctive empirical use of agents that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g. clindamycin) and approaches to encourage rapid IV-to-oral switch and shorter total antibiotic treatment."

Median number of involved quadrants on chest X-ray was 2 [1-4], with alveolar opacities (n = 61, 75%), interstitial opacities (n = 32, 40%). Extra-pulmonary manifestations were present in 34 (33%) patients. Mechanical ventilation was required for 75 (72%) patients and vasopressors for 41 (39%) patients. ICU length of stay was 16.5 [9.5-30.5] days, and 11 (11%) patients died in the ICU. Compared with SP patients, MP patients had more extensive interstitial pneumonia, fewer pleural effusion, and a lower mortality rate [6 (8%) vs. 17 (22%), p = 0.013]. According MCA analysis, some characteristics at admission could discriminate MP and SP. MP was more often associated with hemolytic anemia, abdominal manifestations, and extensive chest radiograph abnormalities. SP-P was associated with shock, confusion, focal crackles, and focal consolidation. CONCLUSION: In this descriptive study of atypical bacterial pneumonia requiring ICU admission, mortality was 11%. The comparison with SP pneumonia identified clinical, laboratory, and radiographic features that may suggest MP or CP pneumonia."

In 2016, the mortality rate from pneumonia was 16,476 deaths per 100,000, which was an 11% increase from the previous year. The aim of our study was to determine the distribution of the bacterial pathogens causing respiratory symptoms in different age groups over a 10-year period. Between January 2008 and September 2017, 1,861 specimens from 1,664 patients admitted to Dankook University Hospital with respiratory symptoms were examined. We used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect six bacterial pneumonia pathogens: Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We detected bacterial pneumonia pathogens in 1,281 (68.83%) specimens. Of the 1,709 pathogens detected, S. pneumoniae was the most common (48.57%; n = 830) followed by H. influenzae (40.08%; n = 685). Most infections were found among children younger than 10 years (92.69%; n = 1,584). Although S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen detected in all age groups, M. pneumoniae infection increased in prevalence with age (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of co-infection was also high among these patients (31.1%; n = 399), which peaked in 2015 (54.55%; n = 42/77). The prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in Cheonan, along with the proportion of co-infections among patients increased over the 10-year study period. The findings will aid the development of treatment and prevention guidelines."

More than 50% of the adult population worldwide was once infected with C. pneumoniae, but investigations into this topic are insufficient in mainland China. METHODS: Anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM antibodies were detected using micro-immunofluorescence test in serum samples of patients visiting Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2008 and 2017 for routine medical purposes, and the aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the test results. RESULTS: Among 12,050 serum specimens tested for anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM antibodies, the overall prevalence of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies was 86.6%, 87.2% for men and 86.0% for women. Adult men (&gt;20 years) were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG than women (chi2 = 30.32, P = 0.000). 3 to 5 years old patients were observed to have the lowest prevalence of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG, 42.8%, then increased with age, reaching the highest level of 98.6% in patients over 70 years of age. In the 10,434 specimens with C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies, the total geometric mean titer (GMT) for C. pneumoniae IgG was 45.71. Although GMTs were found to be significantly higher among all men than among all women (t = 5.916, P = 0.000), sex difference actually began in patients over 40 years of age and increased in the elderly. In the total 12,050 specimens, 1.2% had anti-C. pneumoniae IgM, 3.3% had anti-C. pneumoniae IgG with titers equal to or greater than 1:512; 0.39% had &gt;=4-fold increasing titers of antibodies in acute and convalescent phase paired samples, and 4.4% were finally confirmed to have acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae. 6 to 10 years old patients were found to have the highest rate of both IgM antibodies (3.9%) and acute antibodies (6.2%) against C. pneumoniae. Acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae were found to be more frequent in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD, 14.0%, chi2 = 20.43, P = 0.000), patients with pneumonia (7.8%, chi2 = 51.87, P = 0.000) and patients with acute respiratory tract infection (12.3%, chi2 = 60.91, P = 0.000) than among all patients (4.4%). Both anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM antibodies should be tested for acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae as testing for either alone will underestimate by a maximum of two-thirds the incidence of acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: More than 86% of Chinese patients on an average were once infected with C. pneumoniae. Adult men had both a higher prevalence and higher levels of antibodies than women. 6 to10 year old patients were found to have the most frequent acute infection of C. pneumoniae. C. pneumoniae is associated with AECOPD, pneumonia and acute respiratory tract infection. Anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM should be tested simultaneously to avoid underestimation of acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae."

We aimed to assess both testing for atypical pathogens and their prevalence in hospitalized patients with CAP worldwide, especially in relation with disease severity. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the GLIMP database, an international, multicentre, point-prevalence study of adult patients admitted for CAP in 222 hospitals across 6 continents in 2015, was performed. The study evaluated frequency of testing for atypical pathogens, including L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and their prevalence. Risk factors for testing and prevalence for atypical pathogens were assessed through univariate analysis. RESULTS: Among 3702 CAP patients 1250 (33.8%) underwent at least one test for atypical pathogens. Testing varies greatly among countries and its frequency was higher in Europe than elsewhere (46.0% vs. 12.7%, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Detection of L. pneumophila urinary antigen was the most common test performed worldwide (32.0%). Patients with severe CAP were less likely to be tested for both atypical pathogens considered together (30.5% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.009) and specifically for legionellosis (28.3% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.003) than the rest of the population. Similarly, L. pneumophila testing was lower in ICU patients. At least one atypical pathogen was isolated in 62 patients (4.7%), including M. pneumoniae (26/251 patients, 10.3%), L. pneumophila (30/1186 patients, 2.5%), and C. pneumoniae (8/228 patients, 3.5%). Patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens were significantly younger, showed less cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic comorbidities in comparison to adult patients hospitalized due to non-atypical pathogen CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for atypical pathogens in patients admitted for CAP in poorly standardized in real life and does not mirror atypical prevalence in different settings. Further evidence on the impact of atypical pathogens, expecially in the low-income countries, is needed to guidelines implementation."

Methods: We conducted a surveillance study for CAP in 30 hospitals of Beijing. Epidemiological data and clinical specimens were systematically collected from enrolled CAP patients. The detection for 11 atypical pathogens [9 respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP)] was performed. Risk factors of severe CAP and death in Hospital were evaluated. Results: A total of 6,008 CAP patients [including 1,071 severe CAP (SCAP)] were enrolled. The overall detection rate of the 11 atypical pathogens was 42.4% among 1,925 child CAP (39.9% among 274 child SCAP), and 25.8% among 4,083 adult CAP (22.8% among 797 adult SCAP). The most frequent atypical pathogen among child SCAP was parainfluenza virus (10.2%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (8.4%). However, the most frequent atypical pathogen among adult SCAP was influenza virus (8.9%) followed by parainfluenza virus (3.8%). Multivariate analyses showed that the important predictors for SCAP were an age &lt;=9 years, an age &gt;=65 years and co-existing diseases. These factors, except an age &lt;=9 years, were also predictors of death in Hospital. None of these 11 atypical pathogens was included as the risk factors of SCAP or death in Hospital. Conclusions: Although these 11 atypical pathogens were the common causes of CAP (including SCAP) among Chinese, they were not observed to increase risks for SCAP or death in Hospital."

Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment."

Fever may be present early but absent by time of presentation to clinic. Increases in X-ray-confirmed pneumonia (XCP) and laboratory-confirmed Cp infections were observed in new soldiers in training at Fort Leonard Wood (FLW), Missouri, early in 2014. These findings prompted a site assistance visit from the U.S. Army Public Health Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, with a review of available data and information to describe the outbreak, and inspections of barracks and training facilities and review of training practices to identify opportunities for interventions to reduce the risk of respiratory disease agent transmission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population was trainee soldiers at FLW in 2013-2014. Data from two acute respiratory disease surveillance systems were studied. A local surveillance system operated by the FLW General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital Preventive Medicine Department tracked weekly chest X-rays taken and the numbers positive for pneumonia. A Naval Health Research Center, San Diego, California, laboratory-based Febrile Respiratory Illness Surveillance Program collected clinical data and nasal, or nasal and pharyngeal swabs, for nucleic acid amplification testing from up to 15 trainees/week with fever and either cough or sore throat. Up to 4 of the 15 specimens could be from afebrile patients with XCP. Specimens were tested for a variety of agents. RESULTS: Monthly rates of XCP rose quickly in 2014 and peaked at 0.9/100 trainees in May. The percentage of the San Diego surveillance system specimens that were positive for Cp also increased quickly in 2014, peaking at 54% in May. During the first half of 2014, the San Diego program studied specimens from 141 ill trainees; 37% (52/141) were positive for Cp, making it the most common organism identified, followed by rhinoviruses (8%), influenza viruses (4%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2%), and adenoviruses (1%). The remaining specimens (48%) were negative for all respiratory pathogens. Only 12% (6/52) of Cp positive patients were febrile. Facilities inspections and review of training practices failed to identify variables that might be contributing to an increased risk of respiratory agent transmission. CONCLUSION: The XCP rate and the percentage of specimens positive for Cp increased in early 2014, peaking in May. Only 12% of trainees with laboratory-confirmed Cp were febrile. Historically, acute respiratory disease surveillance at military training centers focused on febrile diseases, particularly those caused by adenoviruses. With introduction of an adenovirus vaccine in late 2011, respiratory disease rates dropped with only sporadic occurrences of adenovirus-associated disease. In 2012, the San Diego surveillance program began providing data on multiple respiratory disease agents, in addition to adenoviruses and influenza viruses. Since then, Cp, rhinoviruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have frequently been detected in trainees with acute respiratory disease. Respiratory surveillance programs supporting Army training centers should be re-evaluated in this post-adenovirus vaccine era, to include assessment of the fever criterion for selecting patients for study, the value of chest X-ray surveillance and the value of rapidly providing laboratory results to inform provider decisions regarding antibiotic use."

Pathogen-specific clinical symptoms are often lacking, and it is difficult to detect atypical pathogens by culture methods. The use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods enables testing for many pathogens simultaneously in a single analysis. Aim: To determine the role of atypical pathogens in children hospitalized with CAP. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted throughout a 2-year period from August 2015 to September 2017. It included 400 Egyptian children hospitalized with clinical diagnosis of CAP at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Sputum samples were collected from lower respiratory tract of all enrolled patients by mucus trap catheter for identification of Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia by using multiplex real-time PCR. Results: Among the 400 CAP patients enrolled in this study, atypical pathogens were detected in 12/400 (3%) patients. Bordetella pertussis was detected in 2% of cases, and it was responsible for CAP in 8/104 (7.69%) infants in the age stratum &lt;= 4 months; compared with pertussis-negative cases, pertussis-positive cases were younger and incompletely vaccinated (P values were 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1% of cases, all were among the age stratum &gt; 4 months &lt;= 59 months in 4/272 (1.47%) children. Conclusion: In early infancy, Bordetella pertussis causes a significant proportion of hospitalized CAP cases; all were &lt;= 4 months old and incompletely vaccinated. This finding could suggest the role of maternal immunization in developing countries."

Historically, the most common pathogens were Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus. Pediatric patients receiving guideline-adherent therapy experienced fewer ACS-related and all-cause 30-day readmissions compared with those receiving nonadherent therapy. This has not been evaluated in adults. Objectives: The primary objectives were to characterize antibiotic use and pathogens. The secondary objective was to assess the occurrence of readmissions associated with guideline-adherent and clinically appropriate treatment compared with regimens that did not meet those criteria. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted for adults with SCD hospitalized between August 1, 2014, and July 31, 2017, with pneumonia (PNA) or ACS. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Results: A total of 139 patients with 255 hospitalizations were reviewed. Among 41 respiratory cultures, 3 organisms were isolated: Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and budding yeast. Respiratory panels were collected on 121 admissions, with 17 positive for 1 virus; all were negative for Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. There were significantly more ACS-/PNA-related 7-day readmissions from patients on guideline-adherent regimens compared with nonadherent regimens (3.7% vs 0%; P = 0.04). Conclusion and Relevance: These findings challenge existing knowledge regarding the most common pathogens in adults with SCD with ACS or PNA. Routine inclusion of a macrolide may not be necessary. Future studies focused on pathogen characterization with standardized assessment are necessary to determine appropriate empirical therapy in this population."

The study group consisted of 46 hospitalized children aged 1-11 years. The material for research consisted of pharyngeal swabs and samples of blood serum. One hundred and thirty eight pharyngeal swabs were examined for the presence of C. pneumoniae antigen, C. pneumoniae DNA, and for typical pathogens. C. pneumoniae DNA was detected in pharyngeal swabs with nested PCR. Classical microbiological culture was used for detection of typical bacteria. ELISA test were used for detection anti-C. pneumoniae and anti-M. pneumoniae antibodies in the serum. C. pneumoniae DNA was identified in 10.9% of children. Positive culture for typical pathogens was observed in 8.7% of children. Specific anti-C. pneumoniae IgM antibodies were found in 8.7% of children, and IgG and IgA antibodies in 1 child each. Specific anti-M. pneumoniae IgG antibodies were found in 13.1% of children and IgM antibodies in 1 child. We conclude that the underlying bacterial etiology of CAP is rather rarely conclusively confirmed in children. Nonetheless, determining the etiology of CAP is essential for the choice of treatment to optimize the use and effectiveness of antimicrobials and to avoid adverse effect. Due to considerable variations in the power of detection of the type of atypical bacteria causing CAP, the search for the optimum diagnostic methods continues."

However, the definite etiology of CAP often remains unresolved, suggesting that unknown agents of pneumonia remain to be identified. The recently discovered members of the order Chlamydiales, Chlamydia-related bacteria (CRB), are considered as possible emerging agents of CAP. Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is the most studied candidate. It survives and replicates inside free-living amoeba, which it might potentially use as a vehicle to infect animals and humans. A Mycoplasma pneumoniae outbreak was observed in Kymenlaakso region in Southeastern Finland during August 2017-January 2018. We determined the occurrence of Chlamydiales bacteria and their natural host, free-living amoeba in respiratory specimens collected during this outbreak with molecular methods. Altogether, 22/278 (7.9%) of the samples contained Chlamydiales DNA. By sequence analysis, majority of the CRBs detected were members of the Parachlamydiaceae family. Amoebal DNA was not detected within the sample material. Our study further proposes that Parachlamydiaceae could be a potential agent causing atypical CAP in children and adolescents."

Basic information and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from cases in line with the inclusion criteria. Multiplex RT-PCR and bacterial cultures were performed to detect the respiratory pathogens. Results: A total of 806 individuals were enrolled from 2015 to 2017. Respiratory pathogens were identified in 73.45% (592/806) of the cases, with the virus detection rate as 66.75% (538/806). It was found that the major respiratory pathogens for virus detection were influenza A in 326 (40.45%), influenza B in 116 (14.39%), rhinovirus/enterovirus in 39 (4.84%) of the cases. The overall detection rate of bacteria was 16.13% (130/806), including Klebsiella pneumoniae in 90 (11.17%) cases, Staphylococcus Aureus in 46 (5.71%) cases. Other kind of bacteria were not detected in our study. The detection rates on Mycoplasma pneumoniae was 5.33% (43/806) and on Chlamydia pneumonia was 0.37% (3/806). Co-infection with multiple pathogens was detected in 18.61% (150/806) of the cases, including 135 with double infection (accounting for 90.00%), 14 with triple infection and 1 with quadruple infection (accounted for 9.33% and 0.67%, respectively).

For syndromic diagnosis, several multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed for clinics, of which SureX 13 Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex Kit (ResP) can simultaneously detect 13 pathogens directly from airway secretion specimens. The organisms identified are influenza virus A, influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009), influenza virus A H3N2, influenza virus B, adenovirus, boca virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia. METHODS: This study provides performance evaluation data of this assay by comparing with pathogen-specific PCRs from oropharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: Ten pathogens were detected in this assay, of which rhinovirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009) were the most common.

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests. Our patient showed remarkable clinical and laboratory improvement with the therapy mentioned above."

Available reviews do not address the association of Chlamydophila pneumoniae pneumonia with skin eruptions. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue. The National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases were employed. SUMMARY: In two reports, skin lesions and especially urticaria were more common (p < 0.05) in atypical pneumonia caused by C. pneumoniae as compared with M. pneumoniae. We found 47 patients (<18 years, n = 16; >=18 years, n = 31) affected by a C. pneumoniae atypical pneumonia, which was associated with erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme minus, erythema multiforme majus, isolated mucositis, or cutaneous vasculitis. We also found the case of a boy with C. pneumoniae pneumonia and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. We did not find any case of C. pneumoniae respiratory infection associated with either Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta Mucha-Habermann, or varicella-like skin eruptions."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:32226119TITLE:Bacterial pathogens were detected from human exhaled breath using a novel protocol.ABSTRACT:It is generally believed that influenza outbreak is associated with breath-borne transmission of viruses, however relevant evidence is little for that of respiratory bacterial infections. On another front, point-of-care infection diagnostic methods at the bedside are significantly lacking. Here, we used a newly developed protocol of integrating an exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection device (PKU BioScreen) and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to investigate what bacterial pathogens can be directly exhaled out from humans. Exhaled breath condensates were collected from human subjects with respiratory infection symptoms at Peking University 3rd hospital using the BioScreen. The screened bacterial pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Stphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma Pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results were further compared and validated using throat swabs from the same patients by a PCR method. Here, human bacterial pathogens such as H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA were detected in exhaled breath using the developed protocol that integrates the EBC collection and LAMP. For the patients recruited from the hospital, seven types of pathogens were detected from 36.5% of them, and for the remaining subjects none of those screened bacterial pathogens was detected. Importantly, some super resistant bacteria such as MRSA were detected from the exhaled breath, suggesting that breathing might be also an important bacterial transmission route. Results from throat swabs showed that 36.2% of the subjects were found to be infected with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia, S. aureus and MRSA. For the EBC samples, 33.3% were found to be infected with MRSA, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Depending on the initial pathogen load in the sample, the entire protocol (EBC-LAMP) only takes 20-60 min to complete for a respiratory infection diagnosis. For different detection methods and pathogens, the agreements between the EBC and throat swabs from the same patients were found to range from 35% to 65%. Here, we have detected several bacterial pathogens including MRSA from exhaled breath, and the developed protocol could be very useful for the bedside pathogen screening particularly in remote areas where resources are significantly limited or prohibited."

Here, we report the first case of recurrent rash, mucositis, and conjunctivitis involving Mycoplasma pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae that fits under the criteria of what is currently defined as MIRM. CASE PRESENTATION: A patient aged 12 years with a history of recurrent aphthous ulcers presented in 2013 with worsening oral lesions, conjunctivitis, and vesicular rash. Her respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel was positive for M. pneumoniae. She was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) secondary to M. pneumoniae and treated with a macrolide, acyclovir, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The same patient returned 3 years later with an identical constellation of symptoms, at which time her PCR was positive for C. pneumoniae. In addition to IVIG and a macrolide, a corticosteroid treatment was administered. DISCUSSION: Here, we present the case of a pediatric patient with a recurrence of mucocutaneous disease that is more consistent with MIRM than the proposed SJS or erythema multiforme (EM) documented via histology. Our patient's symptoms were controlled with azithromycin and IVIG and, in the second episode, with corticosteroids as well. This case adds to that of Mayor-Ibarguren et al, providing further evidence that C. pneumonia may also be a trigger for MIRM. Patients will benefit from expanding the definition of MIRM, as the pathogenesis differs from SJS and EM and could result in more specific treatment options."

Implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) gives a promising new tool for diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of severe psittacosis pneumonia is described to provide physicians with a better understanding and to highlight the rarity and severity of severe psittacosis pneumonia. METHODS: Nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia were diagnosed using mNGS. Retrospective analysis of the data on disease progression, new diagnosis tool, treatments, and outcomes, and the findings were summarised. RESULTS: Frequent symptoms included chills and remittent fever (100%), cough and hypodynamia (100%), and headache and myalgia (77.8%). All patients were severe psittacosis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, accompanied by sepsis in 6/9 patients. mNGS takes 48-72 h to provide the results, and help to identify diagnosis of psittacosis. Laboratory data showed normal or slightly increased leucocytes, neutrophils, and procalcitonin but high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography revealed air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which began in the upper lobe of one lung, and spread to both lungs, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. One patient died because of secondary infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the other eight patients experienced complete recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in diagnosis of psittacosis. Severe psittacosis pneumonia responds well to the timely use of appropriate antibiotics."

Study design: A retrospective, single-centre cohort study. All children aged 2 months-18 years with presumed respiratory infection who were admitted to a tertiary hospital paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) between September 2015 and October 2016 were eligible. Subjects were grouped by clinical syndrome (viral respiratory infection, asthma exacerbation, undifferentiated/uncomplicated pneumonia, pneumonia complicated by effusion/empyema and 'other'). All subjects had nasopharyngeal swabs tested for respiratory viruses, M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Results: There were 221 subjects; the median age was 3.1 years; 44% were female; and 78% had medical comorbidities. The majority (75%) was treated with antibiotics, most often ceftriaxone (90% of treated children). Those with any pneumonia were significantly less likely to have a respiratory virus identified in their nasopharynges and had significantly higher C reactive protein (CRP) values than those in the viral infection and asthma groups. There were 10 subjects in whom M. pneumoniae was detected (4.5%, 95% CI 2.2% to 8.2%). Mycoplasma-positive children were older (difference 3.5 years, 95% CI 0.66 to 6.4 years) and had fewer viral coinfections (30% compared with 69%, p=0.02). The prevalence of Mycoplasma infection in children aged >5 years with any pneumonia was 13.2% (95%CI 4.4% to 28%). Conclusions: The majority of participants had respiratory viruses detected and were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Differences in CRP and viral prevalence were observed between children with different infection syndrome types. M. pneumoniae infection was not rare in school-aged children with pneumonia admitted to the PICU. Attention to antibiotic treatment and rapid diagnostic testing for Mycoplasma in older, critically ill children should be considered to optimise management and avert morbidity and mortality from respiratory infection."

Data on the impact of the underlying pathogens are still controversial. Samples from the upper (n = 322) and lower RT (n = 169) were collected from 136 children and 355 adults; 225 among them have been immunocompromised patients. Exclusion criteria were presence of relevant cultivable microorganisms, C-reactive protein > 20 mg/dl, or procalcitonin > 2.0 ng/ml. Samples were tested by PCR for the presence of herpesviruses (HSV-1/-2; VZV; CMV; HHV6; EBV), adenoviruses, bocaviruses, entero-/rhinoviruses (HRV), parechoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses (IV), parainfluenza viruses as well as for pneumoviruses (HMPV and RSV), and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M.p.; Chlamydia pneumoniae, C.p.). Viral/bacterial genome equivalents were detected in more than two-thirds of specimens. Under immunosuppression, herpesviruses (EBV 30.9%/14.6%, p < 0.001; CMV 19.6%/7.9%, p < 0.001; HSV-1: 14.2%/7.1%, p = 0.012) were frequently observed, mainly through their reactivation in adults. Immunocompromised adults tended to present a higher RSV prevalence (6.4%/2.4%, p = 0.078). Immunocompetent patients were more frequently tested positive for IV (15.0%/5.8%, p = 0.001) and M.p. (6.4%/0.4%, p < 0.001), probably biased due to the influenza pandemic of 2009 and an M.p. epidemic in 2011. About 41.8% of samples were positive for a single pathogen, and among them EBV (19.9%) was most prevalent followed by HRV (18.2%) and IV (16.6%). HSV-2 and C.p. were not found. Marked seasonal effects were observed for HRV, IV, and RSV. Differences in pathogen prevalence were demonstrated between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The exact contribution of some herpesviruses to the development of RTI remains unclear."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia pneumoniaeID:32517424TITLE:Current perspectives on atypical pneumonia in children.ABSTRACT:The major pathogens that cause atypical pneumonia are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae is common in children and presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting disease. CAP due to L. pneumophila is very rare in children and progresses rapidly, with fatal outcomes if not treated early. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila have no cell walls; therefore, they do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics. Accordingly, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are the treatments of choice for atypical pneumonia. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics used in children because of their low minimum inhibitory concentrations and high safety. The incidence of pneumonia caused by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae that harbors point mutations has been increasing since 2000, particularly in Korea, Japan, and China. The marked increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MRMP) is partly attributed to the excessive use of macrolides. MRMP does not always lead to clinical nonresponsiveness to macrolides. Furthermore, severe complicated MRMP responds to corticosteroids without requiring a change in antibiotic. This implies that the hyper-inflammatory status of the host can induce clinically refractory pneumonia regardless of mutation. Empirical macrolide therapy in children with mild to moderate CAP, particularly during periods without M. pneumoniae epidemics, may not provide additional benefits over beta-lactam monotherapy and can increase the risk of MRMP."

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out with samples from 685 adults who were admitted with CAP and 108 non-CAP control patients. Atypical pathogens and respiratory viruses in serum were detected using the Pneumoslide IgM test from Vircell, Spain. All patients were divided into 6 groups according to age: 18-24, 25-44, 45-59, 60-74, 75-89, and >90. RESULTS: The total positive rate of CAP was 35.4%, which was highest in the 18-24 age group (P < .05). The highest positive rate, 17.11%, was observed for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The mean age of MP-infected patients was higher than that of the controls (P < .05). The positive rates for influenza B (INFB), Legionella pneumophila (LP1), Coxiella burnetii (COX), influenza A (INFA), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), and adenovirus (ADV) were 5.56%, 3.07%, 2.63%, 2.34%, 1.90%, 1.61, 0.88%, and 0.29%, respectively. There were 4.37% of patients with CAP having multiple infections. The main symptoms observed in the 685 CAP patients were cough and sputum production, in 78.4% and 67.4%. Fever was followed by 54% of CAP patients. Dyspnea (39.1%), anorexia (36.8%), increased thirst (26.7%), chills (18.7), headache (14.6%), and nausea (13.1%) were also frequently observed in the CAP patients.

Under these circumstances, the role of Chlamydophila pneumoniae as a pathogen that causes CAP also needs to be reviewed. METHODS: We reviewed articles that contained data on the frequency of identification of C. pneumoniae pneumonia as a causative pathogen for CAP. The articles were identified by performing a search in PubMed with the keywords ""community-acquired pneumonia"" and ""pathogen"". RESULTS: Sixty-three articles were identified. The reviewed articles demonstrated that the rates of identification of C. pneumoniae as the causative pathogen for CAP were significantly lower in assessments based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods than in those based on serological methods. In some studies, it was possible to compare both serological and PCR methods directly using the same set of samples. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PCR methods, including multiplex PCR assays, has revealed that C. pneumoniae may play a limited role as a pathogen for CAP."

Multiple pathogens can cause acute respiratory infections. A 2-year survey of hospitalized children was conducted to understand the epidemic situation, seasonal spread of pathogens and the improvement of clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in Huzhou, China. METHODS: From September 2017 to August 2019, 3121 nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections were collected, and real-time PCR was used to detect various pathogens. Then, pathogen profiles, frequency and seasonality were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 3121 specimens, 14.45% (451/3121) were positive for at least one pathogen. Of the single-pathogen infections, RSV (45.61%, 182/399) was the most frequent pathogen, followed by PIVs (14.79%, 59/399), ADV (14.54%, 58/399), MP (10.78%, 43/399), and IAV (5.26%, 21/399). Of the 52 coinfections, RSV + PIVs viruses were predominantly identified and accounted for 40.38% (21/52) of cases. RSV was the most frequent pathogen in all four groups. The highest positive rate of the pathogens occurred in the winter (21.26%), followed by autumn (14.98%), the summer (14.11%) and the spring (12.25%). CONCLUSION: Viruses are the main pathogens in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Huzhou city, Zhejiang Province, China.

We conducted an annual national survey of Japanese children to screen them for C. pneumoniae infections during the M. pneumoniae epidemic season. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from children aged 0-15 years with suspected acute lower respiratory tract infection due to atypical pathogens, at 85 medical facilities in Japan from June 2008 to March 2018. Specimens were tested for infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Of 5002 specimens tested, 1822 (36.5%) were positive for M. pneumoniae alone, 42 (0.8%) were positive for C. pneumoniae alone, and 20 (0.4%) were positive for both organisms. In children with C. pneumoniae infection, the median C. pneumoniae DNA copy number was higher in those with single infections than in those with M. pneumoniae coinfection (p = 0.08); however it did not differ significantly according to whether the children had received antibiotics prior to sample collection (p = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. pneumoniae infection was substantially lower than that of M. pneumoniae infection during the study period. The change in prevalence of C. pneumoniae was not influenced by that of M. pneumoniae. Children with single C. pneumoniae infection are likely to have had C. pneumoniae infection, while those with coinfection are likely to have been C. pneumoniae carriers."

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. RESULTS: Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679-0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310-9.353, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary."

Patients and Methods: We included 250 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. RT-PCR was used to detect influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial viruses. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect IgM antibodies for adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the serum of patients. Based on these results, we divided the patients into two groups, the simple SARS-CoV-2-infected group and the coinfected SARS-COV-2 group. Coinfected patients were then further categorized as having a coinfection of viral pathogen (CoIV) or coinfection of atypical bacterial pathogen (CoIaB). Results: No statistically significant differences were found in age, gender, the time taken to return negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, length of hospital stays, and mortality between the simple SARS-CoV-2 infection group and the coinfection group. Of the 250 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 39 (15.6%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen in addition to SARS-CoV-2. A third of these pathogens were detected as early as the 1st week after symptom onset and another third were identified after more than three weeks. The most detected CAP pathogen was C. pneumoniae (5.2%), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4.8%), M. pneumoniae (4.4%) and adenovirus (2.8%). Patients coinfected with viral pathogens (CoIV) (n=18) had longer hospital stays when compared to patients coinfected with atypical bacterial pathogens (CoIaB) (n=21). Except for one fatality, the remaining 38 coinfected patients all recovered with favourable outcomes. Conclusion: Coinfections in COVID-19 patients are common. The coinfecting pathogens can be detected at variable intervals during COVID-19 disease course and remain an important consideration in targeted treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients."

These agents are mostly associated with infection in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these pathogens among patients with CAP attending outpatient clinics in Tehran. A cross-sectional study was carried out of 150 patients attending to educational hospitals in Tehran with CAP. M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected by PCR assay, targeting the P1 adhesion gene, macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively from throat swabs obtained from each patient. A total of 86 (57.3%) of 150 patients were women; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 35-65 years). M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 37 (24.7%), 25 (16.7%) and 11 (7.3%) patients respectively; of these, 66 patients (44%) were infected at least by one of these three pathogens. The frequency of L. pneumophila was significantly higher among patients over 60 years old (p 0.03). Coinfection was detected in seven patients (4.7%); six were infected by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and only one was infected by L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent agent of atypical CAP, and L. pneumophila was more likely to infect elderly rather than younger people. Further studies on the prevalence of CAP and its aetiologic agents are needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CAP patients."

METHODS: The study comprised 449 lung cancer patients and 512 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. All participants provided a 5 ml fasting peripheral venous blood sample for testing Cpn-specific IgG and IgA by using micro-immunofluorescence. Besides analyzing the associations between Cpn and lung cancer, combined effect analysis, logistic regression, and the Excel table made by Andersson were used to analyze the combined and interaction effects of Cpn and environmental factors on lung cancer. RESULTS: Compared to those with no evidence of serum Cpn IgA or Cpn IgG, those with both Cpn IgG+ and IgA+ had 2.00 times the risk (95% CI: 1.34-3.00) of developing lung cancer. Cpn IgG+ or IgA+ was associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer among smokers; the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.79 (95% CI: 1.10-2.91) and 2.27 (95% CI: 1.38-3.72), respectively. Those exposed to passive smoking with Cpn IgG+ or IgA+ also showed an increased risk of lung cancer; the adjusted OR was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.20-2.77) or 1.87 (95% CI: 1.22-2.87), respectively. Similar results were also observed among alcohol drinkers. Multiplicative and additive interactions were not observed between Cpn infection and environmental factors. The combined effects of Cpn IgG+ or IgA+ with smoking, passive smoking, and family history of cancer on lung cancer were determined. CONCLUSION: Cpn infection is potentially associated with primary lung cancer in the Chinese Han population and has combined effects with smoking, passive smoking, and family history of cancer."

Evidence indicates that Bordetella pertussis has an important role in the aetiology of LRTI. We aimed to study the association between B. pertussis and other respiratory pathogens in children hospitalised with severe LRTI, and to assess clinical relevance of co-detection. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and induced sputa (IS) were tested with a B. pertussis specific PCR; additionally, IS was tested for other pathogens using a multiplex PCR. We included 454 children, median age 8 months (IQR 4-18), 31 (7%) of whom tested positive for B. pertussis. Children with B. pertussis had more bacterial pathogens detected (3 versus 2; P < 0.001). While B. pertussis showed no association with most pathogens, it was independently associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and parainfluenza viruses with adjusted risk ratios of 4.01 (1.03-15.64), 4.17 (1.42-12.27) and 2.13 (1.03-4.55), respectively. There was a consistent increased risk of severe disease with B. pertussis. Patterns indicated even higher risks when B. pertussis was co-detected with any of the three organisms although not statistically significant. Improving vaccine coverage against B. pertussis would impact not only the incidence of pertussis but also that of severe LRTI generally."

METHODS: Between February 2013 and February 2015, 107 patients were analyzed. Sixty-nine comprised the inpatient and 38 comprised the outpatient treatment group. RESULTS: When non-specific culture results were taken into consideration only, a causative organism could be detected in 46.7% of the patients. The detection rate increased to 85.1% with the additional use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test and culture methods. More than one causative agent was responsible for COPD exacerbation in 53.3% of patients: two agents in 37.3%, three agents in 15%, and four agents in 0.9%. H.influenzae was detected in 63 (58.9%) patients, S.pneumoniae in 57 (53.2%), P.aeruginosa in 15 (14.0%) and L.pneumophila in 11 (10%). L.pneumophila was the more commonly isolated agent in the inpatient group (p=0.002).Patients receiving continuous oxygen therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have an exacerbation associated with P.aeruginosa (p=0.008 and p=0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: The additional use of DFA for Legionella and multiplex PCR in combination with non-specific microbiological culturing methods greatly improves the ability to identify infectious agents in acute exacerbations of COPD. There should be a high index of suspicion for P.aeruginosa as a causative organism, particularly in subjects receiving continuous oxygen therapy and/or using NIV and L.pneumophilia should certainly be taken into consideration in severe COPD exacerbations."

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury. METHODS: In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases). RESULTS: We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase >=5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to >=1.5 times baseline or increase by >=27 mumol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases.

Few reports examined the involvement of this bacterium in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Jordan. This study investigates for the first time the role of C. pneumoniae in the establishment of CAP among nationals residing the southern part of Jordan. Materials and Methods: Nasopharyngeal and sera samples were collected from 70 hospitalised CAP patients and 63 healthy controls from Al-Karak Governorate and examined using the microimmunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction techniques. The overall prevalence of C. pneumoniae infection was estimated by detecting the chlamydial immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at a titre of 1:16. Rate of acute infection was estimated by detecting chlamydial DNA in nasopharyngeal samples and IgG and IgM at titres of 1:512 and 1:16, respectively. Results: A higher overall seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae IgG was detected in CAP patients than controls (44.3% vs. 30.2%). The rate of acute infection in the entire CAP patients, based on IgG titre of 1:512, was 7.14% compared to 1.58% in the controls. Approximately, three-fold increase in the rate of acute infection was observed in CAP cases, seropositive at IgG titre of 1:16, compared to seropositive controls (16.1% vs. 5.3%). Interestingly, chlamydial IgM antibodies were detectable in 27.1% compared to only 3.2% of the controls. The presence of chlamydial nucleic acids was confirmed in 40% of CAP patients and in 7.9% of controls. Conclusions: The present findings clearly suggest a role of C. pneumoniae in the aetiology of CAP in Southern Jordan. However, coinfections with other respiratory pathogens should not be excluded."

METHODS: In this 1.5-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of mNGS of BALF for identifying pathogens of SCAP in hospitalized adults, comparing it with other laboratory methods. RESULTS: Of 329 SCAP adults, a microbial etiology was established in 304 cases (92.4%). The overall microbial yield was 90.3% for mNGS versus 39.5% for other methods (P < 0.05). The most frequently detected pathogens in immunocompetent patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.8%), rhinovirus (9.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.7%), and Chlamydia psittaci (8.0%), while in immunocompromised patients they were Pneumocystis jirovecii (44.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%). Notably, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified from two patients solely by mNGS in January 2020; uncommon pathogens including Orientia tsutsugamushi and Nocardia otitidiscaviarum were identified from one patient, respectively. Furthermore, mixed infections were detected in 56.8% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high microbial detection rate was achieved in SCAP adults using mNGS testing of BALF. The most frequently detected pathogens of SCAP differed between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. mNGS testing may be an powerful tool for early identification of potential pathogens for SCAP to initiate a precise antimicrobial therapy."

We report the case of a 2 years and 9-month-old male child admitted with prolonged fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath for which he underwent symptomatic treatment. The laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers and the thoracic radiography revealed pleural effusion raising the suspicion of inferior right pneumonia. Although we the initial evolution was favorable being treated with 3rd class cephalosporin and Oxacillin, on the 8th day of admission the fever and the acute phase reactants levels increased as well as the quantity of the pleural effusion, requiring surgical drainage. We ruled out lung tuberculosis, but we identified positive IgM for both MP and CP. Based on these findings we changed the antibiotic therapy on Levofloxacin for 10 days with favorable evolution. MP and CP are two atypical pathogen that are difficult to be diagnosed due to their slow-growing pattern. Despite their self-limiting feature, the association between them might carry a vital risk in small children, especially in the lack of a proper and timely diagnosis."

This project aimed to explore their impact on bacterial microbiota diversity over time in CF children. METHODS: Sixty-one children enrolled in the MUCOVIB multicentre prospective cohort provided 746 samples, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputa which were analysed using culture, specific real-time qPCRs and 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomics. RESULTS: Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 3) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 1) were prospectively documented in 6.6% of CF children. Microbiota alpha-diversity in children with a documented C. pneumoniae was highly variable, similarly to children infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The transition from routine follow-up visits to pulmonary exacerbation (n = 17) yielded variable changes in diversity indexes with some extreme loss of diversity. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of C. pneumoniae detection supports the need for regular screenings in CF patients. A minor impact of C. pneumoniae on the microbial community structure was documented, likely due to a limited sample size and high inter-individual diversity, stressing the need for larger-scale investigations. Although detected in a single patient, M. pneumoniae should also be considered as a possible aetiology of lung infection in CF subjects."

Physicians may overprescribe antimicrobials owing to the concern of bacterial infections, including those because of atypical pathogens. We investigated the accuracy of clinical predictions concerning atypical pathogen infections. Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented with a fever and cough in outpatient clinics between December 2016 and August 2018. After taking a history and performing physical examinations, physicians predicted the possibility of respiratory infections because of atypical pathogens. Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: >=50%, intermediate: 20% >= and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. Results: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3-39.2) were associated with the detections. Atypical pathogens were detected in 32.3% of high-probability cases (10/31), while atypical pathogens were only detected in 8.8% of intermediate-probability cases (8/91) and 3.4% of low-probability cases (3/88) (P < .001).

The objectives of this study were first to evaluate the prevalence of pathogens associated to these episodes by combining conventional bacteriology and multiplex viral and bacterial PCR assays in sputum specimens, and second to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) value and clinical outcome could be influenced by the type of microbial agent(s) recovered from these samples. A cohort of 84 Tunisian patients hospitalized at the emergency room for AECOPD was investigated prospectively for the semi-quantitative detection of bacteria by conventional culture (the threshold of positivity was of 107 CFU/ml) and for the detection of viral genome and DNA of atypical bacteria by quantitative PCR using two commercial multiplex respiratory kits (Seegene and Fast-track). The two kits exhibited very similar performances although the Seegene assay was a bit more sensitive. A large number and variety of pathogens were recovered from the sputum samples of these 84 patients, including 15 conventional bacteria, one Chlamydia pneumoniae and 63 respiratory viruses, the most prevalent being rhinoviruses (n = 33) and influenza viruses (n = 13). From complete results available for 74 patients, the presence of bacteria was significantly associated with risk of recurrence at 6 and 12 months post-infection. The combination of these different markers appears useful for delineating correctly the antimicrobial treatment and for initiating a long-term surveillance in those patients with high risk of recurrent exacerbation episodes. A prospective study is required for confirming the benefits of this strategy aimed at improving the stewardship of antibiotics."

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

The most common atypical pathogens are Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae; others include Legionella species, Chlamydia psittaci and viruses such as influenza, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Infection rates for these agents are difficult to determine because many clinicians and investigators do not routinely test for them, but reported rates are in the range of up to 8% (for C pneumoniae) and 15% to 20% (M pneumoniae) of all cases of pneumonia. Diagnostic testing is very difficult because most of these agents cannot be easily cultured. Diagnosis relies on either high acute antibody titres (quickly available but not very accurate) or paired serology samples (more accurate but requires at least a week). While rapid identification using automated polymerase chain reaction testing may be possible in the future, current management is based largely on empirical treatment."

METHODS: Over 12 months the clinical findings and severity of pneumonia were recorded prospectively. Sputum, blood, serum and urine samples were collected for diagnostic testing. Management was supervised by the admitting medical team. Subjects were followed-up six weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-five patients met the entry criteria of whom 20 died, including five who had Legionella infection. M pneumoniae (16%) infection was more often of mild/moderate severity (95%), occurred in a younger age group (mean age 31.4 years, p=0.002), with more frequent myalgia and headache. The length of hospital stay was shorter and clearing of chest radiograph and return to normal activity occurred more rapidly in this group of patients. Legionellosis was common as judged by culture and serological testing (26 cases, 11%) and a further 22 cases were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Legionella infection was not distinguishable clinically from other pneumonias. C pneumoniae was uncommon (8 cases, 3%). C burnetti and C psittaci were not identified in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Some cases of pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be identified at presentation, however pneumonia due to Legionella is not distinguishable on clinical grounds. Development of molecular diagnostic techniques may enable therapy to be directed against specific organisms earlier in the course of the disease."

METHODS: Oligonucleotide primers for the amplification of the DNA of these three organisms were optimised for use in combination in the same reaction. PCR products were detected by hybridisation with pooled internal probes using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Those with positive signals were further differentiated using species specific probes. Quality of DNA extraction and PCR inhibition were controlled by amplification of a human mitochondrial gene. A panel of 53 respiratory samples with known results was evaluated blindly. This was followed by a retrospective study on sputa collected from 244 patients with suspected community acquired pneumonia. RESULTS: The multiplex assay had a lower sensitivity than PCR with individual primers by about one log. The resultant sensitivity was considered acceptable for diagnostic use. Of the panel of 53 samples, nine of 11 M pneumoniae, 11 of 11 C pneumoniae, six of seven C psittaci, and 24 of 24 negative samples were correctly identified. Of the 244 patients with pneumonia, seven (2.9%) had detectable M pneumoniae, six (2.5%) had C pneumoniae, and one (0.4%) had C psittaci. The case notes from 11 patients were studied. The PCR finding was of possible significance in at least eight of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This multiplex PCR assay has the potential to be used as a diagnostic and epidemiological tool. Further prospective studies are needed to establish its clinical value."

Between April 1996 and March 1997, blood and sputum samples were collected for culture. Throat swabs were obtained for isolation of viruses and for detection of antigens of Chlamydia pneumoniae, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. Antibodies against Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus were tested in serum samples. Two hundred eleven patients were included in the study; paired sera were available from 152 patients. Blood culture was positive in 23 (10.9%) patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae being the bacterium isolated most frequently. A fourfold or greater rise or fall in the Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG and/or IgM antibody titre was found in 20 (9.5%) patients and a high antibody titre (&gt; or = 1:512) in the first and/or the second serum sample in 18 (18.5%) patients. Antibodies confirming acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were found in 12 (5.7%) patients, Legionella spp. in six (2.8%), Chlamydia psittaci in two and Coxiella burnetii in one. Three patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. Only two patients had a virus present in the throat swab (adenovirus in one patient and echovirus in the other), and in nine patients, viral antigen was detected. Acute viral infection was confirmed in 51 (24.1%) patients. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 84 (39.8%) patients, 23 of whom had concurrent viral infection.

We described the chest radiographs of three kinds of pneumonia cases: 46 cases of C. pneumoniae pneumonia, 39 cases of C. psittaci pneumonia, and 131 cases of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Radiographic shadows were categorized into main shadows and sub-shadows. The main shadows are classified from the viewpoint of the characteristics; air space consolidation(AS), ground-glass opacity(GG), reticular shadow(RS), bronchopneumonia(BP), and small nodular shadows (SN). The size, the site, and the number of the main shadows were also analyzed. In comparison among the three pneumonias, BP was the most frequent in M. pneumoniae pneumonia (0.40/case). AS predominated in C. pneumoniae pneumonia (0.67/case), and GG in C. psittaci pneumonia (0.62/case). The number of main shadows was equal, about 1.4/case in three pneumonias. Large shadows were less frequent in M. pneumoniae pneumonia than C. pneumoniae pneumonia (p = 0.02) and C. psittaci pneumonia (p = 0.01). Main shadows were more frequent in the outer zone in M. pneumoniae pneumonia than C. psittaci pneumonia (p = 0.01), and in the middle zone in C. psittaci pneumonia than in M. pneumoniae pneumonia (p = 0.02). Cases with bilateral main shadows were less common in M. pneumoniae pneumonia (9%) than C. pneumoniae pneumonia(33%, p = 0.001) and C. psittaci pneumonia(30%, p = 0.005). Thickening of bronchovascular bundles as a sub-shadow was most frequently noted in M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Some differences among the three atypical pneumonias were seen in the chest radiograph. However, no specific findings of C. pneumoniae pneumonia were shown radiographically in this study."

The proportions of patients with these infections who had an elevated GOT or GPT were not significantly different. Maximum body temperature was higher in M. pn pneumonia than in C. pn pneumonia (p = 0.003). Purulent sputa were seen in 44% of C. pn pneumonia cases and 50% of M. pn pneumonia cases, and these rates were higher than that of 13% in C. ps pneumonia cases (p = 0.002, p = 0.004). Dyspnea and anorexia symptoms were the most frequent in C. pn pneumonia cases (24% and 29%, respectively, the highest of all three pneumonias). There were clinical differences between C. pn pneumonia and the other two atypical pneumonias.

Laboratory tests showed an important inflammatory response, mild renal failure and coagulation disorders. On admission, the chest X-Ray and the cerebrospinal fluid were normal. He rapidly developed shock, acute abdomen, oxygenodependency, pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusion. No improvement was observed after 48 hours of cefotaxime therapy. History revealed the presence of two parrots at home. Treatment by intravenous clarithromycin was therefore initiated. Serology for Chlamydia psittaci was strongly positive. All symptoms disappeared a few days later. CONCLUSION: The case reported was particular for two reasons: severe disease with multi-organ involvement and young age of the patient.

Here we present the case history of a patient with C. pneumoniae community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who subsequently developed a ReA and a cutaneous vasculitis. A 45-year-old HLA B27 negative male developed an asymmetric and additive arthritis and a cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgM and complement papillary deposition along hypodermic vessel walls about three weeks after the onset of respiratory symptoms. The diagnosis of chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection was based on serology and PCR. Cultural and serological investigations for other infectious agents commonly involved in ReA were negative. This is the first report on the occurrence of two immune-based complications, associated to Chlamydia pneumoniae infection. Therefore, since this infection is very common in our population, although often asymptomatic, should be systematically considered as a common causative agent of ReA and of vasculitis."

Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria in the guideline were 70.4% and 91.8%, respectively. High accordance was recognized in patients under 60 years old with atypical pneumonia. Items in the criteria that included subjective factors were considered inassessable. We found that the differentiation of pneumonias in the guideline is useful for the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia among younger patients, but it should be concise and objective. We therefore propose that the criteria would be more effective if they consisted of only 4 items: age under 60 years, no underlying disorders, presence of stubborn dry cough, and normal peripheral white blood cell count."

However, there has been no comprehensive study of the role of Chlamydia species (C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci (avian and feline strains) and C. pecorum) as a cause of CAP. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci and C. pecorum as causes of CAP. A prospective cohort observational study of CAP was conducted at 15 teaching centres in eight Canadian provinces between January 1996-October 1997. Acute (n=539) and convalescent (n=272) serum samples were obtained for determination of antibody titres to C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci, C. pecorum, C. trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila serogroups I-VI, Streptococcus pneumoniae and various respiratory viruses. Twelve of 539 (2.2%) patients had acute C. pneumoniae pneumonia and an additional 32 (5.9%) had possible acute infection. C. pneumoniae was the sole pathogen in 16 of 42 (38.1%) of these patients. The most common copathogens were S. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus type A. C. pneumoniae pneumonia patients were older and more likely to show congestive heart failure compared to bacteraemic S. pneumoniae patients. The latter had a lower mean diastolic blood pressure, a higher white blood cell count and a lower arterial carbon dioxide tension. Two patients had antibody titres suggestive of recent infection with the feline strain of C. psittaci. Although numerically Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia, no distinctive clinical features associated with this pathogen were detected in the present study. Feline Chlamydia psittaci may cause a few cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Avian Chlamydia psittaci should be considered only if there is a compatible epidemiological history."

The criteria of bacterial pneumonia included positive blood and/or sputum cultures and negative serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Coxiella burnetii. The data collected included demographics, chronic diseases, pre- and post-hospitalization course of pneumonia, clinical data on admission and laboratory findings. Descriptive statistical analysis, involving numerous variables, was followed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Two different situations, one including demographic data and information on the pre-hospitalization course of pneumonia, and another based on clinical information on admission and on laboratory results, were modeled using multivariate logistic regression. Several variables selected from these two models were incorporated into the third model, and the following four variables were found to have the highest predictive value of C. pneumoniae pneumonia: nursing home residence (odds ratio [OD] 3.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-10.06), low c-reactive protein (CRP) levels (OD 5.99, 95% CI 1.82-19.67), nonproductive cough (OD 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.73), and a normal urinalysis (OD 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.83).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 630 patients from nearly all regions of Croatia with a clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonia based on epidemiologic data, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and chest X-rays. Most of them were from Zagreb (n = 370), followed by those from Slavonia, Istria, northwest Croatia, and Dalmatia. In all of them paired sera were collected at an interval of two weeks or more and tested for complement-fixing (CF) antibodies against the most common causative agents of the atypical pneumonia syndrome using CF test (micromethod). RESULTS: An etiologic diagnosis was established in 25% (158/630) patients (81 male and 77 female). Respiratory viruses were the most frequently demonstrated pathogens in 2002, accounting for 72% of cases (adenoviruses 47%, parainfluenza viruses 14%, influenza viruses 9% and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 2%). These were followed by Chlamydophila (C.) psittaci; (19%), Mycoplasma (M.) pneumoniae; (6%) and Coxiella (C.) burnetii (3%). There were 3 cases of double infection: a combination of adenovirus and M. pneumoniae, of RSV and parainfluenza virus, and of RSV and M. pneumoniae in one patient each. Adenoviral, mycoplasmal and psittacosal pneumonia occurred throughout the year; influenza and most of RSV pneumonias occurred in winter months. Parainfluenza viruses caused pneumonias throughout the year but were more common in winter months. CF test does not distinguish type-specific antibodies to parainfluenza viruses. In March, a small epidemic of psittacosis (11 patients) was registered in the Split area while was responsible for the high incidence of psittacosal pneumonia in 2002. While M. pneumoniae-caused pneumonia occurred mainly in children and adolescents, viral pneumonias were distributed across all age groups. Psittacosal pneumonia occurred in only one child but was more common in adolescents and especially adults. Q-fever pneumonia occurred only in adults."

Notification to the Epidemiological Monitoring System and Autonomic Agriculture authorities, taking the pertinent measures (inspection, sampling, disinfecting and precautionary quarantine of birds), closing the establishment. Case definition and epidemiological survey. Frequency analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen (17) individuals (one of whom died) came into contact with suspicious animals (53% males/47% females), nine of whom (mean age: 30) showed symptoms (100% fever, flu-like symptoms 44.4%). A serology was performed for C. psitacci on 11 of the 17 subjects exposed (68.75%), two of whom (18.18%) tested positive. The presence of C. psittaci DNA was detected in the pulmonary tissue study conducted on the deceased individual. A total of 33% (3/9) of those showing symptoms were confirmed by diagnosis.

","SPECIES:Chlamydia psittaciID:16669925TITLE:The atypical pneumonias: clinical diagnosis and importance.ABSTRACT:The most common atypical pneumonias are caused by three zoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and three nonzoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella. These atypical agents, unlike the typical pathogens, often cause extrapulmonary manifestations. Atypical CAPs are systemic infectious diseases with a pulmonary component and may be differentiated clinically from typical CAPs by the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement which is characteristic for each atypical CAP. Zoonotic pneumonias may be eliminated from diagnostic consideration with a negative contact history. The commonest clinical problem is to differentiate legionnaire's disease from typical CAP as well as from C. pneumoniae or M. pneumonia infection. Legionella is the most important atypical pathogen in terms of severity. It may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP and other atypical pathogens by the use of a weighted point system of syndromic diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary features. Because legionnaire's disease often presents as severe CAP, a presumptive diagnosis of Legionella should prompt specific testing and empirical anti-Legionella therapy such as the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's weighted point score system. Most atypical pathogens are difficult or dangerous to isolate and a definitive laboratory diagnosis is usually based on indirect, i.e., direct flourescent antibody (DFA), indirect flourescent antibody (IFA). Atypical CAP is virtually always monomicrobial; increased IFA IgG tests indicate past exposure and not concurrent infection. Anti-Legionella antibiotics include macrolides, doxycycline, rifampin, quinolones, and telithromycin. The drugs with the highest level of anti-Legionella activity are quinolones and telithromycin. Therapy is usually continued for 2 weeks if potent anti-Legionella drugs are used. In adults, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may exacerbate or cause asthma. The importance of the atypical pneumonias is not related to their frequency (approximately 15% of CAPs), but to difficulties in their diagnosis, and their nonresponsiveness to beta-lactam therapy. Because of the potential role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), and the role of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in causing or exacerbating asthma, atypical CAPs also have public health importance."

On a diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, minocycline was given and her clinical symptoms and abnormal laboratory data were improved. The second case was her husband, a 58-year-old man who presented with fever 4 days after his wife's admission. His chest radiograph revealed increased opacity in the left lower lung field. The administration of azithromycin for 3 days attenuated his clinical symptoms and his abnormal laboratory data improved. The serum titer of complement fixation (CF) test and ELISA test against Chlamydophila psittaci were elevated in both cases on analysis of paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum speciments. The antigen of Chlamydophila was revealed from these parrots, which had been raised in their family. Therefore, we concluded that the psittacosis had originated from the parrots."

The three most common zoonotic atypical pathogens are Chlamydophila psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Atypical CAPs are suggested by a distinctive pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. Zoonotic CAP may be differentiated from nonzoonotic CAP (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionnaire's disease) by a recent zoonotic vector contact history. Zoonotic atypical CAP occurs sporadically, but not randomly, and require close association with the appropriate zoonotic vector to transmit the infection. CAP accompanied by the extrapulmonary finding of splenomegaly in a normal host limits differential diagnostic possibilities to Q fever and psittacosis. Splenomegaly does not occur with other typical or atypical CAP. Another common extrapulmonary finding occurs with some atypical pneumonias, that is, Q fever, psittacosis, and Legionnaire's disease is early mild/transient elevations of serum transaminases indicative of (hepatic) extrapulmonary organ involvement. The case presented is a middle-aged man with longstanding Crohn's disease who was further immunosuppressed by chronic prednisone therapy. The patient presented with CAP and extrapulmonary findings, that is, splenomegaly and increased serum transaminases. He denied recent contact with birds or animals. Because Crohn's disease and Q fever CAP may be accompanied by splenomegaly, the cause of his splenomegaly was a diagnostic dilemma. The patient was treated with levofloxacin. Serologic tests for atypical pathogens (Q fever, psittacosis, Legionnaire's disease, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) were ordered. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology for Q fever was positive with elevated acute immunoglobulin-M (phase II) titers. Re-questioning of the patient revealed a recent exposure to a neighbor's parturient cat, providing the necessary zoonotic vector contact history for Q fever. The patient responded to levofloxacin, which resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms, right lower lobe pneumonia, and splenomegaly. Because a prior abdominal computed tomography scan indicated no splenomegaly and his splenomegaly resolved with antimicrobial therapy, the splenomegaly was related to Q fever CAP."

Staff members not trained about zoonosis or psittacosis used little protective attire such as masks and gloves when caring for their discharges. Two of 67 staff members contracted psittacosis pneumonia. Additional two suffered from pneumonia and 19 reported symptoms such as fever and cough, although none were diagnosed with psittacosis. The roughly 970 birds were kept without quarantine and identified by leg bands. Doxycycline administrated in drinking water and food failed to eradicate chlamydia, so all birds were captured, identified by leg band, and tested for chlamydia by PCR. Six were found to carry large amounts of chlamydia. Major outer membrane protein (MOMP) DNA sequence of chlamydia in a patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was identical to that derived from a channel-billed toucan kept in a closed aviary, and staff members may have been infected by inhaling excrement while working in the aviary.

Apart from well-established agents of pneumonia such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci and Coxiella burnetii, some new emerging pathogens have recently been recognized, mainly Parachlamydia acanthamoebae and Simkania negevensis, two Chlamydia-related bacteria. Most of them are causes of benign and self-limited infections. However, they may cause severe pneumonia in some cases (i.e., Legionnaires' disease) and they may cause outbreaks representing a public health problem deserving prompt recognition and appropriate therapy. Although extrapulmonary manifestations are often present, no clinical features allow them to be distinguished from classical bacterial agents of pneumonia such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, specific molecular diagnostic tools are very helpful for early recognition of the offending bacteria, whereas serology often only allows retrospective or late diagnosis. Macrolides remain the best empirical treatment of intracellular respiratory pathogens, although some observational studies suggest that quinolones may be superior for the treatment of legionellosis."

We sought to determine the basis of the 1000-fold difference in lethal dose of 2 C. psittaci 6BC strains in mice. METHODS: Genomes of the strains were sequenced. Mice were infected intraperitoneally and the growth kinetics, immune responses, and pathology were compared. RESULTS: The 2 strains differed by the presence of a 7.5-kb plasmid in the attenuated strain and 7 nonsynonomous single-nucleotide polymorphisms between the chromosomes, including a serine/threonine protein kinase gene pkn5. The plasmid was cured from the attenuated strain, but it remained nonlethal. Strains did not differ in growth kinetics in vitro or in vivo. Infection with the attenuated strain led to influx of activated macrophages with relatively minor organ damage. In contrast, the virulent strain caused an influx of nonactivated macrophages, neutrophils, and significant end organ damage. Mice infected with the virulent strain survived challenge when coinfected with either the plasmid-positive or plasmid-negative attenuated strain, indicating that an active process elicited by the attenuated strain reduces inflammation and disease. CONCLUSIONS: C. psittaci modulates virulence by alteration of host immunity, which is conferred by small differences in the chromosome."

The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological differences between NHCAP patients in a teaching university hospital and a community hospital. In addition, to clarify the strategy for treatment of NHCAP, we investigated the role of atypical pathogens. METHODS: We analyzed 250 NHCAP and 421 CAP cases in a university hospital and 349 NHCAP and 374 CAP cases in a community hospital. RESULTS: Patient age and the incidences of poor general condition were significantly higher in the community hospital compared with those in the university hospital. The distribution and frequency of pathogens, especially multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, were significantly different between the two hospitals. Central nervous system disorders, dementia and poor performance status, which was possibility related to aspiration pneumonia, were significantly more frequent in patients with NHCAP compared with those with CAP in both hospitals. Atypical pathogens were detected in a few cases in patients with NHCAP. CONCLUSION: There were many differences in the clinical characteristics between NHCAP patients in a university hospital and a community hospital even for hospitals located in the same area. Aspiration pneumonia was thought to be the main characteristic of NHCAP in both hospitals. Thus, all NHCAP patients did not need the same empiric therapy with a multidrug regimen directed against MDR pathogens. In addition, physicians rarely need to consider atypical pathogens in NHCAP treatment."

We performed a retrospective study of 13 consecutive patients with CAP due to C. psittaci and 51 patients with legionellosis admitted in one intensive care unit (ICU) (1993-2011). As compared to patients with legionellosis, patients with psittacosis were younger (median age 48 [38-59] vs. 60 [50-71] years, p = 0.007), less frequently smokers (38 vs. 79 %, p &lt; 0.001), with less chronic disease (15 vs. 57 %, p = 0.02), and longer duration of symptoms before admission (median 6 [5-13] vs. 5 [3-7] days, p = 0.038). They presented with lower Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (median 28 [19-38] vs. 39 [28-46], p = 0.04) and less extensive infiltrates on chest X-rays (median 2 [1-3] vs. 3 [3-4] lobes, p = 0.007). Bird exposure was mentioned in 100 % of psittacosis cases, as compared to 5.9 % of legionellosis cases (p &lt; 0.0001). Extrapulmonary manifestations, biological features, and mortality (15.4 vs. 21.6 %, p = 0.62) were similar in both groups. In conclusion, severe psittacosis shares many features with severe legionellosis, including extrapulmonary manifestations, biological features, and outcome. Psittacosis is an important differential diagnosis for legionellosis, especially in cases of bird exposure, younger age, and more limited disease progression over the initial few days."

Chlamydophila psittaci DNA was detected in samples from 23 patients. Four of 18 specimens were culture positive. This is the first description of endemic psittacosis, and is characterized in this location by community-acquired psittacosis resulting from inadvertent exposure to birds. The disease is likely to be under-diagnosed, and may often be mistaken for gastroenteritis or meningitis given the frequency of non-respiratory symptoms, particularly without a history of contact with birds.

Most likely the reported incidence, ranging from of 0% to 2.1%, is an underestimation of the real incidence, since detection of psittacosis is frequently not incorporated in the routine microbiological diagnostics in CAP or serological methods are used. METHODS: C. psittaci real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was routinely performed on the sputum of 147 patients hospitalised with CAP, who participated in a clinical trial conducted in two Dutch hospitals. In 119/147 patients the paired complement fixation test (CFT) was also performed for the presence of Chlamydia antibodies. Positive CFTs were investigated by micro- Immunofluorescence for psittacosis specificity. Case criteria for psittacosis were a positive PCR or a fourfold rise of antibody titre in CFT confirmed by micro- Immunofluorescence. Furthermore, we searched for parameters that could discriminate psittacosis from CAPs with other aetiology. RESULTS: 7/147 (4.8%) patients were diagnosed with psittacosis: six with PCR and one patient with a negative PCR, but with CFT confirmed by micro- Immunofluorescence. Psittacosis patients had had a higher temperature (median 39.6 vs. 38.2  C;) but lower white blood cell count (median 7.4 vs. 13.7 x 109/l) on admission compared with other CAP patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, C. psittaci as CAP-causing pathogen was much higher than previously reported. To detect psittacosis, PCR was performed on all CAP patients for whom a sputum sample was available. For clinical use, PCR is a fast method and sputum availability allows genotyping; additional serology can optimise epidemiological investigations."

Intracellular bacteria are common causes of CAP. However, there is considerable variation in the reported incidence between countries and change over time. The intracellular pathogens that are well established as causes of pneumonia are Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Coxiella burnetii. Since it is known that antibiotic treatment for severe CAP is empiric and includes coverage of typical and atypical pathogens, microbiological diagnosis bears an important relationship to prognosis of pneumonia. Factors such as adequacy of initial antibiotic or early de-escalation of therapy are important variables associated with outcomes, especially in severe cases. Intracellular pathogens sometimes appear to cause more severe disease with respiratory failure and multisystem dysfunction associated with fatal outcomes. The clinical relevance of intracellular pathogens in severe CAP has not been specifically investigated. We review the prevalence, general characteristics, and outcomes of severe CAP cases caused by intracellular pathogens. "

","SPECIES:Chlamydia psittaciID:29719801TITLE:An unusual presentation of a case of human psittacosis.ABSTRACT:Background: Chlamydia psittaci is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular organism. Birds are the main reservoir, but also non-avian domestic animals and humans can be infected. In humans it mostly causes respiratory infections due to occupational exposure with varying severity. Sensitive and specific diagnostic tests are needed to define psittacosis in humans as these tests also allow rapid tracing of the animal source. However, diagnosis in humans is often based on time-consuming culture techniques and antibody detection assays as in many countries, the existing molecular diagnostic tests for psittacosis are not reimbursed by the public health insurance. Case presentation: An 82-year old female was referred to the hospital with a non-productive cough since four weeks and since one week fever up to 39  C, myalgia, generalized skin rash, acral edema and generalized weakness under treatment with moxifloxacin. Blood analysis showed signs of inflammation with mild eosinophilia. Chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground glass opacities with consolidation in both lungs. Pulmonary function testing only showed a mild decrease in diffusion capacity. Viral and bacterial serology were negative. As the patient kept a pet parakeet for over ten years, a nested PCR for C. psittaci was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab of the patient and on feces of the parakeet. Both returned positive for the same genotype. Genotyping was performed by a genotype-specific real-time PCR. The patient fully recovered after a ten-day course of azithromycin. Conclusion: Due to non-specific signs during psittacosis, early detection of the infection and differentiation from hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be challenging. Culture and antibody titers for C. psittaci have a lower sensitivity than PCR-testing due to several factors. We present a case of human psittacosis (presenting as pneumonia) with diagnosis based on clinical findings confirmed by means of nested PCR. This case suggests the added value of PCR in suspect cases despite negative serology. Our current paper underlines the need for a broader implementation of PCR for early diagnosis of human psittacosis and thus early initiation of correct antibiotic treatment with reduction of morbidity and mortality."

We investigated to establish whether an outbreak occurred and to identify and control the source of infection. Methods: We undertook case finding for self-reported pneumonia cases at local businesses (July-August 2015). Clinical samples from a hospitalised case were tested for common respiratory pathogens, but returned negative results. Further testing confirmed Chlamydia psittaci infection in this case (serology and PCR).  We subsequently undertook C. psittaci testing for all cases, redefining them as confirmed (C. psittaci PCR or high antibody titre via serology) or probable (inconclusive C. psittaci serology). Twenty-eight day exposure histories informed descriptive epidemiological analysis. We conducted an environmental investigation at the office to identify potential sources of exposure. Results: We identified six office workers with pneumonia; four met case definitions (three confirmed, one probable) with symptom onset between 29th July and 4th August 2015. Workplace was the only epidemiological link and only one case reported limited, indirect bird contact. Environmental investigations identified pigeons roosting near the office which were being fed by workers (none cases). Discussion: This was a probable outbreak of psittacosis with no direct bird-to-human contact reported. Cases recovered after receiving appropriate antibiotics. Feeding of pigeons was stopped. A deep clean of office ventilation systems was conducted and workers were advised to avoid bird contact.  We hypothesised that indirect environmental exposure to infected pigeons was to the source of this outbreak. This work provides evidence that health professionals should consider psittacosis in the differential diagnosis of cases of severe or atypical respiratory illness even without overt bird contact."

Traditionally, juvenile fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) are caught at sea in late August. The fulmars may be infected or colonized with the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci which may infect the hunter by the respiratory route and mostly presents as an atypical pneumonia, also called psittacosis or ornithosis or parrot fever. In the Faroe Islands it is called 'natasjuka' meaning 'fulmar disease'. Historically, it has also been called 'September Pneumonia' in the Faroe Islands. METHODS: A case series with patients infected with Chlamydophila psittaci. RESULTS: All four cases presented in this article occurred around the month of September. Improved hygiene measures during the last 50 years in handling the fulmar birds have led to a decline of verified psittacosis in the Faroe Islands. After the last two hunting seasons (2016-2017), four cases of psittacosis were diagnosed and treated in the Faroe Islands. Only nine cases of verified psittacosis have been reported to the Chief Medical Officer of the Faroe Islands during the last 27 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between catching and handling Fulmarus glacialis and human psittacosis disease in the Faroe Islands. Clinicians treating patients with contact with fulmars should be aware of this zoonotic disease."

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 190 swabs were collected from psittacine birds (n = 120) and bird handlers (n = 70) and were tested by polymerase chain reaction to detect the C. psittaci ompA gene. Chlamydia psittaci DNA was detected in 63 (52 5%) of 120 samples collected from psittacine birds. The occurrence of C. psittaci infections was high in Cockatiel birds (60%), followed by Fischer's lovebird (51%) and Rosy-faced lovebird (47 5%). Bird age, location (pet markets and households), housing (caged and aviary), and sampling season were considered significant risk factors for C. psittaci infections in psittacine birds. Of the 70 sputum swabs collected from bird handlers, only 4 (6%) were positive for C. psittaci. Positive cases were closely associated with older persons (&gt;=30 years) who had respiratory signs and handled birds in pet markets. Further, wearing protective gloves and washing hands when handling psittacine birds decreased the frequency of C. psittaci infections in bird handlers. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. psittaci infections in psittacine birds in Egypt is high, which has a potential threat to human health in this area. Thus, dissemination of effective prevention and control measures is essential to prevent the spread of C. psittaci among psittacine birds, as well as among humans in contact with birds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results from this study highlighted the risk factors associated with C. psittaci infections in psittacine birds and bird handlers in Egypt and will aid in developing prevention and control measures to reduce the risk of C. psittaci infection."

We report three cases of severe pneumonia where C. psittaci was unexpectedly detected during routine validation of a new C. psittaci PCR assay. Psittacosis is a notifiable disease in Sweden and national statistics show that 96% of Swedish psittacosis cases were identified in five of the 24 microbiological laboratories available in the country.

Infection is associated with a range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic infection to severe atypical pneumonia and systemic disease. This paper reviews new knowledge on psittacosis, its legal and regulatory aspects and presents epidemiological data on psittacosis in Belgium. In Belgium, the number of reported positive laboratory results increased slowly since 2010, and in 2017, the number almost doubled compared to the two previous years. The number of psittacosis cases in Belgium, as in other countries, is probably highly underestimated, because of underdiagnoses and underreporting. Over the 3-year period, the mandatory notification system registered 24% only of all reported positive laboratory result. Therefore, increased awareness among general and occupational physicians, clinicians and the public is needed. Policies aimed at reducing psittacosis disease burden are justified, nevertheless national health authorities should provide more legal and financial support to implement more adequate C. psittaci diagnostic tools."

Humans most often become infected by inhaling the organism when urine, respiratory secretions, or dried feces of infected birds are dispersed in the air as very fine droplets or dust particles. C. psittaci infection of humans can cause influenza-like symptoms, such as fever of abrupt onset, pronounced headache, and dry cough, and can lead to severe pneumonia and non-respiratory health problems. Infection can also be asymptomatic. There is no vaccine for this infection. The disease is treatable with a tetracycline antibiotic, usually doxycycline, or a second-line therapy such as erythromycin or azithromycin. With appropriate treatment, the infection is rarely fatal. This report describes a case of severe, community-acquired pneumonia possibly due to C. psittaci in a resident of Colorado and examines significant clinical and epidemiological characteristics of psittacosis that affect confirming the diagnosis and managing the risks of exposure to psittacine (parrot-type) birds."

Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with development of neonatal respiratory disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. STUDY DESIGN: Multicentre retrospective case series. METHODS: The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. RESULTS: Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 hours of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of non-surviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using PCR testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). MAIN LIMITATIONS: Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and personal protective equipment should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection. This article is protected by copyright.

Implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) gives a promising new tool for diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of severe psittacosis pneumonia is described to provide physicians with a better understanding and to highlight the rarity and severity of severe psittacosis pneumonia. METHODS: Nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia were diagnosed using mNGS. Retrospective analysis of the data on disease progression, new diagnosis tool, treatments, and outcomes, and the findings were summarised. RESULTS: Frequent symptoms included chills and remittent fever (100%), cough and hypodynamia (100%), and headache and myalgia (77.8%). All patients were severe psittacosis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, accompanied by sepsis in 6/9 patients. mNGS takes 48-72 h to provide the results, and help to identify diagnosis of psittacosis. Laboratory data showed normal or slightly increased leucocytes, neutrophils, and procalcitonin but high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography revealed air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which began in the upper lobe of one lung, and spread to both lungs, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. One patient died because of secondary infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the other eight patients experienced complete recoveries.

The detection of C. psittaci DNA in the lung and equine foetal membranes of the aborted or weak foals and the absence of any other factors that are commonly associated with abortion or neonatal death suggest that this pathogen may be the cause of the reproductive loss. The detection of C. psittaci in these cases is consistent with the recent detection of C. psittaci in association with equine abortion in New South Wales.

METHODS: A prospective serological study was carried out on consecutive adult pneumonia patients from July 1987 to July 1988. Acute and convalescent sera were tested in batches for antibodies against Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, C. pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii (phase-2 antigen) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (IgG and IgM). Records and chest radiographs were examined retrospectively. RESULTS: Acute and convalescent sera were available from 113 patients. The records of 4 patients could not be traced and 17 patients did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Thirty-two of these 92 patients (35.9%) were found to be infected with 'atypical' bacteria.

This is the first demonstration of an aetiological role of C. pneumoniae in this country. We confirmed the finding of other studies that there are no clinical, radiographic or laboratory features characteristic of 'atypical' bacterial infection in hospitalised patients.

Outcome measures included quantitative evaluation of pneumonia-specific symptoms, and responses to the Short Form 36 Health Survey at presentation and at 30 days after presentation. Information was also collected on each patient's health prior to pneumonia, as well as the time until each patient's self-reported return to work and to usual activities. The etiology of pneumonia was determined by testing acute and convalescent serum samples for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, respiratory syncytia virus, influenza viruses A and B, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 149 patients, 54 (36%) of whom were men, with a mean age (+/- SD) of 41 +/- 15 years. An etiological diagnosis was made in 74 (49.7%) patients using serological methods. Etiological agents included M pneumoniae 34 (22.8%); C pneumoniae 16 (10.7%); M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae 5 (3.4%); C burnetii 4 (2.7%); influenza A virus 4 (2.7%); and other agents 6% (7.4%). Three patients (2%) had a conventional bacterial etiology, and 72 patients (48.3%) had pneumonia of undetermined etiology. Patients with pneumonia of known (atypical) and undetermined etiology were similar in terms of age, gender, race, education, employment, and comorbidity. Despite a higher proportion of patients with pneumonia of known etiology reporting sweats, chills, and headache at presentation, the two groups were similar for symptom severity and bother. The patients with pneumonia of undetermined etiology were more likely to have multilobar pneumonia (P &lt; 0.02). Both patients with atypical pneumonia and those with pneumonia of undetermined etiology suffered severe deterioration of physical functioning with a marked but incomplete recovery at 30 days. Those with atypical pneumonia had higher physical functioning and general mental health scores at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half the cases of ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia are due to ""atypical"" agents. It is not possible to reliably distinguish patients with atypical pneumonia from those with pneumonia of undetermined etiology by clinical features at baseline. The outcomes in terms of resolution of symptoms, functional status, return to work, and return to usual activities are essentially similar in the two groups."

This one-year prospective, protocol study of immunocompetent CAP patients diagnosed in the emergency room of our hospital enrolled patients not considered to require hospital admission according to the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Respiratory Disease (SEPAR). Medical histories, chest X-rays and blood analysis were obtained for all patients. Blood cultures were analyzed for antibodies against Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci and influenza virus types A and B. The patients received erythromycin for 14 days and were regularly checked by the pulmonologist in the outpatient clinic until signs and symptoms had disappeared. One hundred six patients were enrolled. Mean age was 36 +/- 13 years. Only 3 patients had to be admitted to hospital, after which outcome was good. The main symptoms were fever (106, 100%) and cough (83, 78%). In 46 (43.4%) chest sounds were normal. Microbiologic diagnoses were achieved for 28 (26.4%) and Coxiella burnetii was the agent most often found (19, 17.9%). Outcome was good in all cases, with faster disappearance of symptoms than of radiological signs. The SEPAR criteria for admitting patients with CAP are appropriate. The clinical symptoms of such patients are non specific, a noteworthy finding being that many patients had normal chest sounds. Coxiella burnetii was the most common causative agent.

Parrots and other psittacine birds still are regarded as the major reservoir of the infectious agent and most recognized cases are associated with owning pet birds or working in a pet store. It was once thought that birds imported from abroad, often illegally, were a principal source, but many domestic breeder flocks of pet birds now have become infected. There is little that is distinctive in the clinical presentation of psittacosis. Therefore, a careful history of bird contact is often the first clue to the diagnosis. The diagnosis frequently is first considered in evaluating a patient whose pneumonia has not responded to therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic. The diagnosis usually is established serologically. Tetracycline is the preferred therapy and is administered for three weeks to prevent relapses."

The most important investigations are blood cultures and sputum cultures to detect bacteria like pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus as well as antibody tests for Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia. According to anamnesis and clinic presentation tests such as for Legionella or viruses have to be added. Sometimes also rare pathogens have to be considered such as Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira, Hantaviruses, cryptococci or Chlamydia psittaci. The standard procedure for diagnosis of tuberculosis is the microscopical examination and the standardized culture in liquid and on solid media.

Initial serological testing suggested Chlamydia psittaci as the cause. We did a case-control study to find risk factors for psittacosis. METHODS: We searched for cases of pneumonia or severe flu-like illness through family physicians and the regional hospital. We selected three controls per case from the region's electoral roll. We collected blood for serological tests and administered questionnaires to all cases and controls. FINDINGS: We found 16 cases of psittacosis and one died. Most cases were clustered within a small geographical area, with a median age of 58 years (range 23-76), 15 (94%) of whom were male. Keeping, handling, or feeding domestic or wild birds was not associated with illness. Cases spent a median of 17.5 h per week in their garden, compared with a median of 5.2 h for controls (p=0.04) and were more likely to have mowed lawns during the 3 weeks before onset of illness than controls (odds ratio 4.81 [95% CI 1.08-33.37]). INTERPRETATION: We showed that psittacosis outbreaks are not limited to direct contact with birds and pose new challenges for disease control.

METHODS: A pneumonia outbreak occurred in a healthy middle-aged population working in a poultry slaughterhouse. Systematic serology (2 samples at 5 weeks intervals) provided the diagnosis of Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia in 6 patients. Patient files were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The clinical presentations in this series of pneumonia were particularly homogeneous with a pneumococcal profile in all 6 cases: sudden onset, temperature above 39 degrees C, lobar alveolar involvement, hypoxemia, hyperleukocytosis and liver dysfunction. One case of hallucinatory delirium was observed. The patients were given spiramycin (9 million units per day for 3 weeks) and all recovered rapidly with no complications. CONCLUSION: The unusual virulence of the Chlamydia psittaci and very important inoculum were probably involved in this outbreak because of the severity of the pulmonary features and the short exposure of some patients to the bacteria. These cases suggest that the prevention of ornithosis in poultry slaughterhouses should be reinforced."

Some researchers have suggested that KL-6 is produced and secreted by type II pneumocytes. The present study evaluated serum KL-6 levels in patients with summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis (summer-type HP) (n = 6, 7 episodes), Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (n = 16), Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia (n = 3), Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia (n = 9), and bacterial pneumonia (n = 12). In addition, transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) specimens were examined pathologically in order to identify the site of production and secretion of KL-6. In patients with summer-type HP, the serum KL-6 levels exceeded 500 U/ml (2.996 +/- 2.016 U/ml), but was below 500 U/ml (302 +/- 126 U/ml, p &lt; 0.001) in the patients with other infectious pneumonias, with the exception of two. One of these two patients with a high serum KL-6 level had adult respiratory distress syndrome due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The other had organizing pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae. TBLB specimens showed proliferative type II pneumocytes in all summer-type HP cases. We believe that the high serum KL-6 levels were produced by type II pneumocytes, and may provide a useful indicating serum marker for HP. Although serum LDH, serum CRP and PaO2 are known as monitoring markers in summer-type HP, our findings demonstrated no manifest correlations among these markers. However, serum KL-6 levels showed a strong positive correlation with serum LDH levels and an inverse correlation with serum CRP levels. These results suggest that serum KL-6 may be a better marker of the degree of disease activity than serum LDH, CRP, or PaO2 in summer-type HP."

METHODS: Between March, 1991, and April, 1993, children aged &lt;3 months were recruited at the outpatient department of Goroka Base Hospital, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Children with pre-defined inclusion criteria were enrolled, a history was taken and clinical examination was performed. Blood and urine were collected from children with signs suggestive of severe disease together with eye, umbilical and pernasal swabs as appropriate. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children with and without signs of severe disease for identification of viruses and Chlamydia trachomatis by direct fluorescent antibody staining. RESULTS: 3280 infants were triaged and 2168 enrolled, among whom 968 had signs suggestive of severe disease. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus were the most important bacterial pathogens isolated from children &lt; 1 month old with severe infections, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were most important in older children. Of 292 eye swabs 19 (7%) grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Of 116 umbilical swabs 51 (44%) grew S. pyogenes and 45 (39%) grew Staphylococcus aureus. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most important viral cause of acute lower respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are important causes of severe infection in young children in the PNG highlands.

Of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. RESULTS: There were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. The study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas Salmonella group B was found in 5 of 41 isolates. Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. A study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of Salmonella infections. Among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants."

Children with predefined inclusion criteria were enrolled. C. trachomatis was identified by direct fluorescent antibody staining in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected from children with and without signs of severe disease and eye swabs from children with and without conjunctivitis. Two to three radiologists read chest radiographs without knowledge of clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Of 3280 outpatients seen 2168 enrolled, 955 NPAs were tested for C. trachomatis and 549 chest radiographs were read. Of 210 eye swabs from children with conjunctivitis 57% were positive for C. trachomatis compared with 8% from 167 children with no conjunctivitis. The prevalence of C. trachomatis in NPAs was 9% in asymptomatic children and 18 and 33% in children with nonsevere or severe pneumonia, respectively. C. trachomatis in NPAs was strongly associated with clinically severe pneumonia [odds ratio (OR), 2.91], reduced arterial oxygen saturation (OR 2.58) and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (OR 5.84) and was also associated with pneumococcal bacteremia (OR 3.48).

Such regimens are unable to cure patients of pneumonia caused by 'unusual organisms' mycoplasma, chlamydia, Pneumocystis carinii and Legionella pneumophilus). Thus, there is a need to anticipate their presence in appropriate cases and to plan the initial antimicrobial therapy accordingly. Studies in Europe as well as India have shown that such infections form a fairly substantial percentage of community acquired pneumonia in children. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are common in school age children while Chlamydia trachomatis occurs in early infancy. Pneumocystis carinii is an important pathogen in immunocompromised children. Routine laboratory tests and radiological features are not specific enough to give accurate diagnosis of these infections for which one has to depend on sophisticated culture techniques, immunological tests for the antigens or antibodies and polymerase chain reaction. Mycoplasma, chlamydia and legionella infections respond to macrolide antibiotics and for pneumocystis infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethaxozole or pentamidine is the drug of choice. Overall prognosis with appropriate treatment is good except for P. carinii infection in immunocompromised host which carries a high mortality and recurrence rate."

The true prevalence of atypical agents such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this population of patients is unknown as the currently used method for diagnosing these agents is measurement of antibody levels.

L. pneumophila was detected in 1% of the BAL fluids and M. pneumoniae was found as a coexisting pathogen in 2% of the samples. Chlamydia spp. could not be detected in any of the BAL fluids. By culture and staining methods 106 other microorganisms were detected with P. carinii and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the most frequently occurring.

The problem is known to be higher in resource poor third world countries. Organisms (such as chlamydia) not covered by routine laboratory tests and regular antibiotic regimes may frequently contribute towards the causation of late neonatal pneumonia. It is therefore useful to gather epidemiological evidence to guide in the routine diagnosis and treatment of such infections. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of chlamydia associated pneumonia among infants developing the disease between the 7th and 30th days of life (late neonatal pneumonia). DESIGN: Cross sectional survey. SETTING: Newborn Unit, Kenyatta National Hospital. SUBJECTS: Fifty two newborns clinically diagnosed as having late neonatal pneumonia. They were all subjected to chest X-rays to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal aspirates for chlamydia antigen detection tests were then performed on all patients. The study was undertaken during the months of September through to November 2000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of newborns with late neonatal pneumonia that have chlamydia trachomantis as the sole or contributory causative agent. RESULTS: Fifty two newborns of postnatal age between seven and 30 days were recruited. Their sex distribution was about 1:1. Thirty three (63.5%) of these infants were found with chlamydia in their upper airways. Thirty out of 47 available chest X-rays, representing 63.8% had evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Chlamydia associated pneumonia indicated by the presence of both interstitial pneumonia and colonization of the upper air ways was present in 24 out of 47 patients, 51% of the total cases of late neonatal pneumonia. When X-rays alone were compared with our gold standard for the diagnosis of chlamydia pneumonia (radiology and colonization), we computed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 73%, negative predictive value 100% and positive predictive value of 80%. Mode of delivery, birth weight and gestation had no association with nasopharyngeal colonization by chlamydia or actual diagnosis of chlamydia pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of chlamydia associated infection among newborns with late neonatal pneumonia at Kenyatta National Hospital is 51%, eight times more than that reported elsewhere. Chest X-rays appear to be a reliable diagnostic tool in this group. The use of antichlamydial drugs in addition to the regular antibiotics whenever a diagnosis of late neonatal pneumonia is made is justifiable."

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci and C. pecorum as causes of CAP. A prospective cohort observational study of CAP was conducted at 15 teaching centres in eight Canadian provinces between January 1996-October 1997. Acute (n=539) and convalescent (n=272) serum samples were obtained for determination of antibody titres to C. pneumoniae, C. psittaci, C. pecorum, C. trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila serogroups I-VI, Streptococcus pneumoniae and various respiratory viruses. Twelve of 539 (2.2%) patients had acute C. pneumoniae pneumonia and an additional 32 (5.9%) had possible acute infection. C. pneumoniae was the sole pathogen in 16 of 42 (38.1%) of these patients. The most common copathogens were S. pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus type A. C. pneumoniae pneumonia patients were older and more likely to show congestive heart failure compared to bacteraemic S. pneumoniae patients. The latter had a lower mean diastolic blood pressure, a higher white blood cell count and a lower arterial carbon dioxide tension. Two patients had antibody titres suggestive of recent infection with the feline strain of C. psittaci. Although numerically Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia, no distinctive clinical features associated with this pathogen were detected in the present study. Feline Chlamydia psittaci may cause a few cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Avian Chlamydia psittaci should be considered only if there is a compatible epidemiological history."

Until recently, a course of oral erythromycin prophylaxis was recommended for C trachomatis-exposed neonates. However, recognition of an association between erythromycin and pyloric stenosis prompted a change to a watchful waiting recommendation under which only infants who develop symptomatic C trachomatis infection are treated with oral erythromycin. OBJECTIVE: To compare erythromycin prophylaxis with watchful waiting for a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 neonates exposed to C trachomatis. METHODS: In a decision tree, potential outcomes were C trachomatis conjunctivitis, C trachomatis pneumonia (which could require inpatient or outpatient therapy), no clinical disease, and pyloric stenosis. Published data were reviewed to derive probability point estimates and ranges. Estimated charges served as outcome measures. RESULTS: Watchful waiting is less expensive than erythromycin prophylaxis ($15.1 million vs $28.3 million); prophylaxis prevents 5986 cases of C trachomatis pneumonia, including 1197 hospital admissions, but causes 3284 pyloric stenosis cases. (For every 30 infants given oral erythromycin prophylaxis, one additional case of pyloric stenosis would be expected to occur, and approximately 1.8 cases of C trachomatis pneumonia would be prevented.) In sensitivity analyses, if more than 3.4% of exposed neonates are hospitalized for C trachomatis pneumonia, prophylaxis becomes favored. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the watchful waiting recommendation for asymptomatic C trachomatis-exposed neonates. However, there are wide plausible ranges for pyloric stenosis risk after erythromycin administration and for the incidence of C trachomatis pneumonia severe enough to require hospitalization; under some combinations of these rates, prophylaxis could be favored."

Nucleic acid amplification methods offer indeed rapid, reliable and low cost assessment pathogen bacteria isolation, with relevant benefits for the patient's management. These molecular methods are nowadays essential in presence of bacteria of difficult cultivation or method inconsistent with temporal clinical needs, for they allow to rapidly detect even nucleic acid traces of the infectious agent, providing direct evidence of its presence in the biological samples and hence the relevant therapy. Nucleic acid methods are extensively applied in laboratory diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis bringing about the development of sensitive and reliable commercial kits. This review analyses the literature of the genic amplification methods in the search of C. p. in clinical samples highlighting methodological and diagnostic aspects. Although genic amplification methods have been implemented presently by the clinical research labs only, it is anticipated that through their standardisation they could be used by most clinical microbiology laboratories."

The patient was admitted to our hospital because of shock, disturbance of consciousness, accidental hypothermia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and he recovered after administration of intravenous erythromycin and high-dose methylpredonisolone therapy. Psittacosis was confirmed by detection of 16S rRNA gene of C. psittasi in sputum with multiplex-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Serological responses to C. psittasi, C. trachomatis, and C. pneumoniae were also evaluated, and serological cross-reactivity was observed between each species. We consider that the commercially available immunochromatography assay for Chlamydia species can be helpful for rapid diagnosis of Chlamydia infection of the respiratory tract. Hereafter, further examination will be necessary regarding pretreatment of specimens or detection sensitivity and specificity."

Mothers of affected infants were found to have inclusions in their cervical epithelial cells, fathers of such infants had inclusions in their urethral cells, and the epidemiology of sexually transmitted chlamydial infections was revealed. Fifty years later, chlamydial isolation procedures were developed, and studies again demonstrated Chlamydia trachomatis as an etiology of ICN and the female birth canal as the reservoir. In the late 1970s, a report by Beem and Saxon described respiratory tract colonization and a distinct pneumonia syndrome in infected infants. Genital chlamydial infection is recognized as the world's most common sexually transmitted disease, with estimates of greater than 4 million new infections occurring annually in the United States. Although most C. trachomatis infections in men and women are asymptomatic, infection can lead to severe reproductive complications in women. The high prevalence in women of child-bearing age results in exposure of an estimated 100,000 neonates in the United States annually. Many of these infants develop conjunctivitis, pneumonia, or both in the first few months of life. Clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and approaches to prevention of conjunctivitis and pneumonia in the newborn and young infant are reviewed here. Appropriate testing for chlamydial infection in a pediatric victim of sexual assault and the implications of identifying C. trachomatis in suspected cases of childhood sexual abuse also are reviewed."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic features, clinical manifestations, and outcome of C. trachomatis pneumonia patients seen during the past 10 years in one medical center. We reviewed the records on 30 patients with a diagnosis of C. trachomatis pneumonia. The diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical features and confirmed by culture, serologic testing, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical features including age, sex, symptoms at the time of admission, laboratory data, and treatment were analyzed. Of the 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), 29 (96%) were less than 4 months old (range 10 days to 5 months). All patients had productive cough followed by tachypnea. Three patients (10%) presented with apnea. Four (13%) had conjunctivitis. Fever was present in only 3 (10%), of whom 2 also had concurrent respiratory syncytial virus infection. Peripheral eosinophilia (eosinophils &gt; or = 400/mm3) was present in 14 (47%) patients. Hyperinflation was seen on chest x-ray in 15 patients. All infants were treated with erythromycin and responded well. The mean time to clinical improvement was 3.53 days after the start of treatment. The mean duration of hospitalization was 8.97 days (range, 3 to 17 days). No patients died. Pediatricians and general practitioners must have a high index of suspicion for chlamydial infection in afebrile infants presenting with tachypnea, peripheral eosinophilia, and hyperinflation on chest x- ray during the first four months of life."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the incidence of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia in the etiology of respiratory tract infections of children. The present study included 100 children, three months to 12 years of age, admitted to the outpatient department of pediatrics with such respiratory symptoms as fever, cough and respiratory distress. Following a detailed clinical history and physical examination, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, peripheral blood smear and chest X-ray were obtained from each patient. At admission, IgG and IgM for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia psittaci were determined serologically. Positive antibody titer was found for Chlamydia and Mycoplasma in 18 (18%) of the patients. It was found that 2% of the patients had acute C. pneumoniae infection. When the subjects who had infections in the past or had re-infection were also considered; 6% were infected with C. pneumoniae, 3% with C. trachomatis, 1% with C. psittaci and 8% with M. pneumoniae. The presence of eosinophilia (&gt; or = 4%) or the presence of siblings in the house were considered as factors favoring Chlamydial infections. High antibody titers for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were found more frequently after the age of two.

It has also been suggested that C pneumoniae infection may lead to lung remodeling in a subset of asthmatic patients. Seroreactivity against Chlamydia trachomatis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60), a highly conserved, immunoreactive chaperone protein, is associated with immunopathologic abnormalities, leading to blinding trachoma and tubal infertility. This suggests that the host response to infection may affect chronic inflammatory damage to the eye and the fallopian tubes. The pathogenesis of C trachomatis disease associations is thought to include molecular mimicry (autoimmunity), direct activation of the innate immune response via the CD14/toll-like receptor 4 complex, or both. OBJECTIVE: To study whether airflow limitation in asthma in C pneumoniae-exposed individuals is associated with a specific antibody response to the C pneumoniae hsp60 molecule and not with a genus-specific response to the hsp60 molecule. METHODS: In a case-control study, we evaluated 138 C pneumoniae-exposed primary care patients (86 adult asthmatic cases and 52 nonasthmatic controls) for seroreactivity against a C pneumoniae-specific hsp60 fragment and against the C trachomatis hsp60 molecule. We analyzed associations with asthma and irreversible lung remodeling as measured by means of postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of asthmatic patients were C pneumoniae hsp60 seropositive vs 8% of controls (P &lt; .01). Controlling for age, sex, and smoking, C pneumoniae hsp60 seropositivity was associated with lower postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second in asthmatic patients (P &lt; .05). No comparable associations were present for C trachomatis hsp60. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with evidence of previous exposure to C pneumoniae infection, a host antibody response against a C pneumoniae hsp60 fragment but not against C trachomatis hsp60 was associated with airflow limitation in adults with asthma."

METHODS: Respiratory secretion and blood specimens were collected in 1167 children with CAP within 4 hrs of admission. Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia trachomatis were detected by RT-PCR in respiratory secretion specimens. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-IgM) and Adenovirus (ADV-IgM) were tested using ELISA in blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 308 strains of bacteria were isolated from the respiratory tract secretions, with gram positive strains of 53.6% and gram negative strains of 46.4%. The top five bacteria strains detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.1%), Escherichia coli (11.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.8%), Klebsiella pneumonia (6.5%) and Moraxelle catarrhalis (5.8%) in turn. Beta-lactamase and ESBLs producing strains accounted for 30.1% in the top five bacteria strains. The non-bacteria pathogens were found in 281 specimens (24.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus accounted for the most prevalent pathogen (19.3%). The mixed infection of respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae was common (35.2%). The infection rate from most of pathogenic microorganisms among children under the age of one was higher than that in children over one year old. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major pathogens of CAP in children.

Most current information pertains to adults and little is known about the role of these organisms in lower respiratory tract infections among young children with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: This study detected these pathogens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of children between 1 month and 2 years of age admitted with acute bronchiolitis to hospitals in Khon Kaen, northeast Thailand. The M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae in the nasopharyngeal secretions were detected using multiplex and nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to investigate C trachomatis. These samples were also tested by multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR for respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, influenza B, and human metapneumovirus. RESULTS: Of the 170 samples taken from hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis, 12.9% were infected with atypical bacteria and 85.3% with respiratory viruses. RSV was the most common causative viral agents found in 64.7% of the samples. M pneumoniae was the most common atypical bacterial pathogen (14/170, 8.2%) and most of the patients infected with it were between 6 and less than 12 months of age (71 cases). Of the infected cases in this age group, 7 of 14 were infected with M pneumoniae and 4 of 4 with C pneumoniae. Both M pneumoniae (13/14) and C pneumoniae (4/4) had etiologies indicating viral coinfections. Four (2.4%) of all of the cases had C trachomatis infections and all of these were infected with RSV, including three patients less than 6 months of age. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in children with virus-induced acute bronchiolitis coinfection with M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, or C trachomatis can be expressed differently in each age group. These atypical bacteria may be the important infectious agents that induce severe illness of acute bronchiolitis."

In pregnant women it can cause premature delivery. In newborns the clinical manifestation are pneumonia and conjunctivitis. AIM: The aim of the study was to estimate the perinatal transmission of Chlamydia trachomatis and the prevalence of neonatal complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 82 mothers with delivery &lt; 34 weeks of gestation and 100 of their newborns. All patients were hospitalized at the Poznan University of Medical Sciences Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital between 2004 and 2009. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in AMPLICOR CT/NG test was used for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. RESULTS: Chlamydia trachomatis was identified in 8 pregnant women among 82 tested patients (10%) and in 6 neonates. Perinatal transmission was 75%. All infected infants developed respiratory disorders. Five of them needed respiratory support such as nCPAP or mechanical ventilation. Three newborns presented apneic spells. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic chlamydial infection is frequently detected in women with preterm delivery. There is high risk of perinatal transmission of the infection from the mother to the newborn, which leads to perinatal complications such as neonatal pneumonia which in preterm infants can develop just after the delivery and give rise to life-threatening respiratory disorders."

Most persons with this infection are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can result in serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis and orchitis in men. Men and women can experience chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis. Treatment of uncomplicated cases should include azithromycin or doxycycline. Screening is recommended in all women younger than 25 years, in all pregnant women, and in women who are at increased risk of infection. Screening is not currently recommended in men. In neonates and infants, the bacterium can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Adults may also experience conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia.

Patients with pneumonia accounted for 73.90% of the patients. More than one-third of the patients developed severe pneumonia, whereas no death was found. Features of severe adenovirus-associated lower respiratory tract infection included persistent high fever with serious infective symptoms, and hepatic dysfunction was one of the most common complications. Mixed infection of atypical pathogens was common (18.58%) in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus is a critical pathogen that can cause severe respiratory infections even in immunocompetent children. Coinfection of adenovirus with atypical pathogens is common. Antibiotic treatment with azithromycin or erythromycin is necessary in patients with mixed infection of atypical pathogens."

OBJECTIVE: To describe children with afebrile pneumonia syndrome. METHODS: Through a cross-sectional study, we reviewed the medical records of children diagnosed with afebrile pneumonia treated at Hospital Universitario del Valle, a reference center in southwestern Colombia, between June 2001 and December 2007. We obtained data on maternal age and origin, prenatal care, the childs birth, breastfeeding, vaccination status, symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and complications. RESULTS: We evaluated 101 children with this entity, noting a stationary presentation: June-August and November- December. A total of 73% of the children were under 4 months of age; the most common symptoms were: cyanotic and spasmodic cough (100%), respiratory distress (70%), and unquantified fever (68%). The most common findings: rales (crackles) (50%), wheezing and expiratory stridor (37%); 66% were classified as mild and of the remaining 33%, half of them required attention in the intensive care unit. In all, there was clinical diagnosis of afebrile pneumonia syndrome in infants, but no etiologic diagnosis was made and despite this, 94% of the children received macrolides. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that most of these patients acquired the disease by airway, possibly caused by viral infection and did not require the indiscriminate use of macrolides."

","SPECIES:Chlamydia trachomatisID:25445657TITLE:The clinical characteristics and genotype distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in infants less than six months of age hospitalized with pneumonia.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually-transmitted bacterial pathogen. As no routine screening is performed during pregnancy, neonates and infants are at high risk for C. trachomatis infection. The objective of this study was to investigate the morbidity, clinical characteristics and genotype distribution of C. trachomatis pneumonia in infants less than six months of age. METHODS: Clinical manifestations and laboratory results were recorded. Respiratory sputum specimens were tested using RT-PCR targeting C. trachomatis cryptic plasmid. Simultaneously, respiratory virus antigens were detected by direct immunofluorescence and bacterial pathogens were examined by culture in all sputum samples. Positive C. trachomatis samples were further genotyped using a multiplex PCR reverse line blot assay. The relationship between genotype and pneumonia severity was explored. RESULTS: Of 1408 infants, 101 (7.2%) were infected with C. trachomatis. Sixteen of 101 (15.8%) were assessed as severe pneumonia. These severe cases had a higher proportion of viral co-infection (37.5%) compared to mild pneumonia cases (9.4%, P&lt;0.05).Infants with tachypnea (OR 9.2) and wheezing (OR 3.5) were more likely to be classified as severe pneumonia (P&lt;0.05). Amongst 66 C. trachomatis specimens for which a genotyping result was available, seven genotypes were detected, and 39.4% of these specimens contained two or three genotypes. Overall, genotype E (48.5%) was the most frequent, followed by genotype F (42.4%), J (31.8%), D (12.1%), K (10.6%), G (4.5%) and H (3.0%). There were no significant correlations of particular genotypes with severity of disease, although there was a weak indication that more severe pneumonia might be associated with having certain mixed genotypes of C. trachomatis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. trachomatis in the population of young hospitalized infants with pneumonia in Shenzhen was very high. The relationship between genotype distribution and severity of pneumonia was not clear based on this study due to small sample size. Further in-depth investigation correlating genotype and disease severity based on a larger population is needed."

Detection of C. trachomatis DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes using polymer chain reaction (PCR) may be a better tool for the diagnosis of infection by this pathogen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 44 premature newborns, all weighing less than 2500g, were included in the study. A blood sample and nasopharyngeal lavages were obtained from each newborn. Leukocyte DNA was obtained by phenol-chloroform extraction technique. Detection of C. trachomatis was performed by amplifying the ompA gene using the PCR endpoint. Cell culture tests and the detection of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis by microimmunofluorescence assay were also performed. RESULTS: Twenty newborns were PCR-positive (45.5%), with this test being significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia (RR=2.28; 95%CI: 1.01 to 5.17; P=.035). The cell culture of nasopharyngeal lavage was positive in only 7 samples and no significant association was observed with any clinical or laboratory data. The titer of IgM antibodies against C. trachomatis associated with PCR-positive was 1:32 (RR=2.74; 95%CI: 1.21 to 6.23; P=.008), however this titer was not associated with the presence of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: DNA detection in peripheral blood leukocytes could be useful for diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection."

METHODS: We performed a prospective study in Mansoura University Hospitals, Egypt, for detecting H. pylori infection by estimating H. pylori IgG and IgM, in addition to detection of Chlamydiae infections by PCR in 90 pregnant women with PE and 90 normotensive pregnant women of the same age and body mass index who were studied as control. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in preeclamptic pregnant women was 54.4% with a statistically significant association to PE. The prevalence of C. pneumonia was 27.8% whereas that of C. trachomatis was 4.44%. The infected preeclamptic cases showed high levels of leucocytes besides elevated C-reactive protein concentrations. CONCLUSION: Helicobacter pylori was found to act as a cofactor in the development of PE. Occurrence of C. trachomatis was low in pregnant women in our community; however, it showed that it may act as a cofactor in PE, whereas C. pneumoniae was attributed to have no role in PE pathogenesis until supported by further studies."

Her medical history noted a recent uncomplicated pregnancy and birth of a healthy child. Our differential diagnosis included pyelonephritis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia causing pleural pain, a gastrointestinal cause, or a subphrenic abscess. A vaginal culture was taken as part of a second opinion by a gynaecologist. However, after a few days PCR on the vaginal sample was positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, indicating a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. This syndrome is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease caused by a bacterial infection, most frequently Gonococcal or Chlamydia species. The patient was treated with doxycycline and recovered quickly. As a result of ignoring a possible gynaecological cause in this patient, the time to diagnosis and treatment was delayed. Left untreated, this disease might result in infertility and in complications in the newborn. A broad differential diagnosis is therefore important. "

The age of the infant, the history of both mother and child, as well as the current maternal condition may provide important diagnostic information. A 4-week-old male infant was referred to the paediatrician with a persistent cough. He was admitted to hospital with dyspnoea and need for supplemental oxygen. Meanwhile, his mother was admitted with unexplained abdominal pain and elevated laboratory inflammation markers. Her history revealed an ectopic pregnancy. The infant's condition, for which the initial differential diagnosis was viral bronchiolitis or whooping cough, deteriorated. His medical history revealed a purulent conjunctivitis. Chlamydia trachomatis PCR turned out to be positive in both mother and child. C. trachomatis pneumonia is a common, yet often overlooked cause of cough in infants.

However, there is no conclusive evidence that a child with CAP should receive empirical treatment against such agents. Objectives: We assessed the possibility of association between clinical failure and acute infection by these bacteria among children with CAP treated with amoxicillin. Patients and methods: Patients aged 2-59 months with non-severe CAP received amoxicillin during prospective follow-up. Acute and convalescent blood samples were collected. Probable acute infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (specific IgM antibodies), by Chlamydia pneumoniae or Chlamydia trachomatis (specific IgM antibodies and/or IgG/IgA titre change) was investigated. Outcomes were assessed during follow-up at 2, 5 and 14-28 days. Treatment failure included development of danger signs, persistent fever, tachypnoea or death. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01200706. Results: Of 787 children, 86 (10.9%; 95% CI = 8.9%-13.3%) had acute M. pneumoniae infection. C. pneumoniae acute infection was found in 79 of 733 (10.8%; 95% CI = 8.7%-13.2%) and C. trachomatis was found in 3 of 28 (10.7%; 95% CI = 2.8%-26.5%) &lt;6 months old. Among patients with or without treatment failure at 2 days, acute M. pneumoniae infection (11.7% versus 10.7%; P  =   0.7), acute C. pneumoniae infection (8.5% versus 11.3%; P  =   0.3) and acute C. trachomatis infection (16.7% versus 9.1%; P  =   0.5) were found. No significant differences were found with regard to treatment failure at the 5 day evaluation. Overall, amoxicillin was substituted in 3.5% versus 2.7% among patients with or without acute infection by one of these bacteria ( P  =   0.6). Conclusions: The overall substitution rate of amoxicillin was very low. It is not necessary to give an empirical non-beta-lactam antibiotic as a first-line option to treat every child between 2 and 59 months old with non-severe CAP."

According to their age, they were divided into infant group (402 infants aged 28 days to 1 year), young children group (73 children aged 1 to 3 years), preschool children group (35 children aged 3 to 6 years), and school-aged children group (12 children aged &gt;=6 years). According to the onset season, all children were divided into spring group (March to May, 120 children), summer group (June to August, 93 children), autumn group (September to November, 105 children), and winter group (December to February, 204 children). Sputum specimens from the deep airway were collected from all patients. The phoenix-100 automatic bacterial identification system was used for bacterial identification and drug sensitivity test. The direct immunofluorescence assay was used to detect seven common respiratory viruses. The quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). RESULTS: Of all the 522 children with severe CAP, 419 (80.3%) were found to have pathogens, among whom 190 (45.3%) had mixed infection. A total of 681 strains of pathogens were identified, including 371 bacterial strains (54.5%), 259 viral strains (38.0%), 12 fungal strains (1.8%), 15 MP strains (2.2%), and 24 CT strains (3.5%). There were significant differences in the distribution of bacterial, viral, MP, and fungal infections between different age groups (P&lt;0.05). There were significant differences in the incidence rate of viral infection between different season groups (P&lt;0.05), with the highest incidence rate in winter. The drug-resistance rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin reached above 85%, and the drug-resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin were above 50%; they were all sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. The drug-resistance rates of Haemophilus influenzae to cefaclor and cefuroxime were above 60%, but it was sensitive to cefotaxime. The drug-resistance rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to ampicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone were above 60%, but they were sensitive to carbapenems and compound preparation of enzyme inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are the main pathogens in children with severe CAP and mixed infection is prevalent. The drug-resistance rates of these pathogenic bacteria are high."

Eighty-six patients with CAP in chemotherapy induction period of acute leukemia in Dezhou Hospital from March 2014 to February 2017 were selected and divided into observation group (SCAP group, n=45) and control group (non-SCAP group, n=41) according to the acute physiology and chronic health evolution II (APACHE II) score. The blood, sputum, nasopharyngeal secretion and pleural effusion samples were collected from patients in both groups, and the samples were detected for pathogens, followed by the analysis of relevant factors. The dynamic changes in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer (D-D) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients were observed before and after the corresponding treatment strategies were taken. The total distribution ratio of pathogens from high to low in the two groups was as follows: bacterium, virus, fungus, mycoplasma and chlamydia trachomatis; there was no significant difference between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the repeated infection (OR=3.315, P=0.005), multi-resistant bacterial infection (OR=1.915, P=0.008) and D-D (OR=1.936, P=0.009) were independent risk factors for SCAP (P&lt;0.05). After different coping strategies were taken, the SOFA score, PCT, D-D and CRP levels in the two groups were significantly decreased, and they were obviously higher in observation group than those in control group (P&lt;0.05). Repeated infection, D-D level and multi-resistant bacterial infection are the risk factors affecting the SCAP in chemotherapy induction period of acute leukemia.

Three hundred forty-four children hospitalized with Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia were enrolled. They were divided into the vaginal delivery group and the cesarean delivery group. We compared and analyzed their age of onset, peripheral blood white blood cell count, liver enzymes, chlamydia trachomatis titers, and chest radiograph scores. Seventy-eight (22.7%) were delivered by a cesarean, and 266 (77.3%) were delivered vaginally. There were no statistically significant differences between groups when compared by sex and age (P &gt; 0.05). Copy numbers and white blood cell counts in the peripheral blood of children with Chlamydia trachomatis in respiratory secretions of the vaginal delivery group were significantly higher than those of the cesarean delivery group (P &lt; 0.05). The alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels between groups were not statistically significant. Comparisons of admission chest radiography scores, discharge radiography scores, and score differences showed no statistical differences (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Infants delivered by cesarean comprise approximately one-fifth of those affected. The Chlamydia trachomatis titers and peripheral blood leukocyte counts of the vaginal delivery group were higher than those of the cesarean delivery group. Age of onset, liver enzymes, pulmonary inflammation, and pneumonia absorption were not different between groups. What is Known:   Chlamydia trachomatis is an important pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants.   C. trachomatis is primarily transmitted to infants through the infected mother, resulting in Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia subsequently. What is New:   Vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery can result in Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia transmission; however, cesarean delivery accounts for ~ 20% of cases.   C. trachomatis volume in the respiratory tract and the number of peripheral blood leukocytes in infants delivered vaginally were higher than those in infants delivered by cesarean."

RESULTS: In all cases, CT depicted lesions indicative of airspace involvement, which was expressed as lobar (n = 3), segmental (n = 3), patchy (n = 3), or a combination of these patterns (n = 3). Involvement of more than one lobe was observed in seven (58%) patients. In one patient with multiple patchy areas of consolidation, nodular lesions with a vascular connection and a halo of ground-glass opacity, which were suggestive of an angioinvasive process, were demonstrated. In addition, CT performed in a patient with acute Coxiella burnetii infection who abused alcohol revealed necrotizing pneumonia. Pleural effusions were seen at both CT and radiography in three patients, and mild lymph node enlargement in isolated regions was seen at CT in four patients. Chest radiography was less accurate than CT in the detection of segmental and patchy areas of consolidation. CONCLUSION: The typical CT findings of Q fever pneumonia consisted mainly of multilobar airspace consolidation.

RESULTS: Initially, 240 patients were included, of which 221 were fully followed up. Etiological diagnosis was obtained in 86 patients (39%). The bacteria most frequently isolated was Coxiella burnetii (12.2%), followed up Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Two cases of Strepcococus pneumoniae were diagnosed. The most frequent radiological onset was alveolar infiltrate (86%). The initial empiric treatment were macrolids (71%) or second generation cephalosporines (22%). Most patients presented a favourable clinical and radiological progression. Only 2 patients needed admission to the hospital (&lt; 1%). CONCLUSIONS: In community acquired pneumonias studied in our outpatient clinic we found a high number of ""atypical"" agents. Treatment with macrolids or second generation cephalosporines are appropriate for these patients."

Pathogens implicated in CAP in adults admitted to hospital in the UK using modern and traditional microbiological investigations are described. METHODS: Adults aged 16 years and over admitted to a teaching hospital with CAP over a 12 month period from 4 October 1998 were prospectively studied. Samples of blood, sputum, and urine were collected for microbiological testing by standard culture techniques and new serological and urine antigen detection methods. RESULTS: Of 309 patients admitted with CAP, 267 fulfilled the study criteria; 135 (50.6%) were men and the mean (SD) age was 65.4 (19.6) years. Aetiological agents were identified from 199 (75%) patients (one pathogen in 124 (46%), two in 53 (20%), and three or more in 22 (8%)): Streptococcus pneumoniae 129 (48%), influenza A virus 50 (19%), Chlamydia pneumoniae 35 (13%), Haemophilus influenzae 20 (7%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae 9 (3%), Legionella pneumophilia 9 (3%), other Chlamydia spp 7 (2%), Moraxella catarrhalis 5 (2%), Coxiella burnetii 2 (0.7%), others 8 (3%). Atypical pathogens were less common in patients aged 75 years and over than in younger patients (16% v 27%; OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9). The 30 day mortality was 14.9%. Mortality risk could be stratified by the presence of four ""core"" adverse features. Three of 60 patients (5%) infected with an atypical pathogen died. CONCLUSION: S pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen to cover by initial antibiotic therapy in adults of all ages admitted to hospital with CAP. Atypical pathogens are more common in younger patients. They should also be covered in all patients with severe pneumonia and younger patients with non-severe infection."

A prospective outpatient study.ABSTRACT:We initiated a prospective study with a group of practitioners to assess the etiology, clinical presentation, and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia in patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. All patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia and an infiltrate on chest X-ray underwent an extensive standard workup and were followed over 4 weeks. Over a 4-year period, 184 patients were eligible, of whom 170 (age range, 15-96 yr; median, 43 yr) were included and analyzed. In 78 (46%), no etiologic agent could be demonstrated. In the remaining 92 patients, 107 etiologic agents were implicated: 43 were due to ""pyogenic"" bacteria (39 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 Haemophilus spp., 1 Streptococcus spp.), 39 were due to ""atypical"" bacteria (24 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 9 Chlamydia pneumoniae, 4 Coxiella burnetii, 2 Legionella spp.), and 25 were due to viruses (20 influenza viruses and 5 other respiratory viruses). There were only a few statistically significant clinical differences between the different etiologic categories (higher age and comorbidities in viral or in episodes of undetermined etiology, higher neutrophil counts in ""pyogenic"" episodes, more frequent bilateral and interstitial infiltrates in viral episodes). There were 2 deaths, both in patients with advanced age (83 and 86 years old), and several comorbidities. Only 14 patients (8.2%) required hospitalization. In 6 patients (3.4%), the pneumonia episode uncovered a local neoplasia. This study shows that most cases of community-acquired pneumonia have a favorable outcome and can be successfully managed in an outpatient setting. Moreover, in the absence of rapid and reliable clinical or laboratory tests to establish a definite etiologic diagnosis at presentation, the spectrum of the etiologic agents suggest that initial antibiotic therapy should cover both S. pneumoniae and atypical bacteria, as well as possible influenza viruses during the epidemic season."

He was admitted on the same day because his laboratory data showed marked inflammatory changes and his chest radiograph revealed an infiltrative shadow in the right upper lung field. Initial treatment with beta-lactams was not effective and both his symptoms and his chest radiograph worsened. However, treatment with erythromycin clearly had an effect. Then, we carried out several tests for detection of atypical pathogens including Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. Finally, the case was diagnosed as one of Coxiella burnetii pneumonia because the DNA of C. burnetii was detected from his sera and seroconversion of C. burnetii--specific antibody was observed among paired serum samples. C. burnetii is one of the most commonly recognized pathogens among community-acquired pneumonias in Western countries, but in Japan, reports of community-acquired C. burnetii pneumonia have been rare. This difference may be due to the features of Q fever, in which there are large differences in frequency and form from country to country and among areas of the same country. Surveillance of C. burnetii pneumonia in Japan and different area will be required."

METHOD: Clinical-radiological evaluation protocols were activated in the first visit and in two subsequent controls. Etiological diagnosis was made by means of serology (in the first visit and three weeks later). RESULTS: Initially, 85 patients older than 60 years were included of which 75 non hospitalized were fully followed up. Also, in the comparative study, 216 outpatient clinic patients 60 years old or younger were followed up during the same period. In the first group the frequency of atypical agents was 33.3%. The most frequently isolated bacteria was Coxiella burnetii (13.3%)followed by virus and Legionella pneumophila. No case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was diagnosed. The most frequent radiological onset was alveolar infiltrate (85%). The comparative study between the two populations (older or younger than 60 years), found few clinical differences (dyspnea more frequent in older,feverish chill in younger) and auscultation (crackles more frequent in older). We did not find differences remaining clinical-radiological or laboratory data. Most patients presented a favourable clinical and radiological progression. Only 2 patients needed hospital admission (2.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In outpatient clinic patients older than 60 years with community acquired pneumonia a high number of atypical agents have been found. The clinical-radiological evolution was satisfactory for most of them. Age was not a decisive element in determining hospital admissions."

Biological abnormalities were elevated liver enzyme levels and thrombocytopenia. The patient improved or the third day of antibiotic treatment. She mentioned that 3 other people she lived with during her trip had been diagnosed with Q fever. A common source outbreak was then suspected. They all stayed in the same farm in French Guyana. Animal exposure occurred there, in particular with a goat and a dog (both were parturient). The disease was probably transmitted by airborne dust to our patient, as no other vectors of transmission were found. Since the clinical presentation of Q fever is not specific, in order for the physician to diagnose it, he must have an awareness of the disease. Our case emphasised that looking for risk factors of Coxiella burnetii exposures is particularly important. Amongst them, the most important seems to be contact with farm animals.

Farm animals and pets are the main reservoirs of infection, and transmission to human beings is mainly accomplished through inhalation of contaminated aerosols. This illness is associated with a wide clinical spectrum, from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic seroconversion to fatal disease. Q fever in children has been rarely reported. We reviewed published work on this topic. Seroepidemiological studies show that children are frequently exposed to C burnetii. However, children are less frequently symptomatic than adults following infection, and may have milder diseases. Using the standard diagnostic criteria, we identified 46 published paediatric cases only. Self-limited febrile illness and pneumonia were the most common manifestations of acute Q fever. Chronic disease manifested as endocarditis and osteomyelitis. A history of exposure to possible sources of infection with C burnetii in a child with a compatible infectious syndrome should prompt testing for Q fever. Studies are required to determine the spectrum of morbidity associated with Q fever during childhood."

The diagnosis was made using serologic methods to detect antibodies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydia psittaci, and Coxiella burnetii. Among 81 recruited patients, C. pneumoniae (n = 10, 12.3%) was the leading cause of illness, followed by M. pneumoniae (n = 7, 8.6%). One case of C. burnetii pneumonia was detected, but there were no cases of Legionella spp. or C. psittaci. Three cases of C. pneumoniae pneumonia were co-infected with either M. pneumoniae or C. burnetii. There was no significant difference between atypical pneumonia and non-diagnosed pneumonia in terms of clinical manifestations. In conclusion, of the atypical pathogens causing CAP, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae appear to be the important etiologic pathogens in Korea."

Q fever, a zoonosis, is due to infection with C. burnetii. This spore-forming microorganism is a small gram-negative coccobacillus that is an obligate intracellular parasite. The most common animal reservoirs are goats, cattle, sheep, cats, and occasionally dogs. The organism reaches high concentrations in the placenta of infected animals. Aerosolisation occurs at the time of parturition and infection follows inhalation of this aerosol. There are three distinct clinical syndromes of the acute form of the illness: nonspecific febrile illness, pneumonia, and hepatitis. The chronic form of Q fever is almost always endocarditis, but occasionally it is manifest as hepatitis, osteomyelitis or endovascular infection. The pneumonic form of the illness can range from very mild-to-severe pneumonia requiring assisted ventilation. Multiple round opacities are a common finding on chest radiography. Treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone is preferred. Susceptibility to macrolides is variable. In conclusion, Coxiella burnetii pneumonia should be considered when there is a suitable exposure history and when outbreaks of a pneumonic illness are being investigated."

The frequency of Q fever pneumonia in community-acquired pneumonia was 1.4%. The 21-year-old woman was a typical case of Q fever pneumonia, since her clinical features showed 1. the breeding of cats, 2. development from a fever and non-productive caught in March, 3. multiple soft consolidations in the chest radiograph, 4. normal WBC count, 5. cure by administration of clarithromycin. The pneumonias of the other 3 cases were considered to be mixed infections, with bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Their clinical features were 1. elderly male patients with underlying diseases, 2. development from fever and cough with purulent sputum in winter, 3. coarse crackle on auscultation, 4. consolidation with pleural effusion in chest radiograph, 5. leukocytosis, elevation of BUN, hyponatremia, 6. a few cases with unfavorable prognoses despite medication with carbapenem and minocycline. These findings suggested that two types of pneumonia exist; one with the usual features of atypical pneumonia, and the other presenting the clinical features of bacterial pneumonia of the elderly due to a mixed infection including C. burnetti."

The serum samples which were collected from 53 adult patients and 20 healthy donors have been investigated by a commercial indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA, Pneumo-slide, Vircell SL, Spain) in which nine different antigens were fixed onto a slide. In both of the study groups. IgG and IgM seropositivities were detected in different rates against one or more etiologic agents. In the patient group. IgG and IgM positivity rates for the agents were as follows, respectively; 22.6% and 28.3% for Legionella pneumophila, 9.4% and 5.6% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 30.1% and 7.5% for Coxiella burnetii, 33.9% and 3.7% for Chlamydia pneumoniae, 28.3% and 0 for adenovirus, 71.6% and 1.8% for respiratory syncytial virus, 30.1% and 24.5% for influenza A virus, 35.8% and 7.5% for influenza B virus, 71.6% and 1.8% for parainfluenza viruses type 1-3. The rates of IgG positivities in the control group varied between 5-55% for all of the agents except M. pneumoniae and 3 of these controls were positive for L. pneumophila IgM, 3 were positive for C. pneumoniae IgM and one was positive for influenza A virus IgM. According to the statistical evaluation, there were no significant differences for IgM seropositivities to any of the agents, between the patient and control groups (p &gt; 0.05). These results could be attributed to one or more of the following; a) none of these microorganisms were the primary etiologic agents, b) IgM positivities were the result of reinfections with these agents, c) longer duration of IgM antibodies after the acute infections. In terms of IgG positivities between the patient and control groups, only C. burnetii showed statistically significant difference (p = 0.029). Since the type of the pathogens causing CAP are of crucial importance both for the epidemiological purposes and for planning the empirical treatment strategies, more detailed multicenter studies should be performed in our country."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 630 patients from nearly all regions of Croatia with a clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonia based on epidemiologic data, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and chest X-rays. Most of them were from Zagreb (n = 370), followed by those from Slavonia, Istria, northwest Croatia, and Dalmatia. In all of them paired sera were collected at an interval of two weeks or more and tested for complement-fixing (CF) antibodies against the most common causative agents of the atypical pneumonia syndrome using CF test (micromethod). RESULTS: An etiologic diagnosis was established in 25% (158/630) patients (81 male and 77 female). Respiratory viruses were the most frequently demonstrated pathogens in 2002, accounting for 72% of cases (adenoviruses 47%, parainfluenza viruses 14%, influenza viruses 9% and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 2%). These were followed by Chlamydophila (C.) psittaci; (19%), Mycoplasma (M.) pneumoniae; (6%) and Coxiella (C.) burnetii (3%). There were 3 cases of double infection: a combination of adenovirus and M. pneumoniae, of RSV and parainfluenza virus, and of RSV and M. pneumoniae in one patient each. Adenoviral, mycoplasmal and psittacosal pneumonia occurred throughout the year; influenza and most of RSV pneumonias occurred in winter months. Parainfluenza viruses caused pneumonias throughout the year but were more common in winter months. CF test does not distinguish type-specific antibodies to parainfluenza viruses. In March, a small epidemic of psittacosis (11 patients) was registered in the Split area while was responsible for the high incidence of psittacosal pneumonia in 2002. While M. pneumoniae-caused pneumonia occurred mainly in children and adolescents, viral pneumonias were distributed across all age groups. Psittacosal pneumonia occurred in only one child but was more common in adolescents and especially adults. Q-fever pneumonia occurred only in adults."

Q fever is endemic in northern Croatia, but the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in various ecological areas of southern Croatia are unclear. MATERIAL/METHODS: From January 1985 to December 2002, acute Q fever cases hospitalized at Split University Hospital were analyzed. Acute Q fever was defined as fever (&gt;38 degrees C) with clinical findings in lung and/or liver verified by serologic testing with Coxiella burnetii phase II antigen. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 155 acute Q fever cases were hospitalized. The mean incidence of acute Q fever in the study region was 0.20/100,000/year (95%CI:0-0.78) in the coastal area and 4.64/100,000/year (95%CI:0.44-8.85) in the non-coastal areas, with a male predominance (chi2=60.0; p=0.0000) and a mean male to female ratio of 4.2:1. People of essentially all ages (4-76 years) were affected, the highest rate of infection being recorded in 20- to 49-year-old age groups. In contrast to adults, girls were more frequently affected than boys (2:1). No case of acute Q fever was recorded on any of the nearby islands. Clinically, acute Q fever most commonly presented with both pneumonia and hepatitis (60.0%), followed by pneumonia (25.8%), hepatitis (9.0%), and nonspecific febrile illnesses (5.2%).

","SPECIES:Coxiella burnetiiID:16669925TITLE:The atypical pneumonias: clinical diagnosis and importance.ABSTRACT:The most common atypical pneumonias are caused by three zoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and three nonzoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella. These atypical agents, unlike the typical pathogens, often cause extrapulmonary manifestations. Atypical CAPs are systemic infectious diseases with a pulmonary component and may be differentiated clinically from typical CAPs by the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement which is characteristic for each atypical CAP. Zoonotic pneumonias may be eliminated from diagnostic consideration with a negative contact history. The commonest clinical problem is to differentiate legionnaire's disease from typical CAP as well as from C. pneumoniae or M. pneumonia infection. Legionella is the most important atypical pathogen in terms of severity. It may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP and other atypical pathogens by the use of a weighted point system of syndromic diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary features. Because legionnaire's disease often presents as severe CAP, a presumptive diagnosis of Legionella should prompt specific testing and empirical anti-Legionella therapy such as the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's weighted point score system. Most atypical pathogens are difficult or dangerous to isolate and a definitive laboratory diagnosis is usually based on indirect, i.e., direct flourescent antibody (DFA), indirect flourescent antibody (IFA). Atypical CAP is virtually always monomicrobial; increased IFA IgG tests indicate past exposure and not concurrent infection. Anti-Legionella antibiotics include macrolides, doxycycline, rifampin, quinolones, and telithromycin. The drugs with the highest level of anti-Legionella activity are quinolones and telithromycin. Therapy is usually continued for 2 weeks if potent anti-Legionella drugs are used. In adults, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may exacerbate or cause asthma. The importance of the atypical pneumonias is not related to their frequency (approximately 15% of CAPs), but to difficulties in their diagnosis, and their nonresponsiveness to beta-lactam therapy. Because of the potential role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), and the role of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in causing or exacerbating asthma, atypical CAPs also have public health importance."

The characteristics of Q fever and the changes in this infection seen over the last decade in our hospital are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 124 cases of Q fever diagnosed in the Infectious Diseases Unit of a tertiary hospital Hospital Universitario Infanta Cristina de Badajoz) during the years 1992-2005 were analyzed. The epidemiological, clinical, serological and therapeutic data of the patients, and the factors related with hospital admittance are described. RESULTS: Mean age was 41 +/- 16 years, most patients were males (4:1 ratio), 61% lived in rural areas and 47% mentioned some kind of contact with farm animals. The clinical presentation included non-focalized fever (53%), hepatitis (43%), pneumonia (11%), and endocarditis (6%). The factors related with the need for hospital admission were diagnosis after 1999 (OR: 12.2; 95% CI: 3.2-47.6), pneumonia (OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.1-15.9), and hepatitis (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2-6.3). During the second half of the study period there were more cases of Q fever, the interval of time to diagnosis was shorter (P = 0.042), and there was a significant increase in hospitalizations (55% versus 9%; P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In Extremadura, Q fever is an emerging infection that predominates in males who are in contact with animals for work purposes. Non-focalized fever is the most frequent form of clinical presentation; pneumonia is rare. Hospitalization for Q fever infection has increased over the last years."

An 11-year prospective study.ABSTRACT:The aim of this study is to describe the changes in the aetiology of hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) during an 11-year observational period in a limited geographic area. Eight hundred and one (801) adult patients with CAP hospitalised were included. The patients were divided into three groups according to the time of presentation. Comprehensive microbiological laboratory tests were performed and differences in aetiology were analysed. In 228 patients (31%), a pathogen was detected, with Coxiella burnetii being the most common (20.1%). Significant variations in the prevalence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae were found between groups but not in other pathogens. In conclusion, long-term epidemiological studies may contribute to the knowledge of actual CAP aetiology."

","SPECIES:Coxiella burnetiiID:17628200TITLE:Q fever community-acquired pneumonia in a patient with Crohn's disease on immunosuppressive therapy.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may be caused by typical or atypical pathogens. The three most common zoonotic atypical pathogens are Chlamydophila psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Atypical CAPs are suggested by a distinctive pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. Zoonotic CAP may be differentiated from nonzoonotic CAP (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionnaire's disease) by a recent zoonotic vector contact history. Zoonotic atypical CAP occurs sporadically, but not randomly, and require close association with the appropriate zoonotic vector to transmit the infection. CAP accompanied by the extrapulmonary finding of splenomegaly in a normal host limits differential diagnostic possibilities to Q fever and psittacosis. Splenomegaly does not occur with other typical or atypical CAP. Another common extrapulmonary finding occurs with some atypical pneumonias, that is, Q fever, psittacosis, and Legionnaire's disease is early mild/transient elevations of serum transaminases indicative of (hepatic) extrapulmonary organ involvement. The case presented is a middle-aged man with longstanding Crohn's disease who was further immunosuppressed by chronic prednisone therapy. The patient presented with CAP and extrapulmonary findings, that is, splenomegaly and increased serum transaminases. He denied recent contact with birds or animals. Because Crohn's disease and Q fever CAP may be accompanied by splenomegaly, the cause of his splenomegaly was a diagnostic dilemma. The patient was treated with levofloxacin. Serologic tests for atypical pathogens (Q fever, psittacosis, Legionnaire's disease, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) were ordered. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology for Q fever was positive with elevated acute immunoglobulin-M (phase II) titers. Re-questioning of the patient revealed a recent exposure to a neighbor's parturient cat, providing the necessary zoonotic vector contact history for Q fever. The patient responded to levofloxacin, which resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms, right lower lobe pneumonia, and splenomegaly. Because a prior abdominal computed tomography scan indicated no splenomegaly and his splenomegaly resolved with antimicrobial therapy, the splenomegaly was related to Q fever CAP."

However, as technology has improved, so has our understanding of this clinical entity. It is now known that there are many agents linked with atypical pneumonia in the community, and many of these agents are also major causes of healthcare-associated pneumonia. This article discusses the history, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of infection; control of infection; clinical findings; diagnosis; and, where applicable, treatment of the agents of healthcare-associated atypical pneumonia. Bacterial agents include Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila species, and Coxiella burnetii. Although there are over 100 viruses that can cause respiratory tract infections, only a fraction of those have been defined in the context of healthcare-associated atypical pneumonia: adenovirus and human bocavirus (HBoV); rhinovirus; human coronaviruses (HCoV), including HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1; members of the paramyxoviridae (parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus); hantavirus; influenza; and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Co-V. Our knowledge about healthcare-associated atypical pneumonia will continue to evolve as newer pathogens are identified and as newer diagnostic modalities such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction are introduced."

This study evaluated a molecular test for the identification of the bacterial cause of atypical community-acquired pneumonia (ACAP). Fifty-four children with pneumonia were studied using bacteriological cultures, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella spp. serology, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella antigens. Simultaneously, the presence of bacterial and fungal DNA was tested for in respiratory secretion samples using the Vircell SL kit, including multiplex PCR and amplicon detection by means of line blots. There were 14 cases of ACAP caused by M. pneumoniae, with positive kit results for 13 of them, and two cases of Q-fever, with negative kit results for Coxiella burnetii. The test was negative in the remaining 38 cases (one staphylococcal pneumonia, 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonias, and 17 probable viral pneumonias). The sensitivity of the test for the detection of M. pneumoniae was 92.8% and the specificity was 100%. The Vircell SL kit allows detection of M. pneumoniae DNA in respiratory secretion samples from children with ACAP."

Apart from well-established agents of pneumonia such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci and Coxiella burnetii, some new emerging pathogens have recently been recognized, mainly Parachlamydia acanthamoebae and Simkania negevensis, two Chlamydia-related bacteria. Most of them are causes of benign and self-limited infections. However, they may cause severe pneumonia in some cases (i.e., Legionnaires' disease) and they may cause outbreaks representing a public health problem deserving prompt recognition and appropriate therapy. Although extrapulmonary manifestations are often present, no clinical features allow them to be distinguished from classical bacterial agents of pneumonia such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, specific molecular diagnostic tools are very helpful for early recognition of the offending bacteria, whereas serology often only allows retrospective or late diagnosis. Macrolides remain the best empirical treatment of intracellular respiratory pathogens, although some observational studies suggest that quinolones may be superior for the treatment of legionellosis."

Similarly to elsewhere in the world, domestic animals are considered to be important reservoirs of the causal agent, Coxiella burnetii, a resistant intracellular bacterium. Infected animals shed bacteria in milk, feces, urine, vaginal mucous and birth products. Inhalation of bacteria present in the environment is the main route of animal and human infection. Shedding of C. burnetii in milk by domestic ruminants has a very limited impact as raw milk is seldom ingested by the Japanese population. The clinical expression of Q fever in Japan is similar to its clinical expression elsewhere. However clinical cases in children are more frequently reported in this country. Moreover, C. burnetii is specified as one of the causative organisms of atypical pneumonia in the Japanese Respiratory Society Guideline for the management of community-acquired pneumonia. In Japan, C. burnetii isolates are associated with acute illness and are mainly of moderate to low virulence. Cats are considered a significant source of C. burnetii responsible for human outbreaks in association with the presence of infected parturient cats. Since its recognition as a reportable disease in 1999, 7-46 clinical cases of Q fever have been reported by year. The epidemiology of Q fever in Japan remains to be elucidated and the exact modes of transmission are still unproven. Important further research is necessary to improve knowledge of the disease itself, the endogenous hosts and reservoirs, and the epidemiological cycle of coxiellosis in Japan."

Most patients with CAP are treated empirically. OBJECTIVES: To identify common pathogens causing CAP in hospitalized patients in northern Israel and to evaluate the correlation between etiology and disease severity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients with CAP hospitalized at HaEmek Medical Center, Afula. We collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data (blood and sputum cultures, serology, pneumococcal urinary antigen test, and respiratory multiplex-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swab). Radiologic evaluation was performed. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients and 24 controls were enrolled. At least one pathogen was identified in 84 cases (66.7%), more than one in 43 patients (34.1%), and no pathogens in 42 (33.3%). Typical bacteria were found in 23 (18.3%), atypical bacteria in 66 (52.4%), and viruses in 42 (33.3%). The number (%) of patients with pathogens isolated was: Chlamydophila pneumoniae 26 (20.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 23 (18.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae 23 (18.3%), influenza virus A-B 20 (15.9%), Coxiella burnetti 8 (6.3%), and parainfluenza and adenovirus 13 (10.3%) each. A correlation was found only between a high PORT score on admission and S. pneumoniae, although atypical pathogens did not show class predominance. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were the most common pathogens isolated, while co-infection was very frequent. PORT score did not predict any of the pathogens involved. The choice of empiric antimicrobial treatment for CAP should be made according to local epidemiologic data."

Data from 3264 notifications for acute Q fever in the period from 2007 through 2009 were analysed. The patients most affected were men, smokers and persons aged 40-60 years. Pneumonia was the most common clinical presentation (62% in 2007 and 2008). Only 3.2% of the patients were working in the agriculture sector and 0.5% in the meat-processing industry including abattoirs. Dairy goat farms with Coxiella burnetii-induced abortion waves were mainly located in the same area where human cases occurred. Airborne transmission of contaminated dust particles from commercial dairy goat farms in densely populated areas has probably caused this epidemic. In 2010, there was a sharp decline in the number of notified cases following the implementation of control measures on dairy goat and sheep farms such as vaccination, hygiene measures and culling of pregnant animals on infected farms. In combination with a rise in the human population with antibodies against C. burnetii, these have most likely ended the outbreak.

Consequently, the empirical antibiotherapy used for the treatment of CAP combines doxycycline and the recommended amoxicillin. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of Q fever pneumonia and to build a prediction rule to identify patients with Q fever pneumonia for empirical antibiotic guidance. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted on inpatients admitted with CAP in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Cayenne Hospital from 2004 to 2007. Serodiagnosis for Coxiella burnetii was performed for all patients. Risk factor analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression, and a prognostic score was computed using bootstrap procedures. The score performance characteristics were used to choose the best prediction rule to identify patients with Q fever pneumonia. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients with CAP were included and the Q fever pneumonia prevalence was 24.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.1-31.9). In multivariate analysis, male sex, middle age (age, 30-60 years), headache, leukocyte count &lt;10 x 10(9)/L and C-reactive protein level &gt;185 mg/L were independently associated with Q fever pneumonia. Patients with a predictive score &lt;=3 had a low risk of Q fever pneumonia with a negative predictive value of 0.97 (95% CI, .90-1) and a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI, .89-1).

In this study, we tried to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacteria in patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Between April 2008 and April 2009, 408 adult patients (aged between 20 and 94 years) with community-acquired pneumonia were tested for the presence of respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, real-time PCR for viruses and bacteria, urinary antigen testing for Legionella and Pneumococci and serology for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 263 (64 5%) of the 408 patients. The most common single organisms in these 263 patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 8%), Coxiella burnetii (6 8%) and influenza A virus (3 8%). Of the 263 patients detected with pathogens, 117 (44 5%) patients were positive for one or more viral pathogens. Of these 117 patients, 52 (44 4%) had no bacterial pathogen.

AIM: To examine differences in microbial etiology in patients with CAP between patients with and without proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and its possible impact on disease severity. METHODS: All individuals consulting the emergency care unit were prospectively registered and underwent chest radiography. Sputum, urine, nose-throat swabs and blood samples were obtained for microbial evaluation. We evaluated the association between use of proton pump inhibitors, etiology of CAP and severity of illness with multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 463 patients, 29% using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Pathogens regarded as oropharyngeal flora were more common in CAP patients using PPI therapy compared to those who did not (adjusted OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.22-3.72). Patients using proton pump inhibitors more frequently had an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (28% vs. 14%) and less frequently with Coxiella burnetii (8% vs. 19%) compared to nonuser of PPI. Adjusted for baseline differences, the risk of PPI users being infected with S. pneumonia was 2.23 times (95% CI: 1.28-3.75) higher compared to patients without PPI's. No risk between PPI use and any other microbial pathogen was found. There was no difference in severity of CAP between patients with and without using PPI therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Proton pump inhibitor therapy was associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk to develop community-acquired pneumonia possibly as a result of S. pneumoniae infection."

Chronic Q fever develops in people who have been infected for more than 6 months. It usually takes about 20 days after exposure to the bacteria for symptoms to occur. Most cases are mild, yet some severe cases have been reported. Symptoms of acute Q fever may include: chest pain with breathing, cough, fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pains, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of chronic Q fever may include chills, fatigue, night sweats, prolonged fever, and shortness of breath. Q fever is diagnosed with a blood antibody test. The main treatment for the disease is with antibiotics. For acute Q fever, doxycycline is recommended. For chronic Q fever, a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine is often used long term. Complications are cirrhosis, hepatitis, encephalitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, meningitis, and pneumonia. People at risk should always: carefully dispose of animal products that may be infected, disinfect any contaminated areas, and thoroughly wash their hands.

Since the risk factors are similar, the probability of Coxiella burnetii seroposititivity is assumed to be also high in this area. The aim of this study was to investigate Q fever and brucellosis seropositivity in patients with acute fever. A total of 53 patients (37 male, 16 female; age range: 18-65 years, mean age: 47.13 +- 16.40 years) who were admitted to the emergency room and infection diseases outpatient clinics of Gaziosmanpasa University hospital with acute fever between June 2011-June 2012 were included in the study. Symptoms, physical examination findings and laboratory test results of the patients were recorded. In addition, their place of residence, relationship with rural area, and history of contacts with animals were questioned. The presence of C.burnetii phase II lgM and lgG antibodies were investigated by indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay, and Brucella spp. antibodies by Rose Bengal and standard tube agglutination methods in the serum samples of patients. C.burnetii seropositivity was determined in 19 (36%) of the patients, and 2 (4%) of them were diagnosed as acute Q fever with the positivity of both lgG and lgM antibodies. Among the seropositive and seronegative patients, there was no statistically significant differences in terms of age, gender, animal contact, occupation, place of residence and relationship with rural-life (p&gt; 0.05). Acute fever was attributed to pneumonia in 10 patients and of them five were found positive for phase II lgG antibodies. There was no significant difference between C.burnetii seropositive and seronegative patients in terms of the presence of pneumonia (p= 0.30). In two patients diagnosed as acute Q fever no signs of pneumoniae were detected in the chest X-rays; one of these cases was resided in the city and the other in the rural area while both had contact with animals. The most frequently detected symptoms in patients with acute Q fever were malaise, fatigue, chills, cough, sputum, dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Brucella seropositivity was detected in 6 (11%) patients and four of them were diagnosed as acute brucellosis. Four of the Brucella seropositive patients were also found positive for C.burnetii. Sixteen (84%) of C.burnetii seropositive patients were male and 3 (16%) were female. Eleven of them were living in the village and eight in the city, however six out of eight urban patients had a history of relation with rural-life, resulting a total of 17 (89%) rural-contacts. In addition, 79% (15/19) of seropositive cases had the history of animal contact most commonly with cattle and sheep (11/15; 73%). When the laboratory findings were compared, serum ferritin levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with acute Q fever then those seronegative patients (874 ng/ml mean value vs. 150 ng/mL mean value; p= 0.04), however there was no significant difference between the other laboratory parameters (p&gt; 0.05). Our data indicated that Q fever seropositivity was quite high in Tokat region and the reason may be attributed to entwined life between rural and urban areas. In conclusion in the patients presenting with acute fever, brucellosis and Q fever should be considered in differential diagnosis, since both infections are endemic in that area of Turkey."

However, the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria that exist in many of these countries remains incompletely characterized. The aim of this study was to examine the spectrum of pathogenic viruses and atypical bacteria associated with acute respiratory infection in children under the age of 16. METHODS: A total of 10 435 serum sera specimens were collected from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect immunoglobulin M antibodies against nine common pathogens: mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila, coxiella burnetii and chamydophila pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 10 435 specimens examined, 7046 tested positive for at least one pathogen. Among all of the tested pathogens, mycoplasma pneumonia had the highest detection rate (56.9%). Influenza virus A and influenza virus B epidemics occurred during both winter and summer. The detection rate of respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus was higher in spring. Cases of mixed infection were more complex: 4136 specimens (39.6%) tested positive for &gt;=2 pathogens. There were statistically significant difference in detection rates of mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza virus A, legionella pneumophila and chamydophila pneumonia among different age groups (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The most common pathogens causing acute respiratory infection among children in Hubei of China were mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus B and respiratory syncytial virus. The detection rates for each pathogen displayed specific seasonal and age group variations."

The majority of the reported cases are related to outbreaks. The objective of our study was to evaluate the general role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We investigated respiratory samples and sera from 255 patients with CAP, who were enrolled into a CAPNETZ cohort in summer 2005. Altogether, our data showed a significant prevalence of Q fever as CAP (3 5%). If a patient's condition leads to a diagnostic test for Chlamydophila sp., Mycoplasma sp. or Legionella sp., then a Q fever diagnostic test should also be included. In particular, ELISA as a first diagnostic step is easy to perform. PCR should be performed at an early stage of the disease if no antibodies are detectable. Because of our highly promising findings we suggest performing PCR in respiratory samples."

Ticks have been considered as a reservoir and a vector of C. burnetii. The outbreaks of Q fever were noted in different parts of Europe both in animals and humans. Q fever is zoonotic diseases characterized by sudden fever, headache, atypical pneumonia and abortions. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of C. burnetii infection in foresters in the south-eastern endemic region of Poland and comparison of diagnostic methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The serum samples were collected from 304 humans (foresters) from the 12 superintendency in the south-eastern Poland. Additionally, 1,200 ticks Ixodes ricinus were collected from the same area. The sera samples were tested by using serological methods (CFT, ELISA and IFA) and the ticks were tested with the use of real-time PCR. RESULTS: The results demonstrates that infections with C. burnetii are present in foresters in the south-eastern Poland. The serological results showed both chronic and acute form of Q fever. The statistical analysis of the positive results obtained by three different serological methods revealed that values of chi2 were statistically significant between IFA and ELISA and CFT and IFA. The final percentage of examined foresters classified as positive was 10.52%. No significant differences were observed between CFT and ELISA (p=0.25).The percentage of infected ticks was 15.9%. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that infections with C. burnetii are present in foresters in the south-eastern Poland. The comparison of serological methods showed that their diagnostic potential is differentiated but the most useful tool is IFA."

Epidemiological and clinical features of 32 hospitalized patients.ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii. The main characteristic of acute Q fever is its clinical polymorphism, usually presenting as a febrile illness with varying degrees of hepatitis and/or pneumonia. Q fever is endemic in Portugal, and it is an obligatory notifiable disease since 1999. However, its epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still incompletely described. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 32 cases admitted in the Infectious Diseases Department, Santa Maria's University Hospital, from January 2001 to December 2010, in whom acute Q fever was diagnosed by the presence of antibodies to phase II Coxiella burnetii antigens associated with a compatible clinical syndrome. RESULTS: Out of the 32 cases recorded, 29 (91%) were male, with a male:female ratio of 9.7:1. Individuals at productive age were mainly affected (88%, n=28, with ages between 25 and 64 years). Clinically, the most common manifestation of acute Q fever was hepatic involvement (84%, n=27), which occurred isolated in 53% (n=17) of the cases. Hepatitis was more severe, presenting with higher values of liver function tests, in patients presenting both pulmonary and hepatic involvement. Additionally, we report one case of myocarditis and another one with neurological involvement. Empiric but appropriate antibiotic therapy was given in 66% (n=21) of the cases. There was a complete recovery in 94% (n=30) of the patients, and one death. We confirmed the sub-notification of this disease in Portugal, with only 47% (n=15) of the cases notified. CONCLUSION: In Portugal further studies are needed to confirm our results. From the 32 cases studied, acute Q fever presented more frequently as a febrile disease with hepatic involvement affecting mainly young male individuals. Furthermore, acute Q fever is clearly underdiagnosed and underreported in Portugal, which suggests that an increased awareness of the disease is needed, together with a broader use of serological testing."

RECENT FINDINGS: There have been significant developments in molecular diagnosis to include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in multiplex PCR of respiratory specimens. There are diagnostic challenges in distinguishing carriage from infection, which is recognized in C. pneumoniae and now also evident in M. pneumoniae. Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has emerged in Asia. There are new antimicrobials on the horizon in the ketolide class with activity against typical and atypical pathogens and useful empirical agents. SUMMARY: There are few advances in our knowledge of the epidemiology of atypical pathogens or the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy--empirical or pathogen specific. However, if molecular testing becomes widely implemented, there will be an increased understanding of the epidemiology and presentation of atypical pneumonia and a shift to more targeted antimicrobial therapy."

Coxiella burnetii, the causative pathogen, is transmitted among varied host species, but the epidemiology of the organism in Africa is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review of C. burnetii epidemiology in Africa from a ""One Health"" perspective to synthesize the published data and identify knowledge gaps. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched nine databases to identify articles relevant to four key aspects of C. burnetii epidemiology in human and animal populations in Africa: infection prevalence; disease incidence; transmission risk factors; and infection control efforts. We identified 929 unique articles, 100 of which remained after full-text review. Of these, 41 articles describing 51 studies qualified for data extraction. Animal seroprevalence studies revealed infection by C. burnetii (&lt;=13%) among cattle except for studies in Western and Middle Africa (18-55%). Small ruminant seroprevalence ranged from 11-33%. Human seroprevalence was &lt;8% with the exception of studies among children and in Egypt (10-32%). Close contact with camels and rural residence were associated with increased seropositivity among humans. C. burnetii infection has been associated with livestock abortion. In human cohort studies, Q fever accounted for 2-9% of febrile illness hospitalizations and 1-3% of infective endocarditis cases. We found no studies of disease incidence estimates or disease control efforts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: C. burnetii infection is detected in humans and in a wide range of animal species across Africa, but seroprevalence varies widely by species and location. Risk factors underlying this variability are poorly understood as is the role of C. burnetii in livestock abortion. Q fever consistently accounts for a notable proportion of undifferentiated human febrile illness and infective endocarditis in cohort studies, but incidence estimates are lacking. C. burnetii presents a real yet underappreciated threat to human and animal health throughout Africa."

This knowledge is indispensable to estimate cost-effectiveness of new strategies aiming to prevent and/or improve clinical outcome of CAP. METHODS: We performed our observational analysis in a cohort of 505 patients hospitalised with confirmed CAP between 2004 and 2010. Hospital administrative databases were extracted for all resource utilisation on a patient level. Resource items were grouped in seven categories: general ward nursing, nursing on ICU, clinical chemistry laboratory tests, microbiology exams, radiology exams, medication drugs, and other.linear regression analyses were conducted to identify variables predicting costs of hospitalisation for CAP. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most identified causative pathogen (25%), followed by Coxiella burnetii (6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Overall median length of hospital stay was 8.5 days, in-hospital mortality rate was 4.8%.Total median hospital costs per patient were $3,899 (IQR 2,911-5,684). General ward nursing costs represented the largest share (57%), followed by nursing on the intensive care unit (16%) and diagnostic microbiological tests (9%). In multivariate regression analysis, class IV-V Pneumonia Severity Index (indicative for severe disease), Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pneumonia as causative pathogen, were independent cost driving factors. Coxiella burnetii was a cost-limiting factor. CONCLUSIONS: Median costs of hospitalisation for CAP are almost $4,000 per patient. Nursing costs are the main cause of these costs.. Apart from prevention, low-cost interventions aimed at reducing length of hospital stay therefore will most likely be cost-effective."

Fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute Q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. In southern Taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has never been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, May 2012 to April 2013, 166 cases of adult CAP and 15 cases of acute Q fever were prospectively investigated. Cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with CAP. From April 2004 to April 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute Q fever were also included retrospectively for analysis. The geographic distribution of Q fever and CAP cases was similar. Q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than CAP. Based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were independent characteristics associated with Q fever. In patients with Q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. Twelve (7.2%) cases of CAP were seropositive for C. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute Q fever. Among CAP cases, 22.9% had a CURB-65 score  2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), S. pneumoniae (6.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. Moreover, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Taiwan, Q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as the major presentation and is not a common etiology of CAP."

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 183 cases of acute Q fever from three Spanish regions, Catalonia, Canary Islands, and La Rioja. RESULTS: The main clinical form of presentation was hepatitis (49.2%), followed by isolate febrile syndrome (31.7%) and pneumonia (19.1%). The proportion of cases presenting as pneumonia was significantly higher in La Rioja (40.7%) than in Catalonia (18.3%) or the Canary Islands (12.9%) (p=0.001). In Catalonia and the Canary Islands, most cases (52.1% and 57.6%, respectively) were diagnosed between March and June, whereas in La Rioja, most cases (51.8%) occurred between November and February. Overall, the proportion of cases presenting as pneumonia was significantly higher in the period from November to February (32.6%) than in the periods March-June (16.0%) and July-October (13.0%) (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of seasonal differences in the presentation of acute Q fever in Spain, with a higher proportion of pneumonic forms in the colder months.

The clinical presentation may be acute (pneumonia and/or hepatitis) or chronic (most commonly endocarditis). Diagnosis mainly relies on serology and PCR. We therefore developed a quantitative real-time PCR. We first tested blindly its performance on various clinical samples and then, when thoroughly validated, we applied it during a 7-year period for the diagnosis of both acute and persistent C. burnetii infection. Analytical sensitivity (&lt; 10 copies/PCR) was excellent. When tested blindly on 183 samples, the specificity of the PCR was 100% (142/142) and the sensitivity was 71% (29/41). The sensitivity was 88% (7/8) on valvular samples, 69% (20/29) on blood samples and 50% (2/4) on urine samples. This new quantitative PCR was then successfully applied for the diagnosis of acute Q fever and endovascular infection due to C. burnetii, allowing the diagnosis of Q fever in six patients over a 7-year period. During a local small cluster of cases, the PCR was also applied to blood from 1355 blood donors; all were negative confirming the high specificity of this test. In conclusion, we developed a highly specific method with excellent sensitivity, which may be used on sera for the diagnosis of acute Q fever and on various samples such as sera, valvular samples, aortic specimens, bone and liver, for the diagnosis of persistent C. burnetii infection.

During the large Q fever epidemic in The Netherlands, many patients with a laboratory-confirmed Coxiella burnetii infection were not notified as acute Q fever because they did not fulfil the clinical criteria of the acute Q fever case definition (fever, pneumonia and/or hepatitis). Our study assessed and compared the long-term health status of notified and non-notified Q fever patients at 4 years after onset of illness, using the Nijmegen Clinical Screening Instrument (NCSI). The study included 448 notified and 193 non-notified Q fever patients. The most severely affected subdomain in both patient groups was 'Fatigue' (50 5% of the notified and 54 6% of the non-notified patients had severe fatigue). Long-term health status did not differ significantly between the notified and non-notified patient groups, and patients scored worse on all subdomains compared to a healthy reference group. Our findings suggest that the magnitude of the 2007-2009 Q fever outbreak in The Netherlands was underestimated when only notified patients according to the European Union case definition are considered.

Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children's Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. This revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with ARTIs. This study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management. "

Using the Pneumoslide IgM test, the presented study explored the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia and investigated further whether there was an association between age or season and aetiological organisms. METHODS: Serum samples, taken between August 2011 and August 2013, from patients with CAP were tested with the Pneumoslide IgM kit. The Pneumoslide IgM technology can simultaneously diagnose 9 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Coxiella burnetii (COX), Chlamydophila pneumonia (CP), Adenovirus (ADV), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A (INFA), Influenza B (INFB), Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs). The data was analyzed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS, version 11.0). RESULTS: Of a total of 1204 serum samples tested, 624 samples were positive. M. pneumoniae was the dominant pathogen, with INFB, PIVs, and RSV ranking second to fourth, respectively. The positive percentages of MP, INFB, PIVs and RSV were found to be associated with age, especially MP, INFB and PIVs. The positive percentages of MP, PIVs and RSV were also found to be associated with season. The positive percentage of MP in autumn was the highest. The positive percentages of LP1 in August and September, ADV in June and INFB in March were relatively higher than that in other months. CONCLUSIONS: The results show there were 4 main viral and atypical bacterial pathogens causing CAP in our study. Some pathogens were found to be associated with age and season. M. pneumoniae was the most predominant pathogen among these 9 pathogens. It is necessary to take preventative measures in order to prevent the spread of these pathogens in susceptible age groups during peak season."

","SPECIES:Coxiella burnetiiID:27276986TITLE:Community-acquired pneumonia related to intracellular pathogens.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide; the annual incidence of CAP among adults in Europe has ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 per 1000 population. Intracellular bacteria are common causes of CAP. However, there is considerable variation in the reported incidence between countries and change over time. The intracellular pathogens that are well established as causes of pneumonia are Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Coxiella burnetii. Since it is known that antibiotic treatment for severe CAP is empiric and includes coverage of typical and atypical pathogens, microbiological diagnosis bears an important relationship to prognosis of pneumonia. Factors such as adequacy of initial antibiotic or early de-escalation of therapy are important variables associated with outcomes, especially in severe cases. Intracellular pathogens sometimes appear to cause more severe disease with respiratory failure and multisystem dysfunction associated with fatal outcomes. The clinical relevance of intracellular pathogens in severe CAP has not been specifically investigated. We review the prevalence, general characteristics, and outcomes of severe CAP cases caused by intracellular pathogens. "

","SPECIES:Coxiella burnetiiID:27317257TITLE:Atypical aetiology in patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia is associated with age, gender and season; a data-analysis on four Dutch cohorts.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be categorised into viral, typical and atypical (Legionella species, Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia species). Extensive microbiological testing to identify the causative microorganism is not standardly recommended, and empiric treatment does not always cover atypical pathogens. In order to optimize epidemiologic knowledge of CAP and to improve empiric antibiotic choice, we investigated whether atypical microorganisms are associated with a particular season or with the patient characteristics age, gender, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A data-analysis was performed on databases from four prospective studies, which all included adult patients hospitalised with CAP in the Netherlands (N = 980). All studies performed extensive microbiological testing. RESULTS: A main causative agent was identified in 565/980 (57.7 %) patients. Of these, 117 (20.7 %) were atypical microorganisms. This percentage was 40.4 % (57/141) during the non-respiratory season (week 20 to week 39, early May to early October), and 67.2 % (41/61) for patients under the age of 60 during this season. Factors that were associated with atypical causative agents were: CAP acquired in the non-respiratory season (odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95 % CI 2.68-6.84), age &lt;60 year (OR 2.9, 95 % CI 1.83-4.66), male gender (OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.06-2.71) and absence of COPD (OR 0.2, 95 % CI 0.12-0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical causative agents in CAP are associated with respectively non-respiratory season, age &lt;60 years, male gender and absence of COPD. Therefore, to maximise its yield, extensive microbiological testing should be considered in patients &lt;60 years old who are admitted with CAP from early May to early October.

METHODS: A prospective multicentre study was performed with 4304 patients. We compared microbiological results, bacterial aetiology, smoking, alcohol abuse and comorbidities in three age groups: young adults (&lt;45 years), adults (45-64 years) and seniors (&gt;65 years). RESULTS: Bacterial aetiology was identified in 1522 (35.4%) patients. In seniors, liver disease was independently associated with Gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae), COPD with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR = 2.69 (1.46-4.97)) and Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 2.8 (1.24-6.3)) and neurological diseases with S. aureus. In adults, diabetes mellitus (DM) was a risk factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus, and COPD for H. influenzae (OR = 3.39 (1.06-10.83)). In young adults, DM was associated with S. aureus. Smoking was a risk factor for Legionella pneumophila regardless of age. Alcohol intake was associated with mixed aetiology and Coxiella burnetii in seniors, and with S. pneumoniae in young adults. CONCLUSION: It should be considered that the bacterial aetiology may differ according to the patient's age, comorbidities, smoking and alcohol abuse. More extensive microbiological testing is warranted in those with risk factors for infrequent microorganisms."

Coxiella burnetii infection was diagnosed by serology in eight of the 29 workers of the company; seven of them had fever or flu-like signs and five had pneumonia, one requiring hospitalisation. A further case of C. burnetii pneumonia was diagnosed in a local resident. Real-time PCR (RTi-PCR) showed a widespread distribution of C. burnetii DNA in dust samples collected from the plant facilities, thus confirming the exposure of workers to the infection inside the factory. Epidemiological investigations identified a goat flock with high C. burnetii seroprevalence and active shedding which was owned and managed by one of the workers of the company as possible source of infection. Genotyping by multispacer sequence typing (MST) and a 10-loci single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discrimination using RTi-PCR identified the same genotype (MST18 and SNP type 8, respectively) in the farm and the factory. These results confirmed the link between the goat farm and the outbreak and allowed the identification of the source of infection.

Despite effective antiretroviral therapy, bacterial pneumonia (the most frequently occurring HIV-associated pulmonary illness) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the HIV-infected population. Over the last few decades, studies have looked at the role of atypical bacterial pneumonia (i.e. pneumonia that causes an atypical clinical presentation or responds differently to typical therapeutics) in association with HIV infection. Due to the lack of available diagnostic strategies, the lack of consideration, and the declining immunity of the patient, HIV co-infections with atypical bacteria are currently believed to be underreported. Thus, following an extensive database search, this review aimed to highlight the current knowledge and gaps regarding atypical bacterial pneumonia in HIV. The authors discuss the prevalence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Legionella species and others in the HIV-infected population as well as their clinical presentation, methods of detection, and treatment. Further studies looking at the role of these microbes in association with HIV are required. Increased knowledge of these atypical bacteria will lead to a more rapid diagnosis of these infections, resulting in an improved quality of life for the HIV-infected population."

A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify Q fever risk factors. Confirmed acute Q fever case was defined as positive serology (IgM &gt;= 50 and phase II IgG &gt;= 200) and/or positive qPCR on serum or blood. In addition, wild mammals were captured at the study site and tested by serology and real-time PCR performed on blood, vaginal swabs and ticks. The attack rate was 20 percent (11/54). All the cases were symptomatic with fever &gt;38.5  C and community-acquired pneumonia for four cases. Log binomial multivariate models identified two independent risk factors associated with Q fever: to clean the house (RRa = 7.5 CI95% [1.03-55.3]) and to carry a three-toed sloth in arms (RRa = 2.6 CI95% [1.1-5.8]). Eighteen marsupial individuals were captured, all PCRs were negative but 17% (3/18) had a positive serology. Another study conducted after the epidemic found only one (1/4) three-tooth sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) with feces highly infectious for C. burnetii MST17. The same strain C. burnetii genotype 17 has been laboratory- confirmed in this mammal and in human cases. These results support the implication of three-toed-sloth in this epidemic. Human contamination mainly occurs through inhalation of infectious aerosols as suggested by high relative risk associated with house cleaning activities and pulmonary forms of the disease, and through direct contact with three- toed-sloth. Positive serological results among marsupials confirm wildlife exposure and suggest a more complex sylvatic transmission cycle among wild mammals."

C. burnetii is also frequently found in bulk tank milk from dairy cows. We evaluated the false positivity rate of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for C. burnetii DNA on throat swabs and investigated whether recent consumption of C. burnetii DNA-positive cow milk could contribute to this phenomenon. METHODS: C. burnetii PCR was performed on throat swabs obtained from patients in whom a throat swab was ordered for other diagnostic purposes; patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); and healthy volunteers after consumption of commercial C. burnetii-containing cow milk products. RESULTS: C. burnetii DNA was found in 5.0% of throat swabs ordered for other diagnostic purposes and in 15.3% of throat swabs from CAP patients without serological evidence of Q fever pneumonia. The positive and negative predictive value of C. burnetii PCR on throat swabs for Q fever pneumonia were 66.7% (95% CI, 38.0-88.2) and 48.9% (95% CI, 41.3-54.6), respectively. After consumption of commercial C. burnetii-containing cow milk products, C. burnetii DNA could be detected in throat swabs for as long as 30 min after ingestion. CONCLUSION: C. burnetii PCR on throat swabs is of low diagnostic value for Q fever pneumonia and was false positive in 15.3% of CAP patients without Q fever pneumonia. Recent consumption of C. burnetii-containing products can influence the outcome of C. burnetii PCR on throat swabs. Therefore, diagnosis of C. burnetii infection should be made in combination with serology or PCR performed on blood."

The aim of this study was to reveal the reservoirs, sources and routes of infection relevant for the Q fever outbreak that occurred in the border region between Serbia and Montenegro. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was conducted from 3rd to 23rd March, 2016 in Brodarevo, village near the Serbian-Montenegro border. The EU case definition for Q fever was applied and serological evidence of IgM and/or IgG antibody for phase II antigen Coxiella burnetii used for laboratory confirmation. Animal infection was proven by detection of specific biomarkers for Q fever by ELISA and Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: In total, ten patients were registered with Q fever, giving an attack rate of 0.5% in the village. A severe form of disease with atypical pneumonia ended up with hospitalization of eight patients. Serological surveillance was conducted in 30 herds of the receptive animals in the outbreak area. Overall the anti-Coxiella antibody seroprevalence was 20.6%. Positive molecular findings (68.4%) accompanied with high seroprevalence (63.2%) were identified in a mini-farm of sheep and cattle in the nearby Orasac, these were considered to be active sources of infection. The most probable route of C. burnetii transmission was the inhalation of contaminated aerosols originating from infected animals. CONCLUSION: The main reservoirs for human Q fever at the border region between Serbia and Montenegro are infected cattle and ruminants. Adoption of a comprehensive strategy for disease prevention and control at the intergovernmental level is urgent."

Human infection primarily occurs following the inhalation of aerosols containing C. burnetii. The infection can either present in an acute or chronic form. The three main presentations are flu-like syndrome, atypical pneumonia, and hepatitis. Chronic Q fever mainly affects the heart where the disease manifests as endocarditis. In this case report, the patient was born at term with congenital heart defects, namely double outlet right ventricle (DORV), ventricular septal defects (VSD), and coarctation of the aorta. He underwent coarctation repair and pulmonary artery binding. At the age of three years, he presented with palpitation, sudden high-grade fever, myalgia, and dyspnea. Endocarditis was suspected due to a history of a surgical repair of congenital heart defects. Blood cultures were negative, however, a diagnosis of Q fever endocarditis was confirmed based on serologic titers. Q fever endocarditis is a challenging diagnosis since the echocardiography findings are often nonspecific. Moreover, Q fever can present as negative-culture endocarditis with low sensitivity of blood and tissue polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for C. burnetii. Hence, the modified Duke criteria has considered phase 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers of 1:800 or more as diagnostic for infective endocarditis. Although uncommon, physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for Q fever endocarditis, especially among patients with pre-existing structural heart disease and associated symptoms and risk factors such as animal exposure."

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out with samples from 685 adults who were admitted with CAP and 108 non-CAP control patients. Atypical pathogens and respiratory viruses in serum were detected using the Pneumoslide IgM test from Vircell, Spain. All patients were divided into 6 groups according to age: 18-24, 25-44, 45-59, 60-74, 75-89, and >90. RESULTS: The total positive rate of CAP was 35.4%, which was highest in the 18-24 age group (P < .05). The highest positive rate, 17.11%, was observed for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The mean age of MP-infected patients was higher than that of the controls (P < .05).

We performed a prospective multicenter study with the aim of assessing the clinical characteristics, etiology, and outcome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with CAP. Between October 1992 and December 1994 we studied 124 COPD patients (mean FEV1 40 +/- 11% of predicted, mean FVC/FEV1 49 +/- 10) admitted because of CAP to one of the participating centers. An attempt to obtain an etiologic diagnosis was performed by means of blood cultures (n = 123), sputum cultures (n = 97), pleural fluid cultures (n = 17), protected specimen brush samples (n = 41), percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration (n = 41), and serology (n = 106). Etiologic diagnosis was achieved in 80 (64%) of cases, however, diagnosis based upon valid techniques was only possible in 73 (59%) cases. The main causal microorganisms were the following: Streptococcus pneumoniae in 32 (43%), Chlamydia pneumoniae in 9 (12%), Hemophilus influenzae in 7 (9%), Legionella pneumophila in 7 (9%), Streptococcus viridans in 3 (4%), Coxiella burnetii in 3 (4%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2 (3%), Nocordia asteroides 2, Aspergillus ssp. 1, and others 10.

The 18 patients described in this paper (5 women and 13 men) complained of sudden onset of fever up to over 40 degrees C, often associated with severe headache and dry cough. Almost all of these patients had previously been healthy and active and of young to middle age (average 38 years) without any bronchopulmonary anamnesis. Radiology revealed that all the patients had in most cases defined pulmonary infiltrates without any specific preference for a particular site. Serology was initially negative, but four weeks later the complement fixation reaction titre was positive for Coxiella burnetii antibodies in 14 patients (78%). All patients became symptom-free within a few days'time when treated with a combination of antibiotics which included doxycycline, whereas the infiltrates receded completely only after several weeks. The occurrence of pulmonary Q-fever in a large northern German conurbation had been rare at that time. Such epidemics, however, were also noted in Berlin (1992) and in Dortmund (1993). The epidemic reported in this article probably originated from one of the frequent flocks of sheep grazing along the banks of the Rhine river near Dusseldorf. The infections were probably acquired by inhalation of airborne organisms in infected aerosols derived from infected sheep, promoted by the long-term very hot and dry weather which was at the same time very windy, leading to an unusually extensive spreading of the pathogens throughout a very large infected aerosol area."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in emergency room and outpatient facilities of Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in offices of participating family doctors based in Halifax. One hundred forty-nine adults with acute onset of one or more symptoms or signs suggestive of pneumonia and radiographic evidence of pneumonia who provided informed consent were enrolled. Patients known to be HIV positive or who had been discharged from a hospital within the previous 10 days were ineligible for enrollment. Demographic features and clinical data were collected by direct patient interview and chart review by trained research nurses. Outcome measures included quantitative evaluation of pneumonia-specific symptoms, and responses to the Short Form 36 Health Survey at presentation and at 30 days after presentation. Information was also collected on each patient's health prior to pneumonia, as well as the time until each patient's self-reported return to work and to usual activities. The etiology of pneumonia was determined by testing acute and convalescent serum samples for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, adenovirus, respiratory syncytia virus, influenza viruses A and B, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 149 patients, 54 (36%) of whom were men, with a mean age (+/- SD) of 41 +/- 15 years. An etiological diagnosis was made in 74 (49.7%) patients using serological methods. Etiological agents included M pneumoniae 34 (22.8%); C pneumoniae 16 (10.7%); M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae 5 (3.4%); C burnetii 4 (2.7%); influenza A virus 4 (2.7%); and other agents 6% (7.4%). Three patients (2%) had a conventional bacterial etiology, and 72 patients (48.3%) had pneumonia of undetermined etiology. Patients with pneumonia of known (atypical) and undetermined etiology were similar in terms of age, gender, race, education, employment, and comorbidity. Despite a higher proportion of patients with pneumonia of known etiology reporting sweats, chills, and headache at presentation, the two groups were similar for symptom severity and bother. The patients with pneumonia of undetermined etiology were more likely to have multilobar pneumonia (P &lt; 0.02). Both patients with atypical pneumonia and those with pneumonia of undetermined etiology suffered severe deterioration of physical functioning with a marked but incomplete recovery at 30 days. Those with atypical pneumonia had higher physical functioning and general mental health scores at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half the cases of ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia are due to ""atypical"" agents. It is not possible to reliably distinguish patients with atypical pneumonia from those with pneumonia of undetermined etiology by clinical features at baseline.

METHOD: Descriptive and retrospective study. One hundred fifty-five pair of sera of 129 patients adults and 26 patients with less of 15 years with pneumonia were analysed. Antibody against respiratory virus, Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia sp. and S. pneumoniae were investigated. RESULTS: The serology diagnosis was obtained in 58 patients (37.4%) (42 [32.6%] adults and 16 [61.5%] children; p = 0.006). The pneumonia most frequently detected was caused by M. pneumoniae (21 cases; 13.5%), followed by Chlamydia spp. (13, 8.4%), S. pneumoniae (8, 5.2%) and mixed infection in other 7 cases. Detection of antibodies against pneumococcus and Chlamydia sp. improved as a whole in 8.4% (from 29% to 37.4%), a 10.9% (from 22.5 to 32.6%) in adults and none case in children. Moreover, a major proportion of mixed infection and by syncytial respiratory virus in children (19.5 and 11.5%, respectively) versus adults (1.6 and 0%, respectively; p &lt; 0.1) was observed. CONCLUSION: With the detection of antibodies against Chlamydia spp. by indirect immunofluorescence and capsular polysaccharide pneumococcal by enzyme-immunoanalysis increased the etiologic diagnosis of the community pneumonia."

Reliability of the criteria for deciding ambulatory treatment].ABSTRACT:To determine whether criteria for not admitting community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients diagnosed in the emergency room are appropriate, and to characterize the symptoms, etiology and course of CAP. This one-year prospective, protocol study of immunocompetent CAP patients diagnosed in the emergency room of our hospital enrolled patients not considered to require hospital admission according to the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Respiratory Disease (SEPAR). Medical histories, chest X-rays and blood analysis were obtained for all patients. Blood cultures were analyzed for antibodies against Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci and influenza virus types A and B. The patients received erythromycin for 14 days and were regularly checked by the pulmonologist in the outpatient clinic until signs and symptoms had disappeared. One hundred six patients were enrolled. Mean age was 36 +/- 13 years. Only 3 patients had to be admitted to hospital, after which outcome was good. The main symptoms were fever (106, 100%) and cough (83, 78%). In 46 (43.4%) chest sounds were normal. Microbiologic diagnoses were achieved for 28 (26.4%) and Coxiella burnetii was the agent most often found (19, 17.9%). Outcome was good in all cases, with faster disappearance of symptoms than of radiological signs. The SEPAR criteria for admitting patients with CAP are appropriate. The clinical symptoms of such patients are non specific, a noteworthy finding being that many patients had normal chest sounds. Coxiella burnetii was the most common causative agent. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were excellent."

This bacterium can replicate only within cells, yet it is capable of surviving in the environment because it can withstand drying and substantial temperature variations. Livestock, especially sheep, goats and cattle, are a major reservoir of C burnetii. The organism is transmitted to humans by direct contact with animal products, especially during parturition. Aerosols have transmitted infection over considerable distances. The illness is characterized by an influenza-like syndrome with patchy pulmonary infiltrates. The pneumonia may be accompanied by biochemical evidence of mild hepatitis. The diagnosis is established serologically. Tetracycline or doxycycline provide effective therapy."

METHOD: A prospective 1 year study of all patients hospitalized with CAP in the Negev region of Israel. The aetiology was determined by blood and pleural fluid cultures, and specific serological testing for pathogenic agents. Eighty-nine percent of the patients underwent follow-up for a month after discharge. RESULTS: The study included 346 patients (53% males, mean age 49.3 +/- 19.5, range 17-94). A single aetiologic agent was identified in 146 patients (42.2%), multiple agents were found in 133 (38.4%), and no agent was identified in 67 (19.4%). Among the common pathogens were Pneumococcus sp. in 148 patients (42.8%). Mycoplasma pneumoniae (101, 29.2%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (62, 17.9%), Legionella sp. (56, 16.2%), viruses (35, 10.1%), Coxiella burnetti (20, 5.8%). Haemophilus influenzae (19, 5.5%), and other bacteria (21, 6.1%). Approximately 70% of the patients infected with M. pneumoniae and C. burnetti were younger than 45 years (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, about 50% of the patients with C. pneumoniae (TWAR) were over the age of 65 (P = 0.03). The presence of comorbidity was associated with a greater frequency of bacterial aetiologies (57% vs. 44%, P = 0.02), and fewer infections with M. pneumoniae (15% vs. 36%, P = 0.0004), or C. burnetii (2% vs. 8%, P = 0.02). Specific causative agents were associated with specific seasons: viruses between December and April (P = 0.03), and Legionella sp. from July to October (P = 0.003). In contrast, no seasonal variation was associated with pneumococcus, M. pneumoniae, or C. pneumoniae (TWAR). CONCLUSIONS: Patients are hospitalized with CAP throughout the year. Since the pathogen is usually unknown at hospitalization, epidemiological data is important for choosing medication. The findings of this study point to the importance of macrolides alone or in combination with cephalosporins, as the treatment of choice for patients in our region."

Although a great variety of microorganisms are able to cause community-acquired pneumonia only a few pathogens play an important role in daily practice. The most important investigations are blood cultures and sputum cultures to detect bacteria like pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus as well as antibody tests for Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia. According to anamnesis and clinic presentation tests such as for Legionella or viruses have to be added. Sometimes also rare pathogens have to be considered such as Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira, Hantaviruses, cryptococci or Chlamydia psittaci. The standard procedure for diagnosis of tuberculosis is the microscopical examination and the standardized culture in liquid and on solid media. Amplification methods such as PCR are also useful for a rapid diagnosis. However, the application of amplification procedures alone without culture is not recommended."

Measurements of ADA were also carried out in 35 healthy subjects (mean age 52 years). The serum ADA activity in patients with typical bacterial pneumonia (TBP) was 21 +/- 7 IU/l and in controls 22 +/- 9 IU/l. In 43 patients with atypical pneumonia (AP), ADA levels (43 +/- 23 IU/l) were significantly higher than in the previously related groups (p &lt; 0.001). Analysis within the group of atypical pneumonia showed significant differences for infections caused by Coxiella burnetii (61 +/- 19 IU/l, p &lt; 0.001), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (44 +/- 26 IU/l, p &lt; 0.001) and Legionella pneumophila (39 +/- 15 IU/l, p &lt; 0.05), as compared with patients with bacterial pneumonia and normal control subjects.

The present study characterizes those cases in which Streptococcus pneumoniae was the only pathogen and those in which additional etiological agents were identified. Pneumococcal CAP was diagnosed by standard blood cultures or positive serological tests by one of two laboratory methods. In 100 (67.6%) patients, at least one other etiological agent of CAP was identified in addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Compared with patients who were not infected by Streptococcus pneumoniae, patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae CAP were older and had a higher rate of comorbidity (39.5% vs. 29.8%). Streptococcus pneumoniae CAP had a more severe clinical course and a higher mortality rate, especially when Streptococcus pneumoniae was the only pathogen. Community-acquired pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae only was more similar in its clinical manifestations to classic typical pneumococcal pneumonia. When an additional etiological agent was identified, the clinical characteristics could not be distinguished from those of atypical pneumonia. It is concluded that Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the principal cause of CAP in this region. The frequency of additional etiological agents of CAP and the difficulty in differentiating clinically between cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae only and those due to Streptococcus pneumoniae plus other organisms necessitates initial empirical treatment that covers Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other causative agents of atypical pneumonia."

The objectives were: to determine the cases managed in the ambulatory setting; to describe the clinical features; to identify the aetiological agents, and to describe the treatment, comparing inpatients with outpatients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Observational prospective study. Population attended at three teaching primary care centers of Palma de Mallorca (60,450 habitants). Patients (&gt; 14 years) were investigated when diagnosticated of community-acquired pneumoniae, from November 1992 to December 1994. Exclussions: HIV infection, patients living in a nursing home and tuberculosis. Data were collected in both Hospital and primary health care centers. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings were recorded at the initial visit and 21 days after. RESULTS: 91 cases were investigated. 57% were managed at the primary care centers exclusively, 63.3% of the patients who went initially to the hospital were admitted in; but only 10.9% of those who went initially to the primary care centers (p &lt; 0.005). 24 patients were hospitalized. 56 microbiological agents were identified in 48 patients (52.7%): Mycoplasma pneumoniae (10); Streptococcus pneumoniae (9); Influenza B (8); Chlamydia psittacci (7); Influenza A (7); Coxiella burnetii (5); Chlamydia pneumoniae (4); Legionella (3); Adenovirus (2); and Parainfluenza 3 (1). Mycoplasma was predominant in outpatients: 9 cases. S. pneumoniae in inpatients: 5 cases. Eritromycin was the most common treatment prescribed (76.9% of patients), alone or in combination with other antibiotics. Monotherapy was most common at primary care yield (96.7%) than at the hospital (45.2%) (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients with community-acquired pneumonias are managed at primary health care centers.

Three hundred ninety-two patients with CAP were studied prospectively in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare epidemiologic and demographic data and clinical, analytical, and radiologic features of presentation in 48 patients with CAP by LP and 125 patients with CAP by other bacterial etiology (68 by Streptococcus pneumoniae, 41 by Chlamydia pneumoniae, 5 by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4 by Coxiella burnetii, 3 by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 by Haemophilus influenzae, and 2 by Nocardia species. Univariate analysis showed that CAP by LP was more frequent in middle-aged, male healthy (but alcohol drinking) patients than CAP by other etiology. Moreover, the lack of response to previous beta-lactamic drugs, headache, diarrhea, severe hyponatremia, and elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels on presentation were more frequent in CAP by LP, while cough, expectoration, and thoracic pain were more frequent in CAP by other bacterial etiology. However, multivariate analysis only confirmed these differences with respect to lack of underlying disease, diarrhea, and elevation in the CK level. We conclude that detailed analysis of features of presentation of CAP allows suspicion of Legionnaire's disease in the emergency department. The initiation of antibiotic treatment, including a macrolide, and the performance of rapid diagnostic techniques are mandatory in these cases."

Methods: A total of 8 pediatric patients (4 males, 4 females) with PTE diagnosed in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from March, 2014 to March, 2019 were enrolled. The clinical manifestation, laboratory results, imaging findings, diagnosis and treatment were summarized. Results: Among these 8 cases, aged from 9 hours to 14 years and 10 months. Fever was found in 4 cases, cough aggravation in 4, short of breath in 3, chest pain in 2, abdominal and back pain in one, hemoptysis in 2, cyanosis in 1, and edema of lower extremities in 2. Physical examination found decreased breath sound in 2 cases, phlegm rale in 3, and pleural friction rub in one. Pleural effusion was found in 5 cases by ultrasound. Plasma D-dimer increased in 6 cases (0.66-9.96 mg/L) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein elevated in 5 cases (10.78-78.00 mg/L). Chest enhanced CT showed pulmonary artery or venous filling defects, including pulmonary artery embolism in 7 cases and pulmonary vein embolism in one. The primary disease of these patients included Mycoplasma Pneumoniae pneumonia in 4 cases, nephritis in 2 and postoperative congenital heart disease in 2. Apart from one case who withdrew the treatment and was discharged, the other 7 patients received anticoagulant treatment had good outcome. Conclusions: For children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, immune disorders, long-term hormone therapy, cardiovascular invasive operation or other high-risk factors, PTE should be considered when fever, cough aggravation, short of breath, chest and back pain with pleural effusion are present. Chest enhanced CT scan should be performed as soon as possible, and anticoagulation should be started once the diagnosis is confirmed."

However, the lack of diagnostic criteria for quantitative ELISA M. pneumoniae-IgG (MP-IgG) and the low positive rates of ELISA M. pneumoniae-IgM (MP-IgM) limit the diagnostic value of ELISA for M. pneumoniae infection in adults. Here, the diagnostic value of quantitative ELISA MP-IgG was evaluated in adults with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP). The serum M. pneumoniae antibodies were detected in 162 patients with MPP, 228 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with non-Mycoplasma pneumoniae (NMP), and 162 healthy controls by ELISA, using the PA results as the reference standards. For the MP-IgM-/IgG+ subgroup, a single serum MP-IgG level of >=92.67 RU/mL can be used as a reference criterion for the diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection. At admission, for patients with CAP, the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA MP-IgM positivity for MPP were 18.51% and 99.56%, respectively. MP-IgM positivity combined with MP-IgG >= 92.67 RU/mL increased the sensitivity to 40.12% and decreased the specificity to 94.29%. For paired serum samples obtained within seven days, an ELISA MP-IgG concentration change of >=1.48-fold and MP-IgG >= 92.67 RU/mL on day 7 were used as the diagnostic criteria for M. pneumoniae infection. Accordingly, the combination of qualitative MP-IgM detection and quantitative MP-IgG detection by ELISA is valuable for acute MPP diagnosis in adults."

The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and long-term prognosis of MPP-associated thrombosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 43 children with MPP-associated thrombosis between January 2013 and June 2019 at Beijing Children's Hospital. The results of blood coagulation studies, autoimmune antibody, thrombophilia screening, contrast-enhanced lung computed tomography, echocardiography, and blood vessel ultrasonography were analyzed, as were treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were diagnosed with SMPP. D-dimer was higher than 5.0 mg/L in 58.1% (25/43) of patients. The mean D-dimer level was 11.1 +- 12.4 mg/L. Anticardiolipin-IgM was positive in 60.0% of patients, beta2-glycoprotein-IgM in 64.0%, and lupus anticoagulant in 42.1%. Chest imaging revealed pulmonary consolidation with lobe distribution in all patients (2/3-1 lobe in 10 patients, > 1 lobe in 29 patients). In our experience, thrombosis can occur in a vessel of any part of the body, and it can be initially detected as late as 31 days after disease onset. Thrombosis in the brain and abdomen can occur early, at 5 days after disease onset. Pulmonary vessels were the most commonly involved sites in the current study, and accordingly chest pain was the most common symptom (32.6%), followed by neurological symptoms (14.0%) and abdominal pain (9.3%). Thirty-five percent of patients were asymptomatic with regard to thrombosis. All patients underwent anticoagulant therapy, and thrombus absorption took > 3 months in most patients. All patients were followed until October 2019, at which time 41 were asymptomatic and 2 had mild recurrent cough. CONCLUSIONS: SMPP with pulmonary consolidation (> 2/3 lobe) was the most strongly associated risk factor for thrombosis. Thrombosis-associated symptoms may be subtle, even absent. Elevated D-dimer, specifically > 11.1 mg/L (even > 5.0 mg/L), would assist in the early diagnosis of thrombosis. The long-term prognosis of thrombosis was good after timely administration of anticoagulant therapy."

An early and rapid diagnostic method is key for guiding clinicians in their choice of antibiotics. METHODS: The recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay is a recently developed, rapid detection method that has been used for the detection of several pathogens. The assays were performed in a one-step single tube reaction at 39  Celsius within 15-30 min. In this study, we established an RAA assay for M. pneumoniae using clinical specimens for validation and commercial real-time PCR as the reference method. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity of the RAA assay was 2.23 copies per reaction, and no cross-reactions with any of the other 15 related respiratory bacterial pathogens were observed. Compared with the commercial real-time PCR assay used when testing 311 respiratory specimens, the RAA assay obtained 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a kappa value of 1. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the proposed RAA assay will be of benefit as a faster, sensitive, and specific alternative tool for the detection of M. pneumoniae."

METHODS: A total of 73 children with RMPP and 146 children with general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were included. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were obtained. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to determine optimal predictors. The nomogram was plotted by multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. RESULTS: The LASSO regression analysis identified lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, neutrophil ratio, and high fever as significant predictors of RMPP. This nomogram-illustrated model showed good discrimination, calibration, and clinical value. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.884 (95% CI, 0.823-0.945) in the training set and 0.881 (95% CI, 0.807-0.955) in the validating set.

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0-18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children &lt; 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2-18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health."

This association has shifted to be related to flooding events and outdoor activities; few cases are related to high-risk factors found in immunosuppressed patients. Scarcely a handful of cases have serological evidence of immune response against Leptospira serovar Bratislava representing serogroup Australis, a serovar associated with poor reproductive performance in swine and horses, and recently with cats. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we describe a rare clinical presentation of disseminated Leptospira infection in an immunosuppressed 65-year-old woman. She was admitted to the emergency room with fever, bacteraemia, bilateral uveitis and pulmonary involvement. The patient denied outdoor activities; she only had wide exposure to faeces and urine from cats living in her home. Her medical history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed at the age of 18. She did not respond to medical treatment, and a splenectomy was performed. At age 60, she was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), and was treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) -Imatinib. The patient voluntarily discontinued the treatment for the last 6 months. After extensive workup, no microorganisms were identified by the commonly used stains in microbiology. The diagnosis was performed through dark-field microscopy, microagglutination test (MAT), Leptospira genus-specific PCR, the IS1500 PCR for identification of pathogenic species, and 16S based sequencing for the genus identification. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressed patients may acquire uncommon infections from ubiquitous microorganisms. In this case, serology evidence of exposure to Leptospira serovar Bratislava by MAT and the presence of the Leptospira genus were identified. It should be on mind for the diagnosis in otherwise healthy patients, and thoroughly search on splenectomised patients exposed to animals. Additionally, this report highlights the usefulness of PCR for diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening illness."

The pathogens of the disease may change for the misuse of antibiotics and the application of vaccines. Therefore, pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics may have changed. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics. METHOD: The current study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pathogens positive in children with S/L-PP under 14 years old at a single hospital between 1st Jan 2014 and 31st Dec 2018 retrospectively. The pathogens were detected by microbial cultivation, indirect immunofluorescence of the kit (PNEUMOSLIDE IgM), Elisa, and/or real-time PCR in the samples of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 593 children with S/L-PP received treatment at a single hospital during the study period by inclusion criteria. Four hundred fifty-one patients were single positive for one pathogen and 83 patients were positive for at least 2 pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) (72.34%) was the most commonly detected pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae) (8.77%). The prevalence of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time (p < 0.05). The positive rate of M.pneumoniae increased with ages of patients (p < 0.05). M.pneumoniae was statistically associated with the extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was statistically associated with abnormal white blood cells (WBCs) and C reactive proteins (CRPs) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M.pneumoniae was the most positive pathogen in children with S/L-PP. The positive rate of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time and the ages of children. M.pneumoniae was associated with extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was associated with abnormal WBCs and CRPs."

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with serologically-confirmed MPP or culture-confirmed other bacterial pneumonia (OBP). The distribution of affected areas, abnormalities in lateral bronchial lesions, the degree of air bronchogram, and previously reported findings on HRCT were evaluated for MPP and OBP. Predictive HRCT findings for MPP were determined by logistic regression analysis. We provisionally designed our HRCT criteria (negative, probable, or highly suspected) for diagnosing MPP and investigated the diagnostic yield of the HRCT criteria. RESULTS: Sixty-three MPP and 126 OBP patients were included in this study. Logistic regression analysis showed that the absence of peripheral predominance, bronchial wall thickening, lateral bronchial wall thickening, intralobular or lobular ground-glass opacities, intralobular ground-glass opacities connected to a lateral bronchus, and less air bronchogram in infiltrates were significant predictors of MPP. Our HRCT criteria showed that the sensitivity and specificity in negative, probable, and highly suspected MPP were 0.0 and 0.33, 1.0 and 0.69, and 0.5 and 0.98, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HRCT had considerable ability to detect a lateral bronchial abnormality and to diagnose or rule out MPP based on the distribution of affected areas, abnormalities in lateral bronchial lesions, and the degree of air bronchogram in the infiltrates."

Bacterial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional methods. This study assessed the clinical factors influencing bacterial mPCR results in patients with COP. Patients with COP admitted to a tertiary care hospital between November 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively assessed. Conventional methods included culture-based methods and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial mPCR that could identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia was performed. Bacterial mPCR was performed in a total of 342 patients with COP in the study. Bacterial mPCR alone provided etiology in 99 patients. The total etiologic diagnosis rates improved from 22.2 to 51.1% when bacterial mPCR was added to conventional methods. Additional diagnostic benefits of bacterial mPCR were more prominent in the prior antibiotic non-exposure group (77.8% vs 63.5%, P = 0.015) and in the low-risk group with low CURB 65 score (62.6% vs 44.9%, P = 0.005). Patients who required ICU care, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and patients with any underlying diseases were not associated with the additional pathogen detection rates using bacterial mPCR. By supplementing conventional diagnostic methods with bacterial mPCR-based methods, the overall pathogen detection rates improved in patients with COP. Moreover, the additional diagnostic usefulness of bacterial mPCR was significantly higher in patients without prior antibiotic exposure and in the mild-to-moderate-risk group with lower CURB 65 score."

OBJECTIVES: We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK. METHODS: Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female. Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19. Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate. Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention. This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients. Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops."

However, little is known about the impacts of air pollutants on pediatric admissions for Mycoplasma pneumonia. This study was conducted to investigate the impacts of air pollutants on pediatric hospital admissions for Mycoplasma pneumonia in Shanghai, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was applied to explore the association between pediatric hospital admissions and levels of air pollutants (fine particulate matter, particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide). Data on hospital admissions for pneumonia and levels of ambient air pollutants were obtained for the period of 2015 to 2018. Associations between pediatric admissions for Mycoplasma pneumonia and ambient air pollutants were calculated using logistic regression and described by the odds ratio and relevant 95% confidence interval. The hysteresis effects of air pollutants from the day of hospital admission to the previous 7 days were evaluated in single-pollutant models and multi-pollutant models with adjustments for weather variables and seasonality. Lag 0 was defined as the day of hospital admission, lag 1 was defined as the day before hospital admission, and so forth. RESULTS: In the single-pollutant models (without adjustment for other pollutants), pediatric hospital admissions for pneumonia were positively associated with elevated concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter. A 0.5% increase in daily admissions per 10-mug/m3 increase in the nitrogen dioxide level occurred at lag 1 and lag 2, and a 0.3% increase in daily admissions per 10-mug/m3 increase in fine particulate matter occurred at lag 1. In the multi-pollutant models, nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter remained significant after inclusion of particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated that higher levels of nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter increase the risk of pediatric hospitalization for Mycoplasma pneumonia in Shanghai, China. These findings imply that the high incidence of Mycoplasma pneumonia in children in Asia might be attributed to the high concentration of specific air pollutants in Asia."

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of viral and intracellular respiratory pathogens in children with SCD presenting with fever and/or ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, prospective, single-centre cohort study with nested case-control analysis was conducted on children with SCD admitted from October 2016 to October 2017 for fever and/or ACS to the paediatric department of Robert Debre university hospital, Paris, France. They were screened for 20 respiratory pathogens by a multiplex PCR in the nasopharynx (FilmArray). RESULTS: We included 101 children. M/F sex ratio of 0.45. The median age was 3.2 years (IQR: 1.4-8.2). At least one pathogen was isolated in 67 patients (67%). The most frequent viruses were as follows: rhinovirus (n=33), adenovirus (n=14), respiratory syncytial virus (n=13) and parainfluenza viruses (n=11). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in one case. Twenty-three (23%) presented with or developed ACS. A nested case-control analysis was performed, after pairing ACS with non-ACS children for age and inclusion period. There was no statistical association between any viral detection or multiple viral infection, and ACS (p=0.51) even though parainfluenza viruses were twice as common in ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Viral detection in febrile children with SCD is frequent, but its association with ACS was not demonstrated. In this study, M. pneumoniae was rare in young children with SCD experiencing ACS."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission revealed lesions of the corpus callosum and brain white matter. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer) on day 7 shows hypoperfusion (with right dominance) of bilateral upper parietal region. His condition improved gradually with symptomatic treatments alone, and he was discharged on day 13. The lesions on the MRI disappeared by day 15. Although this case might have suffered from leukoencephalopathy, clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) type II was suspected from the reversible splenial lesion. Except for the elevation (640 times) of mycoplasma pneumonia antibody titer (particle agglutination) in the serum, the blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid findings showed no significant abnormalities. We then considered this encephalopathy was related to mycoplasma pneumonia infection. Since no symptoms of mycoplasma infection except for neurologic symptoms were observed, indirect mechanism, such as immune-mediated reactions, is suggested to cause encephalopathy in this case."

Although single MP infection is common enough, MP and EBV coinfection have received little attention. Especially, the pathogenic role of EBV in lung when coinfection with MP, has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of EBV on MP pneumonia (MPP) in hospitalized children. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of MPP children who underwent screening for EBV by polymerase chain reaction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during hospitalization in 2014. Of total 147 patients, 68 patients were in the MP group and 79 were in the MP/EBV coinfection group. We found longer fever duration and higher CRP, IgA, IgG, interleukin-2 (IL-2), percentage of peripheral neutrophils levels, higher incidence of pulmonary consolidation and percentage of refractory MPP in coinfection group, when compared to those in MP group. In ROC curve analysis, IL-2 was useful for differentiating patients with coinfection from those with MP infection. Logistic regression analysis showed that the IL-2 >= 3.35 pg/ml (OR = 3.677) was a significant predictor regarding to MP/EBV coinfection. In conclusion, coinfection of EBV and MP poses a higher risk for prolonged symptoms. IL-2 could be used as a good predictor of coinfection."

They were divided into two groups based on MP infection: MP infection group (n = 97) and non-MP infection group (n = 113). We compared the variables of these two groups based on medical records.The MP infection group had higher ESR than the non-MP infection group. During hospitalization, the non-MP infection group had higher levels of WBC during hospital, LDH, PCT, and lower HB when compared to the MP infection group. No differences were found in the hs-CRP level, N%, PLT, ALT, CKMB, and cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) between MP and non-MP infection group. Likewise, no difference was found in fever duration or hospital stays between them. Totally 19 patients in the infection group had CAA with a rate of 19.59%; and 27 (23.89%) patients had CAA in the non-MP infection group. Unfortunately, no difference was found in CAA rate between the two groups.MP infection may occur simultaneously in children with Kawasaki disease. KD patients with MP infection tended to occur in older population. MP infection may not increase the risk of CAA, which still needs further large-scaled studies to confirm. Clinicians should be alert to KD patients with high level of ESR. MP should be screened and early treatment with macrolides should be given timely."

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples. The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management. The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.

Methods: Four hundred and fifty-four (male 210, female 244) children with pneumonia in Department of Pulmonology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were enrolled from July, 2018 to October, 2018. Pharyngeal swabs and venous blood were obtained on the first or the second day after hospitalization. Fluorescence detection quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA, MP culture and MP-IgM were used to detect MP simultaneously. MP infection is diagnosed if MP culture is positive or the two of the other three methods are positive. Pharyngeal swabs were acquired and detected using fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA and MP culture again for children with confirmed MP infection before discharge. The detection rates and quantitative changes of the three methods were compared, and chi(2) test was used for comparison among groups. Results: A total of 454 hospitalized children with pneumonia were included in this study. The detection rates of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA, MP culture and MP-IgM IgM were 43.6% (198/454), 43.2% (196/454), 40.0% (180/454) and 30.6% (139/454) respectively. The difference of detection rates of the four methods was statistically significant (chi(2)=20.8, P<0.05),but no significant difference between the detection rates of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA and thermostatic amplification of RNA was found (chi(2)=0.018, P=0.900). They both had higher detection rates than MP-IgM or MP culture. MP infection is diagnosed if MP culture is positive or the two of the other three methods are positive, and two hundred and nine children were diagnosed as MP infection. In the second test of MP infection in 209 children before discharge, the positive rate of MP culture was 67.5% (141/209), with 39.4% (13/33) changed from negative to positive, and 27.3% (48/176) changed from positive to negative. The positive rate of thermostatic amplification of RNA was 82.3% (172/209), with 16.2% (31/191) turned from positive to negative, and 66.7% (12/18) turned from negative to positive. The positive rate of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA was 67.0% (140/209), with 52.9% (18/34) cases changed from negative to positive, and 30.3% (53/175) cases changed from positive to negative. MP-DNA load decreased in 141 cases (67.5%) and increased in 68 cases (32.5%) in the second test among the positive samples tested by fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA. The detection rates of the four methods in the non-severe group and the severe group were similar, and the differences among the groups were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). In the second test, the proportion of changing from negative to positive in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group, but only the difference in the thermostatic amplification of RNA was statistically significant (P=0.038) and the cases of changing from negative to positive of thermostatic amplification of RNA in the severe group and non-severe group are 7 and 5 respectively. Conclusions: The methods of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid detection have high sensitivity and application value in the etiological diagnosis of acute MP infection in children. The results of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA and thermostatic amplification of RNA are highly consistent, and they are both more advantageous than MP-IgM. Repeated testing in the acute phase is helpful to find MP infection children whose first test is negative. The load of MP-DNA did not decrease in some children in the acute stage after antibiotic treatment."

Establishing an early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may have important therapeutic implications. METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS in a case series of adults and youth hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort study in two university teaching hospitals, from November 2017 to October 2019. RESULTS: In all 10 patients, early and rapid diagnosis for severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS was achieved with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. The average PaO2/FiO2 of all patients was 180 mmHg. Of the 10 cases, 4 cases had moderate ARDS (100 mmHg <= PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg) and 3 cases had severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was applied in all patients, though only two patients were sufficiently supported with HFNC. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was required in 5 patients. High resistance (median 15 L/cmH2O/s) and low compliance (median 38 ml/cmH2O) was observed in 4 cases. In these 4 cases, recruitment maneuvers (RM) were applied, with 1 patient demonstrating no response to RM. Prone positioning were applied in 4 cases. Two cases needed ECMO support with median support duration of 5.5 days. No patient in our case series received corticosteroid therapy. All patients were survived and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Early and rapid diagnosis of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS can be achieved with PCR/mNGS tests in samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. In our case series, half of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS cases were adequately supported with HFNC or NIV, while half of cases required intubation. RM and prone position were effective in 30% of intubated cases, and 20% needed ECMO support. When early anti-mycoplasmal antibiotics were given together with sufficient respiratory support, the survival rate was high with no need for corticosteroid use."

METHODS: Computer search for PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBMdisc), China Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang, VIP (VIP), and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AZI combined with GC in the treatment of children with refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia test (RCT), the search time limit is built until March 20, 2019. Two researchers independently performed literature screening, data extraction, and literature risk bias, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs were included, including 1130 patients. Meta-analysis showed that AZI combined with GC therapy significantly improved the total effective rate of the disease compared with the conventional treatment group (odds ratio [OR] = 6.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.03, 10.07; P < .00001; I = 0%), effectively shortened the antipyretic time (SMD = -2.29; 95% CI -2.70, -1.88; P < .0001); promoted lung inflammation absorption (SMD = -1.89; 95% CI -2.38, -1.40; P < .0001), reduced cough time (SMD = -2.39; 95% CI -2.80, -1.99; P < .0001); shortened hospital stay (SMD = -2.19; 95% CI -3.21, -1.17; P < .0001); improved imaging findings (OR = 5.38; 95% CI 1.09, 26.51, P = .04); reduced inflammation index (SMD = -3.15; 95% CI -4.93, -1.36; P = .004); improved immune function (SMD = 1.29; 95% CI -0.02, 2.60; P < .0001); had no significant adverse reactions (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.71, 1.98; P = .53).

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in 37 patients with NP caused by MP (NP group) and 74 patients diagnosed with lobar M. pneumoniae pneumonia with no necrosis (control group) who were admitted to our hospital between January 2013 and December 2017. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data, imaging findings, treatments and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of females, the incidence of pleural effusion, fever duration, hospitalization days, white blood cell count, neutrophil ratio, D-dimer level and use of other types of antibiotics were higher in the NP group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The control group exhibited a greater use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) than the NP group (P < 0.05). According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a white blood cell count > 12.3 x 109/L (Odds ratio, OR = 6.412), a neutrophil ratio > 73.9% (OR = 6.081) and D-dimer level > 1367.5 ng/mL (OR = 8.501) were risk factors for pulmonary necrosis caused by MP. Furthermore, the use of LMWH (OR = 0.074) reduced the risk of pulmonary necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: NP is a rare complication of severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (SMPP), and although the clinical course is longer than common MP infection, the necrotic area is absorbed gradually. In patients with SMPP presenting with lobar consolidation, a white blood cell count > 12.3 x 109/L, a neutrophil ratio > 73.9% and D-dimer level > 1367.5 ng/mL are risk factors for pulmonary necrosis, and the use of LMWH reduces the risk of pulmonary necrosis."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma amphoriformebID:32497137TITLE:Clinical diagnostic application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Pneumonia is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children's Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."

The coinfection rate of M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) can reach 52% in some areas, but the effects of coinfection with different pathogens have not been clearly recognized. METHODS: The cases of MPP hospitalized in Beijing Children's Hospital from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2016 were screened. MPP patients coinfected with Human adenovirus (HAdV) were categorized into the research group. Patients with single M. pneumoniae infection were categorized into the control group, matching the research group by age and admission time with a ratio of 1:3. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and disease severity were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 2540 hospitalized MPP cases were screened in Beijing Children's Hospital, among which thirty cases were enrolled in the research group and ninety cases were enrolled in the control group. The results indicated that patients in the research group had longer hospital stays, longer fever durations and a higher rate of dyspnea, as well as a larger proportion applications of oxygen therapy and noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). No obvious differences were found in lab examinations within the two groups. Regarding disease severity, the proportions of extremely severe pneumonia and severe disease defined by the clinical score system were higher in the research group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Compared with single M. pneumoniae infection, MPP coinfected with HAdV in children was relatively more serious."

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of proper selection of antibiotics for treatment of severe MPP and increase awareness concerning the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP. PATIENT CONCERNS: A case of severe life-threatening pneumonia in a 26-year-old man with high fever and cough was non-responsive to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with MPP based on the test results of bronchoalveolar lavage using real-time quantitative PCR method. INTERVENTIONS: Tigecycline was given to the patient after azithromycin and fluoroquinolones failed. OUTCOMES: The patients fever subsided within the first day of tigecycline therapy. He showed rapid symptom resolution and improvement in lung infiltration after 4 days of tigecycline therapy. LESSONS: The case suggests that fulminant MPP should be timely treated with proper antibiotics, and the possible emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP should be of concern."

METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed on 345 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) admitted to our hospital wards from January 2017 to June 2019. They were divided into three groups, namely MPP with hypoxia, refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP), and general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (GMPP). The clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging, and management were collected and compared in the three groups. RESULTS: The MPP with hypoxia patients (n = 69) had longer disease duration, a higher extra-pulmonary complications rate, and more severe radiological abnormalities (P < 0.05). They also needed more complicated treatments (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the levels of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin (IL)-6, ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen (FG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the percentage of neutrophils in the MPP with hypoxia group were significantly higher than those in the RMPP group and the GMPP group (P < 0.05). In ROC curve analysis, the percentage of neutrophils, WBC, CRP, LDH, IL-6, ferritin, D-dimer, and ALT were contributed to identify the MPP with hypoxia patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ferritin> 174.15 ng/mL, IL-6 > 25.475 pg/ml, and pleural effusion were significantly associated with the incidence of hypoxia in MPP (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MPP with hypoxia patients presented more serious clinical manifestations. Ferritin> 174.15 ng/mL, IL-6 > 25.475 pg/ml and pleural effusion were related risk factors for hypoxia in MPP."

This study aimed to systematically review the current situation and public health burden associated with children infected with SARS-CoV2. METHODS: We searched 4 electronic databases without language limitations. The pooled proportion or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each analysis to explore the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and coinfection, as well as to assess the sex of SARS-CoV-2-infected children. RESULTS: We obtained data from 14 eligible studies with 410 patients for the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection was 40.45% (95%CI: 24.04-56.85), while coinfection was 10.14% (95%CI: 3.97-16.30), of which Mycoplasma pneumonia (50%, 95%CI: 28.24-71.76) and influenza virus or parainfluenza virus (22.76%, 95%CI: 4.76-40.77) were the most common pathogens. Both male and female children were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection. And the pooled proportion of family clustering infection was 83.63% (95%CI: 77.54-89.72). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of asymptomatic infections occurs in children infected with SARS-CoV2, who are also susceptible to coinfection regardless of sex. These data affirm the increasing public health burden arising from infected children regarding the causation of asymptomatic infection or misdiagnosis and as a significant contributor to virus spread. The public should pay more attention to children during epidemics and conduct multimethod detection to further effectively identify infected children and control the source of infection.

Methods: Three groups of children were enrolled into the prospective study during January 20 to February 20, 2020 from Capital Institute of Pediatrics, including children in the exposed group with ARI and epidemiological history associated with COVID-19 from whom both pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, children in the ARI group without COVID-19 associated epidemiological history and children in the screening group for hospital admission, with neither COVID-19 associated epidemiological history nor ARI. Only nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in the ARI group and screening group. Each group is expected to include at least 30 cases. All specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by two diagnostic kits from different manufacturers. All nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for multiple respiratory pathogens, whilst the results from the ARI group were compared with that in the correspondence periods of 2019 and 2018 used by t or chi(2) test. Results: A total of 244 children were enrolled into three groups, including 139 males and 105 females, the age was (5+-4) years. The test of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid were negative in all children, and high positive rates of pathogens were detected in exposed (69.4%, 25/36) and ARI (55.3%, 73/132) groups, with the highest positive rate for mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) (19.4%, 7/36 and 17.4%, 23/132, respectively), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (16.7%, 6/36 and 9.8%, 13/132, respectively). The positive rate (11.8%, 9/76) of pathogens in the screening group was low. In the same period of 2019, the positive rate of pathogens was 83.7% (77/92), with the highest rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (29.3%, 27/92), followed by influenza virus (Flu) A (H1N1) (19.6%, 18/92) and adenovirus (ADV) (14.1%, 13/92), which showed significant difference with the positive rates of the three viruses in 2020 (RSV A: chi(2)=27.346, P<0.01; FluA (H1N1): chi(2)=28.083, P<0.01; ADV: chi(2)=7.848, P=0.005) . In 2018, the positive rate of pathogens was 61.0% (50/82), with the highest rate for human bocavirus (HBoV) (13.4%, 11/82) and followed by ADV (11.0%, 9/82), and significant difference was shown in the positive rate of HBoV with that in 2020 (chi(2)=6.776, P=0.009). Conclusions: The infection rate of 2019-nCoV is low among children in Beijing with no family clustering or no close contact, even with epidemiological history. The spectrum of pathogens of ARI in children during the research period is quite different from that in the previous years when the viral infections were dominant.

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. RESULTS: Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679-0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310-9.353, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary."

Resistance to macrolides, the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection, is a major global public health concern. However, studies evaluating macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection simultaneously in all ages are limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in terms of age distribution. METHODS: We enrolled 292 patients in Tokyo, Japan, who visited Eiju General Hospital or Zama Children's Clinic in 2015-2016. Patients were tested using real-time PCR for M. pneumoniae DNA. PCR-positive patients (n = 151) were further selected and sequentially divided into preschool-aged children (<=5 years, n = 31), school-aged children (6-15 years, n = 101), adolescents (16-19 years, n = 5), and adults (>=20 years, n = 14). We then analyzed the M. pneumoniae infection clinical characteristics, prevalence of macrolide-resistant infection, and 23S rRNA domain V resistance-associated mutation status. RESULTS: We found insignificant differences in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection among all groups, clinical characteristics, and resistance-associated mutation status in patients with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection. We also found statistically higher prevalence of mutation-positive (n = 85) M. pneumoniae in patients previously treated with macrolide compared to the mutation-negative group (n = 66); 63.8% vs 11.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences in both clinical characteristics and prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection among all ages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined the association between infection and clinical outcomes in 44 patients with idiopathic TTP, with severely deficient ADAMTS13. We also investigated seasonality of the disease, hoping to better understand the epidemiology of idiopathic TTP. RESULTS: Summer demonstrated significantly lower incidence for idiopathic TTP, compared with other seasons P = 0.0003. Fourteen patients had 15 episodes with a suspected concomitant infection. Five initial episodes were triggered by an infection (33.3 %), all presenting in winter, six episodes were associated with an exacerbation (40 %) and infection triggered a relapse in the other four episodes (26.7 %), with 2 episodes presenting in winter. TTP associated infections included: central line infection, urinary tract infection and post-operative infection. One patient had respiratory tract infection, on both his initial and relapsing episodes. Refractoriness to treatment was demonstrated in 4 patients (28.6 %) and it was associated with dental abscess (one patient), septic shock (one patient) and Mycoplasma pneumonia (2 patients). All 4 patients had markedly elevated CRP values with a median of 335 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Most of the infection associated episodes developed in winter (77.8 %). In patients with idiopathic TTP refractory to conventional treatment, infection should be seriously considered as an additional contributing factor for their initial and /or recurrent episodes, particularly when CRP is markedly elevated."

Its treatment is difficult. The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of 20 cases of RMPP in children in order to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of RMPP. METHODS: The clinical data of 20 patients with RMPP admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in the recent three years were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical data of 36 patients with common mycoplasma pneumonia in the same period were compared. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and imaging characteristics of RMPP were discussed. Intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications and treatment were also analyzed in order to provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the refractory group and the general group in terms of heat duration, hospitalization time, hypoxemia, lung rales, CRP, ESR, PCT, LDH, ALT, PLT, WBC, D dimer and other laboratory examinations, intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, and treatment (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the age, sex, and wheezing between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Long duration of fever, tachycardia, and lung rale protrusion may be the clinical characteristics of RMPP. Unilateral pulmonary shadow and atelectasis should be paid more attention, which may be a high-risk factor for the development of RMPP. The inflammation index of RMPP cases increased and there were many complications inside and outside the patients' lungs.

METHODS: A total of 75 children with MPP and atelectasis were divided into a good response group with 51 children and a poor response group with 24 children according to the clinical effect of BAL treatment. LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the clinical effect of BAL treatment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and restricted cubic spline model analysis were used to evaluate the value of the course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment in predicting the clinical effect of BAL treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the good response group, the poor response group had a significantly lower percentage of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a significantly higher proportion of children with atelectasis of two or more lung lobes or stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening caused by inflammation, and a significantly longer course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment and azithromycin treatment (P<0.05). The LASSO logistic regression analysis showed that a prolonged course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment (OR=1.23), atelectasis of two or more lung lobes (OR=11.99), and stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening caused by inflammation (OR=5.31) were independent risk factors for poor clinical effect of BAL treatment (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that the course of disease of >=11.5 days at the time of BAL treatment suggested a poor clinical effect of BAL treatment, with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 54.9%. The restricted cubic spline model analysis showed that there was a non-linear dose-response relationship between the course of disease at the time of BAL treatment and the clinical effect of BAL treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early BAL treatment may have a good clinical effect in children with MPP and atelectasis. Atelectasis of two or more lung lobes and inflammation-induced stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening shown under bronchoscope may indicate a poor clinical effect of BAL treatment."

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with PCR-positive MPP requiring ICU admission in a children's hospital in Taipei, Taiwan from Jun 2010 to October 2019. Clinical manifestations and laboratory data of severe MPP were analyzed. Macrolide susceptibility was determined by genotyping, and its relationship with clinical manifestations was also analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately 5% (34/658) children hospitalized for MPP required ICU admission. Compared with non-ICU cases (n = 291), ICU cases (n = 34) were associated with more underlying conditions, more pleural effusion, longer fever duration, longer hospital stay, the requirement of second-line antibiotic treatment, and delayed effective and second-line antibiotic treatment. Macrolide resistance was similar in ICU and non-ICU groups (53% vs 53%; p = 0.986). In severe MPP, patients requiring endotracheal intubation were associated with more septic shock, empyema, ARDS, prolonged fever after effective antibiotic treatment, delayed second-line and effective antibiotic treatment. In 18 of the 22 patients with pleural fluid analysis, the pleural effusion was alkaline (pH > 7.7) and lymphocyte-predominant. CONCLUSION: M. pneumoniae infection can cause severe life-threatening pneumonia in children. Delayed effective and second-line antibiotic treatments are associated with severe life-threatening MPP."

These agents are mostly associated with infection in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these pathogens among patients with CAP attending outpatient clinics in Tehran. A cross-sectional study was carried out of 150 patients attending to educational hospitals in Tehran with CAP. M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected by PCR assay, targeting the P1 adhesion gene, macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively from throat swabs obtained from each patient. A total of 86 (57.3%) of 150 patients were women; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 35-65 years). M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 37 (24.7%), 25 (16.7%) and 11 (7.3%) patients respectively; of these, 66 patients (44%) were infected at least by one of these three pathogens. The frequency of L. pneumophila was significantly higher among patients over 60 years old (p 0.03). Coinfection was detected in seven patients (4.7%); six were infected by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and only one was infected by L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent agent of atypical CAP, and L. pneumophila was more likely to infect elderly rather than younger people. Further studies on the prevalence of CAP and its aetiologic agents are needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CAP patients."

This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children in a general hospital. Methods: A total of 2011 CAP children aged 1-16 years hospitalized at Peking University Third Hospital from 2017 to 2019 were enrolled by cross-sectional study for the retrospective analysis of the clinical data mainly including seasonal distribution of MPP, hospital stay, severity, complications, use of flexible bronchoscopy, and hospitalization costs. The dynamic changes of CAP and MPP children within 3 consecutive years and the differences between the MPP group and non-MPP groups were compared. Results: The proportion of CAP children among hospitalized children was 32.4%, 38.5%, and 39.5% in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, showing an upward trend (P<0.05).The prevalence rate of MPP was highest in the third quarter (30.2%) and the fourth quarter (39.2%) and lowest in the second quarter (13.2%) (chi2=51.8, P<0.05). Compared with the non-MPP group, the MPP group had significantly higher incidence of severe pneumonia (19.4% vs. 12.0%, chi2=20.99), incidence of complications (16.1% vs. 6.5%, chi2=48.24), proportion of patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy (38.4% vs. 9.0%, chi2=252.79), and hospitalization costs (all P<0.05), along with significantly longer hospital stay (6 vs. 4 days, z=-11.131). A dynamic comparison of the clinical characteristics of MPP in 3 years showed that the number of children with MPP increased significantly in preschoolers in 2018 (37.3%) and in school-aged or older children in 2019 (53%) (P<0.05). MPP peaks occurred in August 2018 and November 2019. The total hospitalization costs, examination fees, and non-medication treatment costs increased significantly (the z values were 35.24, 46.79, and 9.64, respectively; P<0.05) year by year among MPP children; there was no significant difference in the medication cost over these 3 years (z=4.81, P>0.05). Conclusions: The proportions of severe pneumonia, complications, and use of flexible bronchoscopy as well as the hospitalization days and costs are higher in MPP children. General hospitals should develop integrated clinical quality control programs for MPP children, so as to optimize the allocation of medical resources."

However, the clinical symptoms of most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are not significantly different from those of common respiratory viral infections. Therefore, knowing the epidemiological patterns of common respiratory viruses may be valuable to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of patients with suspected COVID-19, especially in Southwest China (a mild epidemic area). METHODS: A total of 2188 patients with clinically suspected of COVID-19 in Southwest China were recruited from January 21 to February 29, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputum specimens were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 by using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other 12 viruses via PCR fragment analysis combined with capillary electrophoresis. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test findings were acquired from electronic medical records. All data were analyzed to unravel the epidemiological patterns. RESULTS: Only 1.1% (24/2188) patients with suspected COVID-19 were eventually confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the most frequently observed symptoms were fever (75.0%, 18/24) and cough (20.8%, 5/24). The overall detection rate of other respiratory pathogens was 10.3% (226/2188). Among them, human rhinovirus (3.2%, 71/2188), human parainfluenza viruses (1.6%, 35/2188), influenza B virus (1.2%, 26/2188) and mycoplasma pneumonia (1.2%, 26/2188) were the predominantly detected pathogens in this study. Moreover, the co-infection was observed in 22 specimens. Notably, one COVID-19 case had a coexisting infection with human parainfluenza virus (4.2%, 1/24) and bocavirus was the most common virus tending to occur in co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the epidemiological features of common respiratory viruses and their clinical impact during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in a mild epidemic area. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the transmission patterns of the common respiratory virus in COVID-19 regions, which can provide information support for the development of appropriate treatment plans and health policies, while eliminating unnecessary fear and tension."

METHODS: Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 and 21 patients with adult mycoplasma pneumonia confirmed with RT-PCR test were enrolled from Zibo First Hospital and Lanshan People's Hospital during December 1st 2019 and March 14th 2020. The early chest CT manifestations were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The interstitial changes with ground glass density shadow (GGO) were similar in two groups during first chest CT examination (P>0.05). There were more lung lobes involved on the first chest CT in COVID-19 patients, which were mostly distributed in the dorsal outer zone (23/26, 88.5%), and nearly half of them (12/26, 46.2%) were accompanied by crazy-paving sign; while the lesions in adult mycoplasma pneumonia patients were mostly distributed along the bronchi, and the bronchial wall was thickened (19/21, 90.5%), accompanied with tree buds / fog signs (19/21, 90.5%). The above CT signs were significantly different between the two kinds of pneumonia (all P<0.01). COVID-19 had a longer course compared with mycoplasma pneumonia, the disease peaks of COVID-19 patients was on day (10.5+-3.8), while the disease on CT was almost absorbed on day (7.9+-2.2) in adult mycoplasma pneumonia. The length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients was significantly longer than that of mycoplasma pneumonia patients [(19.5+-4.3) d vs (7.9+-2.2) d, P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: The lesions of adult mycoplasma pneumonia are mostly distributed along the bronchi with tree buds/fog signs, while the lesions of COVID-19 are mainly distributed in the dorsal outer zone accompanied by crazy-paving sign, which can early distinguish two diseases."

Of note, clonal expansion of macrolide-resistant ST3 occurred in Japan and South Korea. An alarming surge in macrolide resistance complicated the treatment of pneumonia. We aimed to evaluate the clinical manifestation and the clonal relatedness of M. pneumoniae circulating among children in Taiwan. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 626 children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia between 2017 and 2019. M. pneumoniae infection was suspected on clinical grounds, and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction and oropharyngeal swab cultures. We used multi-locus sequence typing and whole-genome sequencing to characterize the genetic features of M. pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 226 children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Macrolide resistance was found in 77% (174/226) patients. Multi-locus sequence typing revealed that ST3 (n=93) and its single-locus variant ST17 (n=84) were the predominant clones among macrolide-resistant strains. ST17 presented clinical characteristics comparable to its ancestor ST3. On multivariate analysis, macrolide resistance (OR, 3.5; 95%IC, 1.4-8.5; P=0.007) was independently associated with fever >72 hours after macrolide treatment. By whole genome sequencing, prediction analysis of recombination sites revealed one recombination site in ST3 and ST17 compared with M29 (a macrolide-sensitive ST3 strain isolated from China in 2005))containing cytadhesin MgpC-like protein, RepMP4, and RepMP5. ST17 had another recombination site containing an adhesin and RepMP2/3. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to macrolide resistance, ST3 and its ST17 variant might evolve through recombination between repetitive sequences and non-P1 cytadhesins for persistent circulation in Taiwan."

Approximately 10% of cases develop clinical signs of pneumonia with ""atypical"" radiographic pattern. However, mycoplasma pneumoniae can be responsible for a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations, potentially involving all systems and apparatuses. Although exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not completely known, these could be secondary to direct invasion of the target organ, immunological damage due to molecular mimicry or vascular obstruction. A 45-year-old man was admitted to Internal Medicine Unit because of fever, dry cough and fatigue lasting 15 days. Fever disappeared after starting clarithromycin. About 72 h after admission the patient complained of right calf pain and tachypnea. The presence of anti-mycoplasma antibodies suggested mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Moreover, a diagnosis of venous thrombo-embolism was performed. Given the absence of classical risk factors for thrombosis, patient was investigated for inherited and acquired thrombophilia and tested positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. A review of the English literature on the association between m. pneumoniae and pulmonary embolism will be provided in order to underline the possible pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in this setting. Clinicians should outweigh risk and benefits for LMWH prophylaxis case by case considering these adjunctive pro-thrombotic mechanisms in patients m. pneumoniae infection."

A total of 13 (13.4%) patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nucleic acid RT-PCR testing, and 41 (42.3%) patients were found to be infected with other pathogens. Notably, no pathogen was detected in 43 (44.3%) patients. Among all patients, 25 (25.8%) had familial cluster exposure history, and 52 (53.6%) had one or more coexisting conditions. Fifteen (15.5%) patients were admitted or transferred to the PICU. In the 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 5 (45.5%) and 7 (63.6%) were positive for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In 22 patients with suspected COVID-19, 1 (4.5%) was positive for IgG but negative for IgM. The most frequently detected pathogen was Mycoplasma pneumonia (29, 29.9%). One patient with confirmed COVID-19 died. Our results strongly indicated that the detection of asymptomatic COVID-19 or coexisting conditions must be strengthened in pediatric patients. These cases may be difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 unless etiologic analysis is conducted.

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury. METHODS: In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases). RESULTS: We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase >=5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to >=1.5 times baseline or increase by >=27 mumol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases.

MP pneumonia is a risk factor for the development of post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO). The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for the development of PIBO after MP pneumonia in the era of increasing macrolide resistance of MP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 150 children with a mean age of 6.0 years admitted to the hospital due to MP pneumonia between May 2019 and February 2020 at a tertiary hospital. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data were obtained using retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Eighteen children (12%) were diagnosed with PIBO after MP pneumonia. PIBO was diagnosed after a mean duration of 100.0 days (range, 6-268 days) from symptom onset. The respiratory virus co-infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.069; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.224-13.523), adenovirus co-infection (aOR, 5.607; 95% CI, 1.801-17.454), longer duration between symptom onset and admission (aOR, 1.150; 95% CI, 1.020-1.298), higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of admission (aOR, 1.001; 95% CI, 1.000-1.003), and poor response to stepwise treatment increased the risk for development of PIBO after MP pneumonia. However, macrolide resistance of MP was not associated with development of PIBO after MP pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that respiratory virus co-infection, including adenovirus, poor response to the treatment of MP pneumonia, and higher levels of serum LDH, but not macrolide resistance of MP, are risk factors of PIBO after MP pneumonia."

We report the case of a 2 years and 9-month-old male child admitted with prolonged fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath for which he underwent symptomatic treatment. The laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers and the thoracic radiography revealed pleural effusion raising the suspicion of inferior right pneumonia. Although we the initial evolution was favorable being treated with 3rd class cephalosporin and Oxacillin, on the 8th day of admission the fever and the acute phase reactants levels increased as well as the quantity of the pleural effusion, requiring surgical drainage. We ruled out lung tuberculosis, but we identified positive IgM for both MP and CP. Based on these findings we changed the antibiotic therapy on Levofloxacin for 10 days with favorable evolution. MP and CP are two atypical pathogen that are difficult to be diagnosed due to their slow-growing pattern.

In the past, M. pneumoniae was sensitive to macrolide antibiotics, and M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) was usually a benign and self-limiting disease. However, despite use of the appropriate antibiotics, persistent fever and clinical deterioration may occur, leading to severe disease. Two major complicated conditions that may be clinically encountered are macrolide-resistant MPP and refractory MPP. Regarding the epidemics in Taiwan, before 2017, the mean rate of macrolide resistance was below 30%. Notably, since 2018, the prevalence of macrolide-resistant MPP in Taiwan has increased rapidly. Macrolide-resistant MPP shows persistent fever and/or no radiological regression to macrolide antibiotics and may even progress to severe and complicated pneumonia. Tetracyclines (doxycycline or minocycline) or fluoroquinolones are alternative treatments for macrolide-resistant MPP. Refractory MPP is characterized by an excessive immune response against the pathogen. In this context, corticosteroids have been suggested as an immunomodulator for downregulating the overactive host immune reaction. Overuse of macrolides may contribute to macrolide resistance, and thereafter, an increase in macrolide-resistant MPP. Delayed effective antimicrobial treatment is associated with prolonged and/or more severe disease. Thus, the appropriate prescription of antibiotics, as well as the rapid and accurate diagnosis of MPP, is important. The exact starting point, dose, and duration of the immunomodulator are yet to be established. We discuss these important issues in this review."

The purpose of this study was to investigate antibacterial drugs for treating CAP according to age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Japanese national database from 2011 to 2014, we analyzed the usage of antibiotics for CAP according to age. RESULTS: The numbers of claim information were 9,386, and 70% of the patients were aged >= 75 years. Sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) or ceftriaxone (CTRX) was used in 60%, but broad-spectrum antibiotics, combination therapy, and anti-mycoplasma antibiotics were used in 15 - 28% of all age groups. The 30-day survival rate did not differ between SBT/ABPC or CTRX vs. others. There was no difference in 30-day mortality and risk in any group between the ages of 15 and 64 years. On the other hand, the use of anti-mycoplasma antibiotics reduced the 30-day mortality by 0.50 times (p < 0.01), and the use of two or more antibiotics increased the 30-day mortality by 1.45 times (p = 0.02) at age >= 65 years. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the antibiotics used for CAP requiring hospitalization consisted of CTRX or SBT/ABPC as recommended by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) guidelines. On the other hand, the usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics and combination therapy were relatively frequent at all ages, although their use does not always contribute to survival.

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma amphoriformebID:33292668TITLE:Mycoplasma hyorhinis as a possible cause of fibrinopurulent meningitis in pigs? - a case series.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma hyorhinis is an invader of the upper respiratory tract in swine that is considered to have ubiquitous distribution. It is mainly known for causing polyserositis and polyarthritis in weaned piglets, even though the mechanisms of systemic spread are not fully understood. Mycoplasma hyorhinis has also been associated with other diseases in pigs such as pneumonia or otitis media, but so far has not been known to cause central nervous disorders. This case series reports the isolation of Mycoplasma hyorhinis from cerebrospinal fluid and/ or meningeal swabs from piglets originating from four different piglet producing farms in Austria. CASE PRESENTATION: On farm 1, coughing, stiff movement and central nervous signs occurred in nursery piglets. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was the only pathogen isolated from meningeal swabs from two piglets showing central nervous signs. Fibrinopurulent leptomeningitis was only observed in one piglet. Only one of two nursery piglets from farm 2 showed mild central nervous signs but no histologic lesions; Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of the piglet with neurologic signs. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of all three investigated piglets from farm 3, all of which showed central nervous signs and purulent leptomeningitis. Further, Streptococcus suis was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of one piglet. Fibrinopurulent leptomeningitis was detected in two piglets from farm 4 that had died overnight without showing any clinical signs and Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from meningeal swabs from both piglets. CONCLUSION: While causality has yet to be proven by experimental infection and in situ detection of the pathogen in histologic sections, the findings of this study and the absence of other pathogens suggest Mycoplasma hyorhinis as a potential causative agent of meningitis in swine."

Despite not being diagnostic for COVID-19, chest CT may help clinicians to isolate high suspicion patients with suggestive imaging findings. However, COVID-19 findings on CT are also common to other pulmonary infections and non-infectious diseases, and radiologists and point-of-care physicians should be aware of possible mimickers. This state-of-the-art review goal is to summarize and illustrate possible etiologies that may have a similar pattern on chest CT as COVID-19. The review encompasses both infectious etiologies, such as non-COVID viral pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and pulmonary granulomatous infectious, and non-infectious disorders, such as pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia."

Physicians may overprescribe antimicrobials owing to the concern of bacterial infections, including those because of atypical pathogens. We investigated the accuracy of clinical predictions concerning atypical pathogen infections. Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented with a fever and cough in outpatient clinics between December 2016 and August 2018. After taking a history and performing physical examinations, physicians predicted the possibility of respiratory infections because of atypical pathogens. Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: >=50%, intermediate: 20% >= and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. Results: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3-39.2) were associated with the detections. Atypical pathogens were detected in 32.3% of high-probability cases (10/31), while atypical pathogens were only detected in 8.8% of intermediate-probability cases (8/91) and 3.4% of low-probability cases (3/88) (P < .001). Conclusions: The current study indicates that physicians' predictions were associated with the detection of atypical pathogens; however, overestimation was observed."

Our study aimed to identify the effects of low-dose corticosteroids on the recovery of children with MPP. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, pediatric inpatients with MPP were included from the Shanghai Children's Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia cohort study between August 2014 and July 2019. The multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to investigate the effects of low-dose corticosteroid treatment on fever duration after admission, total fever duration, length of hospital stay, C-reactive protein recovery time, and imaging recovery time with the stratification of severe pneumonia, refractory pneumonia, inflammatory biomarkers, pulmonary images, and timing of corticosteroids. Results: There were 548 patients in the corticosteroid group and 337 in the no-corticosteroid group. The corticosteroid group showed severe clinical parameters such as more severe and refractory cases, higher laboratory values, and more abnormal imaging manifestations. The corticosteroid group also showed longer fever duration after admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.1), P = 0.008], longer total fever duration [OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.3), P = 0.011], longer hospital stay [OR = 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9-4.0), P < 0.001], and longer C-reactive protein (CRP) recovery time [OR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9), P = 0.021] in the regression model after the adjustment for severity. Although low-dose corticosteroids were associated with shortened imaging recovery time in patients with high level laboratory values, pulmonary imaging could be completely recovered in both groups. The trend of these results was consistent even after stratifications and a propensity scores matching analysis. Conclusions: Low-dose corticosteroids may not be beneficial in children inpatients with MPP, and further studies on proper treatment modality are needed in the MRMP era."

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are susceptible to infections due to the chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs and the autoimmune disorders. Now we report a case of SLE infected with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae concurrently. The patient used hydroxychloroquine and prednisone chronically to control the SLE. After infection of SARS-CoV-2, she was given higher dose of prednisone than before and the same dosage of hydroxychloroquine. Besides, some empirical treatments such as antiviral, antibiotic and immunity regulating therapies were also given. The patient finally recovered from COVID-19. This case indicated that hydroxychloroquine may not be able to fully protect SLE patient form SARS-CoV-2. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapies and increased dose of corticosteroids might be adoptable for patient with both COVID-19 and SLE. Physicians should consider SARS-CoV-2 virus test when SLE patient presented with suspected infection or SLE flare under the epidemic of COVID-19."

Mycoplasma is an uncommon co-infected pathogen with SARS-CoV-2 and has not yet been reported. Computed tomography (CT), used as an accessory examination, may play a more significant role in this co-infection. CASE SUMMARY: A 49-year-old female presented with a cough, expectoration and chest congestion followed by elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. CT images showed ground-glass opacities in bilateral lower lobes and a patchy and striate shadow in the right upper lobe. Immunoglobulin M antibody of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was positive and real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of sputum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The diagnosis of CoVID-19 was made based on laboratory results, chest CT images, clinical manifestations and epidemiologic characteristics. She was treated with combination therapy for 17 d and showed a marked reCoVery. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycoplasma in CoVID-19 patients appears to be uncommon. CT is an acceptable method for the primary diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Combination therapy with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, traditional Chinese herbal medicine and interferon inhalation may be a reference for further progress in treating this co-infection."

A retrospective study of inpatients diagnosed with CAP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dali University (Dali, Yunnan, China) between January 2018 and June 2020 was conducted. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data of the patients with CAP were analyzed. Univariate analyses identified predictors for MP infections. The discriminative power of C-reactive protein (CPR), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP/PCT and CPR/PCT >350 mug/ng was assessed by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A total of 552 CAP patients, including 247 (44.7%) with MP, 152 (27.6%) with SP and 153 (27.7%) with influenza A and B viruses, were enrolled. When comparing MP with SP, cough and CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng (odds ratio [OR]) 2.88, p < .001) were predictors for MP. CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng had 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity (AUC = 0.89, p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.81-0.94) to predict MP infections. Furthermore, similar results were again obtained when comparing MP with VP. CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng present better information (OR: 4.70; AUC = 0.92, p < .001, 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity). In addition, comparing MP and non-MP (SP and VP combined), CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng exhibited excellent performance (AUC = 0.90, 95%CI 0.83-0.95, p < .001, 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity).

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

The health systems are facing significant challenges in carrying out the diagnosis and treatment of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children. Levofloxacin is suitable for treating infectious diseases in various systems but limited in children due to arthropathy issues in weight-bearing joints. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in children with macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled six confirmed cases of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia who were admitted in the paediatric respiratory ward of Shandong provincial hospital Affiliated to Shandong first Medical University between 1st January 2020 and 29th February 2020. Levofloxacin was given to the patients through the intravenous or oral route as per the following dosages :<5 years, 8-10 mg/kg q12 h; >5 years, 8-10 mg/kg, qd for 10 days. The clinical data were collected and analysed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The average age of the enrolled cases was six years and nine months (range, four years, and seven months to eleven years and seven months). All cases were found to be drug-resistant and were treated with azithromycin combined with antibacterial drugs. Levofloxacin was used in the patient's refractory to macrolide antibiotics. The temperature of five cases returned to normal 1-2 days after treatment with levofloxacin, and the imaging of the four cases showed expected improvements. The gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological manifestations, joint symptoms, blood parameters, liver and kidney functions, and exercise conditions of the children were closely monitored. The follow-up time of the patients ranged from one week to five months. No drug-related adverse reactions were observed in patients during treatment or during follow-up. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms and imaging significantly improved after treatment with levofloxacin, and no drug-related adverse reactions were observed. Levofloxacin proved to be an effective and safe drug in the treatment of children with macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumonia. This study will provide a reference for evaluating the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in the paediatric population."

METHOD: A total of 430 patients with MPP were enrolled between January 2015 and December 2015 and divided into a general MPP (GMPP) group (n = 306) and a RMPP group (n = 124). Clinical data, D-D level, white blood cell (WBC) count, proportion of neutrophils (N%), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of RMPP. RESULTS: (1) Hospitalization time, preadmission fever duration, total fever duration, WBC, N %, CRP, LDH, ESR, ALT, AST, and D-D were significantly higher in the RMPP group than those in the GMPP group (all P < 0.05). (2) Correlation analysis showed that D-D was positively correlated with WBC, CRP, ESR, and LDH, and could be used to jointly evaluate the severity of the disease. (3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified preadmission fever duration, CRP, LDH and DD as independent risk factors for RMPP (all P < 0. 05). D-D had the highest predictive power for RMPP (P < 0.01). The D-D level also had a good ability to predict pleural effusion and liver injury (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum D-D levels were significantly increased in patients with RMPP, indicating that excessive inflammatory response and vascular endothelial injury with prolonged duration existed in this patient population. Increased levels of serum D-D may be used as an early predictor of RMPP and the occurrence of complications. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the early diagnosis of RMPP, early intervention and excessive inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma."

Chicago Associated Pathologists.ABSTRACT:Mycoplasma incognitus is a recently described organism that was originally isolated by Shyh-Ching Lo from spleen and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) tissue of patients with AIDS. The mycoplasm has since been found in selected AIDS autopsy cases in which there were tissues with unexplained areas of necrosis. Mycoplasma incognitus is now known to be closely related to Mycoplasma fermentans. In order to determine the incidence and distribution of M. fermentans/M. incognitus in an unselected series, we performed a retrospective immunohistochemical study of 42 HIV-positive autopsies from the Chicago AIDS autopsy series. One case (2.4%) was found to be positive. The patient was a 27-year-old white male homosexual who had no evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma nor of any other neoplastic disorder and who died of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Antigen was present in the macrophages of the patient's spleen, liver, and bone marrow but was not associated with areas of necrosis. All other tissues sampled from this case (brain, heart, testis, lymph nodes) were negative. In the remaining autopsies, organs of the reticuloendothelial system as well as other randomly selected tissues (e.g., lung, heart, testis, pancreas) were screened and found to be negative. Tissues from several non-AIDS autopsies were also found to be nonreactive for M. fermentans/M. incognitus. We conclude that M. fermentans/M. incognitus is not a common agent found in the Chicago AIDS population; that it may be identified in tissue without morphologic abnormality; and that it is not randomly present in non-AIDS autopsies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The purpose of this study was to probe that Mycoplasma fermentans is able to produce respiratory tract infection and migrate to several organs on an experimental infection model in hamsters. One hundred and twenty six hamsters were divided in six groups (A-F) of 21 hamsters each. Animals of groups A, B, C were intratracheally injected with one of the mycoplasma strains: Mycoplasma fermentans P 140 (wild strain), Mycoplasma fermentans PG 18 (type strain) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae Eaton strain. Groups D, E, F were the negative, media, and sham controls. Fragments of trachea, lungs, kidney, heart, brain and spleen were cultured and used for the histopathological study. U frequency test was used to compare recovery of mycoplasmas from organs. RESULTS: Mycoplasmas were detected by culture and PCR. The three mycoplasma strains induced an interstitial pneumonia; they also migrated to several organs and persisted there for at least 50 days. Mycoplasma fermentans P 140 induced a more severe damage in lungs than Mycoplasma fermentans PG 18. Mycoplasma pneumoniae produced severe damage in lungs and renal damage. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma fermentans induced a respiratory tract infection and persisted in different organs for several weeks in hamsters. This finding may help to explain the ability of Mycoplasma fermentans to induce pneumonia and chronic infectious diseases in humans."

For the MP-IgM-/IgG+ subgroup, a single serum MP-IgG level of >=92.67 RU/mL can be used as a reference criterion for the diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection. At admission, for patients with CAP, the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA MP-IgM positivity for MPP were 18.51% and 99.56%, respectively. MP-IgM positivity combined with MP-IgG >= 92.67 RU/mL increased the sensitivity to 40.12% and decreased the specificity to 94.29%. For paired serum samples obtained within seven days, an ELISA MP-IgG concentration change of >=1.48-fold and MP-IgG >= 92.67 RU/mL on day 7 were used as the diagnostic criteria for M. pneumoniae infection. Accordingly, the combination of qualitative MP-IgM detection and quantitative MP-IgG detection by ELISA is valuable for acute MPP diagnosis in adults."

The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and long-term prognosis of MPP-associated thrombosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 43 children with MPP-associated thrombosis between January 2013 and June 2019 at Beijing Children's Hospital. The results of blood coagulation studies, autoimmune antibody, thrombophilia screening, contrast-enhanced lung computed tomography, echocardiography, and blood vessel ultrasonography were analyzed, as were treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were diagnosed with SMPP. D-dimer was higher than 5.0 mg/L in 58.1% (25/43) of patients. The mean D-dimer level was 11.1 +- 12.4 mg/L. Anticardiolipin-IgM was positive in 60.0% of patients, beta2-glycoprotein-IgM in 64.0%, and lupus anticoagulant in 42.1%. Chest imaging revealed pulmonary consolidation with lobe distribution in all patients (2/3-1 lobe in 10 patients, > 1 lobe in 29 patients). In our experience, thrombosis can occur in a vessel of any part of the body, and it can be initially detected as late as 31 days after disease onset. Thrombosis in the brain and abdomen can occur early, at 5 days after disease onset. Pulmonary vessels were the most commonly involved sites in the current study, and accordingly chest pain was the most common symptom (32.6%), followed by neurological symptoms (14.0%) and abdominal pain (9.3%). Thirty-five percent of patients were asymptomatic with regard to thrombosis. All patients underwent anticoagulant therapy, and thrombus absorption took > 3 months in most patients. All patients were followed until October 2019, at which time 41 were asymptomatic and 2 had mild recurrent cough. CONCLUSIONS: SMPP with pulmonary consolidation (> 2/3 lobe) was the most strongly associated risk factor for thrombosis. Thrombosis-associated symptoms may be subtle, even absent. Elevated D-dimer, specifically > 11.1 mg/L (even > 5.0 mg/L), would assist in the early diagnosis of thrombosis. The long-term prognosis of thrombosis was good after timely administration of anticoagulant therapy."

METHODS: A total of 73 children with RMPP and 146 children with general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were included. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were obtained. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to determine optimal predictors. The nomogram was plotted by multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. RESULTS: The LASSO regression analysis identified lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, neutrophil ratio, and high fever as significant predictors of RMPP. This nomogram-illustrated model showed good discrimination, calibration, and clinical value. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.884 (95% CI, 0.823-0.945) in the training set and 0.881 (95% CI, 0.807-0.955) in the validating set. Calibration curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed good consistency between the predictions of the nomogram and the actual observations, and decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: A simple-to-use nomogram for predicting RMPP in early stage was developed and validated. This may help physicians recognize RMPP earlier."

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0-18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children &lt; 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2-18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health."

METHODS: Propensity score matching was used to select 73 children with RMPP (refractory group) and 146 children with non-refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (common group). The logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic spline model, and decision curve analysis were used to analyze the clinical value of LDH in predicting RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the incidence of high fever, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of neutrophils, and serum levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, hemoglobin, albumin, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and LDH (P&lt;0.05). There were also significant differences between the two groups in the Mycoplasma pneumoniae-DNA load in nasopharyngeal aspirates and the incidences of pleural effusion, pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, shortness of breath and skin lesions (P&lt;0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high fever, hemoglobin level, LDH level, and pulmonary consolidation were independent predictive factors for RMPP (OR=10.097, 0.956, 1.006, and 3.756; P&lt;0.05). The results of the restricted cubic spline analysis showed a non-linear dose-response relationship between the continuous changes of LDH and the development of RMPP (P&lt;0.01). The decision curve analysis showed that LDH had an important clinical value in predicting RMPP. CONCLUSIONS: LDH is an independent predictive factor for the development of RMPP and its intensity of association with the development of RMPP exhibits a non-linear dose-response relationship."

METHODS: A total of 196 hospitalized children (at age of 0-36 months) who were diagnosed with MPP from January 2014 to June 2018 were enrolled as study subjects. A total of 208 children (at age of 0-36 months) with pneumonia not caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection during the same period of time were enrolled as controls (non-MPP group). A retrospective analysis was performed for their clinical data. The two groups were compared in the pulmonary function on the next day after admission and on the day of discharge. The children with MPP were followed up to observe pulmonary function at weeks 2 and 4 after discharge. RESULTS: Compared with the non-MPP group, the MPP group had significant reductions in the ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory time (TPTEF/TE), ratio of volume to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory volume (VPTEF/VE), inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio, and tidal expiratory flow at 25% remaining expiration on the next day after admission and on the day of discharge (P&lt;0.05). In addition there were significant increases in the ratio of peak tidal expiratory flow to tidal expiratory flow at 25% remaining expiration, respiratory rate, effective airway resistance, and plethysmographic functional residual capacity per kilogram (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the normal reference values of pulmonary function parameters, both groups had reductions in VPTEF/VE and TPTEF/TE on the next day after admission; on the day of discharge, the MPP group still had reductions in VPTEF/VE and TPTEF/TE, while the non-MPP group had normal values. The MPP group had increases in VPTEF/VE and TPTEF/TE from the day of discharge to weeks 2 and 4 after discharge (P&lt;0.05), but TPTEF/TE still did not reach the normal value at week 4 after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Airway obstruction is observed in infants and young children with acute MPP or non-MPP, and the children with MPP have a higher severity of airway obstruction and a longer time for improvement, with a certain degree of airway limitation in the recovery stage."

This association has shifted to be related to flooding events and outdoor activities; few cases are related to high-risk factors found in immunosuppressed patients. Scarcely a handful of cases have serological evidence of immune response against Leptospira serovar Bratislava representing serogroup Australis, a serovar associated with poor reproductive performance in swine and horses, and recently with cats. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we describe a rare clinical presentation of disseminated Leptospira infection in an immunosuppressed 65-year-old woman. She was admitted to the emergency room with fever, bacteraemia, bilateral uveitis and pulmonary involvement. The patient denied outdoor activities; she only had wide exposure to faeces and urine from cats living in her home. Her medical history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed at the age of 18. She did not respond to medical treatment, and a splenectomy was performed. At age 60, she was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), and was treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) -Imatinib. The patient voluntarily discontinued the treatment for the last 6 months. After extensive workup, no microorganisms were identified by the commonly used stains in microbiology. The diagnosis was performed through dark-field microscopy, microagglutination test (MAT), Leptospira genus-specific PCR, the IS1500 PCR for identification of pathogenic species, and 16S based sequencing for the genus identification. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressed patients may acquire uncommon infections from ubiquitous microorganisms. In this case, serology evidence of exposure to Leptospira serovar Bratislava by MAT and the presence of the Leptospira genus were identified. It should be on mind for the diagnosis in otherwise healthy patients, and thoroughly search on splenectomised patients exposed to animals. Additionally, this report highlights the usefulness of PCR for diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening illness."

The pathogens of the disease may change for the misuse of antibiotics and the application of vaccines. Therefore, pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics may have changed. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics. METHOD: The current study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pathogens positive in children with S/L-PP under 14 years old at a single hospital between 1st Jan 2014 and 31st Dec 2018 retrospectively. The pathogens were detected by microbial cultivation, indirect immunofluorescence of the kit (PNEUMOSLIDE IgM), Elisa, and/or real-time PCR in the samples of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 593 children with S/L-PP received treatment at a single hospital during the study period by inclusion criteria. Four hundred fifty-one patients were single positive for one pathogen and 83 patients were positive for at least 2 pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) (72.34%) was the most commonly detected pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae) (8.77%). The prevalence of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time (p < 0.05). The positive rate of M.pneumoniae increased with ages of patients (p < 0.05). M.pneumoniae was statistically associated with the extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was statistically associated with abnormal white blood cells (WBCs) and C reactive proteins (CRPs) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M.pneumoniae was the most positive pathogen in children with S/L-PP. The positive rate of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time and the ages of children. M.pneumoniae was associated with extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was associated with abnormal WBCs and CRPs."

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with serologically-confirmed MPP or culture-confirmed other bacterial pneumonia (OBP). The distribution of affected areas, abnormalities in lateral bronchial lesions, the degree of air bronchogram, and previously reported findings on HRCT were evaluated for MPP and OBP. Predictive HRCT findings for MPP were determined by logistic regression analysis. We provisionally designed our HRCT criteria (negative, probable, or highly suspected) for diagnosing MPP and investigated the diagnostic yield of the HRCT criteria. RESULTS: Sixty-three MPP and 126 OBP patients were included in this study. Logistic regression analysis showed that the absence of peripheral predominance, bronchial wall thickening, lateral bronchial wall thickening, intralobular or lobular ground-glass opacities, intralobular ground-glass opacities connected to a lateral bronchus, and less air bronchogram in infiltrates were significant predictors of MPP. Our HRCT criteria showed that the sensitivity and specificity in negative, probable, and highly suspected MPP were 0.0 and 0.33, 1.0 and 0.69, and 0.5 and 0.98, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HRCT had considerable ability to detect a lateral bronchial abnormality and to diagnose or rule out MPP based on the distribution of affected areas, abnormalities in lateral bronchial lesions, and the degree of air bronchogram in the infiltrates."

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests. Our patient showed remarkable clinical and laboratory improvement with the therapy mentioned above."

Bacterial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional methods. This study assessed the clinical factors influencing bacterial mPCR results in patients with COP. Patients with COP admitted to a tertiary care hospital between November 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively assessed. Conventional methods included culture-based methods and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial mPCR that could identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia was performed. Bacterial mPCR was performed in a total of 342 patients with COP in the study. Bacterial mPCR alone provided etiology in 99 patients. The total etiologic diagnosis rates improved from 22.2 to 51.1% when bacterial mPCR was added to conventional methods. Additional diagnostic benefits of bacterial mPCR were more prominent in the prior antibiotic non-exposure group (77.8% vs 63.5%, P = 0.015) and in the low-risk group with low CURB 65 score (62.6% vs 44.9%, P = 0.005). Patients who required ICU care, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and patients with any underlying diseases were not associated with the additional pathogen detection rates using bacterial mPCR. By supplementing conventional diagnostic methods with bacterial mPCR-based methods, the overall pathogen detection rates improved in patients with COP. Moreover, the additional diagnostic usefulness of bacterial mPCR was significantly higher in patients without prior antibiotic exposure and in the mild-to-moderate-risk group with lower CURB 65 score."

OBJECTIVES: We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK. METHODS: Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female. Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19. Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate. Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention. This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients. Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops."

However, little is known about the impacts of air pollutants on pediatric admissions for Mycoplasma pneumonia. This study was conducted to investigate the impacts of air pollutants on pediatric hospital admissions for Mycoplasma pneumonia in Shanghai, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was applied to explore the association between pediatric hospital admissions and levels of air pollutants (fine particulate matter, particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide). Data on hospital admissions for pneumonia and levels of ambient air pollutants were obtained for the period of 2015 to 2018. Associations between pediatric admissions for Mycoplasma pneumonia and ambient air pollutants were calculated using logistic regression and described by the odds ratio and relevant 95% confidence interval. The hysteresis effects of air pollutants from the day of hospital admission to the previous 7 days were evaluated in single-pollutant models and multi-pollutant models with adjustments for weather variables and seasonality. Lag 0 was defined as the day of hospital admission, lag 1 was defined as the day before hospital admission, and so forth. RESULTS: In the single-pollutant models (without adjustment for other pollutants), pediatric hospital admissions for pneumonia were positively associated with elevated concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter. A 0.5% increase in daily admissions per 10-mug/m3 increase in the nitrogen dioxide level occurred at lag 1 and lag 2, and a 0.3% increase in daily admissions per 10-mug/m3 increase in fine particulate matter occurred at lag 1. In the multi-pollutant models, nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter remained significant after inclusion of particulate matter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated that higher levels of nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter increase the risk of pediatric hospitalization for Mycoplasma pneumonia in Shanghai, China. These findings imply that the high incidence of Mycoplasma pneumonia in children in Asia might be attributed to the high concentration of specific air pollutants in Asia."

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of viral and intracellular respiratory pathogens in children with SCD presenting with fever and/or ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, prospective, single-centre cohort study with nested case-control analysis was conducted on children with SCD admitted from October 2016 to October 2017 for fever and/or ACS to the paediatric department of Robert Debre university hospital, Paris, France. They were screened for 20 respiratory pathogens by a multiplex PCR in the nasopharynx (FilmArray). RESULTS: We included 101 children. M/F sex ratio of 0.45. The median age was 3.2 years (IQR: 1.4-8.2). At least one pathogen was isolated in 67 patients (67%). The most frequent viruses were as follows: rhinovirus (n=33), adenovirus (n=14), respiratory syncytial virus (n=13) and parainfluenza viruses (n=11). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in one case. Twenty-three (23%) presented with or developed ACS. A nested case-control analysis was performed, after pairing ACS with non-ACS children for age and inclusion period. There was no statistical association between any viral detection or multiple viral infection, and ACS (p=0.51) even though parainfluenza viruses were twice as common in ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Viral detection in febrile children with SCD is frequent, but its association with ACS was not demonstrated. In this study, M. pneumoniae was rare in young children with SCD experiencing ACS."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission revealed lesions of the corpus callosum and brain white matter. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer) on day 7 shows hypoperfusion (with right dominance) of bilateral upper parietal region. His condition improved gradually with symptomatic treatments alone, and he was discharged on day 13. The lesions on the MRI disappeared by day 15. Although this case might have suffered from leukoencephalopathy, clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) type II was suspected from the reversible splenial lesion. Except for the elevation (640 times) of mycoplasma pneumonia antibody titer (particle agglutination) in the serum, the blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid findings showed no significant abnormalities. We then considered this encephalopathy was related to mycoplasma pneumonia infection. Since no symptoms of mycoplasma infection except for neurologic symptoms were observed, indirect mechanism, such as immune-mediated reactions, is suggested to cause encephalopathy in this case."

Although single MP infection is common enough, MP and EBV coinfection have received little attention. Especially, the pathogenic role of EBV in lung when coinfection with MP, has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of EBV on MP pneumonia (MPP) in hospitalized children. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of MPP children who underwent screening for EBV by polymerase chain reaction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during hospitalization in 2014. Of total 147 patients, 68 patients were in the MP group and 79 were in the MP/EBV coinfection group. We found longer fever duration and higher CRP, IgA, IgG, interleukin-2 (IL-2), percentage of peripheral neutrophils levels, higher incidence of pulmonary consolidation and percentage of refractory MPP in coinfection group, when compared to those in MP group. In ROC curve analysis, IL-2 was useful for differentiating patients with coinfection from those with MP infection. Logistic regression analysis showed that the IL-2 >= 3.35 pg/ml (OR = 3.677) was a significant predictor regarding to MP/EBV coinfection. In conclusion, coinfection of EBV and MP poses a higher risk for prolonged symptoms. IL-2 could be used as a good predictor of coinfection."

They were divided into two groups based on MP infection: MP infection group (n = 97) and non-MP infection group (n = 113). We compared the variables of these two groups based on medical records.The MP infection group had higher ESR than the non-MP infection group. During hospitalization, the non-MP infection group had higher levels of WBC during hospital, LDH, PCT, and lower HB when compared to the MP infection group. No differences were found in the hs-CRP level, N%, PLT, ALT, CKMB, and cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) between MP and non-MP infection group. Likewise, no difference was found in fever duration or hospital stays between them. Totally 19 patients in the infection group had CAA with a rate of 19.59%; and 27 (23.89%) patients had CAA in the non-MP infection group. Unfortunately, no difference was found in CAA rate between the two groups.MP infection may occur simultaneously in children with Kawasaki disease. KD patients with MP infection tended to occur in older population. MP infection may not increase the risk of CAA, which still needs further large-scaled studies to confirm. Clinicians should be alert to KD patients with high level of ESR. MP should be screened and early treatment with macrolides should be given timely."

All people including children are generally susceptible to COVID-19, but the condition is relatively mild for children. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples. The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management. The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic. For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation."

Methods: Four hundred and fifty-four (male 210, female 244) children with pneumonia in Department of Pulmonology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were enrolled from July, 2018 to October, 2018. Pharyngeal swabs and venous blood were obtained on the first or the second day after hospitalization. Fluorescence detection quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA, MP culture and MP-IgM were used to detect MP simultaneously. MP infection is diagnosed if MP culture is positive or the two of the other three methods are positive. Pharyngeal swabs were acquired and detected using fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA and MP culture again for children with confirmed MP infection before discharge. The detection rates and quantitative changes of the three methods were compared, and chi(2) test was used for comparison among groups. Results: A total of 454 hospitalized children with pneumonia were included in this study. The detection rates of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA, MP culture and MP-IgM IgM were 43.6% (198/454), 43.2% (196/454), 40.0% (180/454) and 30.6% (139/454) respectively. The difference of detection rates of the four methods was statistically significant (chi(2)=20.8, P<0.05),but no significant difference between the detection rates of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA and thermostatic amplification of RNA was found (chi(2)=0.018, P=0.900). They both had higher detection rates than MP-IgM or MP culture. MP infection is diagnosed if MP culture is positive or the two of the other three methods are positive, and two hundred and nine children were diagnosed as MP infection. In the second test of MP infection in 209 children before discharge, the positive rate of MP culture was 67.5% (141/209), with 39.4% (13/33) changed from negative to positive, and 27.3% (48/176) changed from positive to negative. The positive rate of thermostatic amplification of RNA was 82.3% (172/209), with 16.2% (31/191) turned from positive to negative, and 66.7% (12/18) turned from negative to positive. The positive rate of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA was 67.0% (140/209), with 52.9% (18/34) cases changed from negative to positive, and 30.3% (53/175) cases changed from positive to negative. MP-DNA load decreased in 141 cases (67.5%) and increased in 68 cases (32.5%) in the second test among the positive samples tested by fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA. The detection rates of the four methods in the non-severe group and the severe group were similar, and the differences among the groups were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). In the second test, the proportion of changing from negative to positive in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group, but only the difference in the thermostatic amplification of RNA was statistically significant (P=0.038) and the cases of changing from negative to positive of thermostatic amplification of RNA in the severe group and non-severe group are 7 and 5 respectively. Conclusions: The methods of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid detection have high sensitivity and application value in the etiological diagnosis of acute MP infection in children. The results of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA and thermostatic amplification of RNA are highly consistent, and they are both more advantageous than MP-IgM. Repeated testing in the acute phase is helpful to find MP infection children whose first test is negative. The load of MP-DNA did not decrease in some children in the acute stage after antibiotic treatment."

Establishing an early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may have important therapeutic implications. METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS in a case series of adults and youth hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort study in two university teaching hospitals, from November 2017 to October 2019. RESULTS: In all 10 patients, early and rapid diagnosis for severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS was achieved with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. The average PaO2/FiO2 of all patients was 180 mmHg. Of the 10 cases, 4 cases had moderate ARDS (100 mmHg <= PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg) and 3 cases had severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was applied in all patients, though only two patients were sufficiently supported with HFNC. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was required in 5 patients. High resistance (median 15 L/cmH2O/s) and low compliance (median 38 ml/cmH2O) was observed in 4 cases. In these 4 cases, recruitment maneuvers (RM) were applied, with 1 patient demonstrating no response to RM. Prone positioning were applied in 4 cases. Two cases needed ECMO support with median support duration of 5.5 days. No patient in our case series received corticosteroid therapy. All patients were survived and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Early and rapid diagnosis of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS can be achieved with PCR/mNGS tests in samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. In our case series, half of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS cases were adequately supported with HFNC or NIV, while half of cases required intubation. RM and prone position were effective in 30% of intubated cases, and 20% needed ECMO support. When early anti-mycoplasmal antibiotics were given together with sufficient respiratory support, the survival rate was high with no need for corticosteroid use."

METHODS: Computer search for PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBMdisc), China Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang, VIP (VIP), and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AZI combined with GC in the treatment of children with refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia test (RCT), the search time limit is built until March 20, 2019. Two researchers independently performed literature screening, data extraction, and literature risk bias, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs were included, including 1130 patients. Meta-analysis showed that AZI combined with GC therapy significantly improved the total effective rate of the disease compared with the conventional treatment group (odds ratio [OR] = 6.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.03, 10.07; P < .00001; I = 0%), effectively shortened the antipyretic time (SMD = -2.29; 95% CI -2.70, -1.88; P < .0001); promoted lung inflammation absorption (SMD = -1.89; 95% CI -2.38, -1.40; P < .0001), reduced cough time (SMD = -2.39; 95% CI -2.80, -1.99; P < .0001); shortened hospital stay (SMD = -2.19; 95% CI -3.21, -1.17; P < .0001); improved imaging findings (OR = 5.38; 95% CI 1.09, 26.51, P = .04); reduced inflammation index (SMD = -3.15; 95% CI -4.93, -1.36; P = .004); improved immune function (SMD = 1.29; 95% CI -0.02, 2.60; P < .0001); had no significant adverse reactions (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.71, 1.98; P = .53). CONCLUSIONS: According to the current limited research evidence, the addition of GCs to the conventional treatment of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children can improve the clinical efficacy to a certain extent, and the safety is better.

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

We analyzed the clinical characteristics and the risk factors for NP caused by MP. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in 37 patients with NP caused by MP (NP group) and 74 patients diagnosed with lobar M. pneumoniae pneumonia with no necrosis (control group) who were admitted to our hospital between January 2013 and December 2017. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data, imaging findings, treatments and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of females, the incidence of pleural effusion, fever duration, hospitalization days, white blood cell count, neutrophil ratio, D-dimer level and use of other types of antibiotics were higher in the NP group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The control group exhibited a greater use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) than the NP group (P < 0.05). According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a white blood cell count > 12.3 x 109/L (Odds ratio, OR = 6.412), a neutrophil ratio > 73.9% (OR = 6.081) and D-dimer level > 1367.5 ng/mL (OR = 8.501) were risk factors for pulmonary necrosis caused by MP. Furthermore, the use of LMWH (OR = 0.074) reduced the risk of pulmonary necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: NP is a rare complication of severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (SMPP), and although the clinical course is longer than common MP infection, the necrotic area is absorbed gradually. In patients with SMPP presenting with lobar consolidation, a white blood cell count > 12.3 x 109/L, a neutrophil ratio > 73.9% and D-dimer level > 1367.5 ng/mL are risk factors for pulmonary necrosis, and the use of LMWH reduces the risk of pulmonary necrosis."

Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children's Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."

The coinfection rate of M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) can reach 52% in some areas, but the effects of coinfection with different pathogens have not been clearly recognized. METHODS: The cases of MPP hospitalized in Beijing Children's Hospital from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2016 were screened. MPP patients coinfected with Human adenovirus (HAdV) were categorized into the research group. Patients with single M. pneumoniae infection were categorized into the control group, matching the research group by age and admission time with a ratio of 1:3. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and disease severity were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 2540 hospitalized MPP cases were screened in Beijing Children's Hospital, among which thirty cases were enrolled in the research group and ninety cases were enrolled in the control group. The results indicated that patients in the research group had longer hospital stays, longer fever durations and a higher rate of dyspnea, as well as a larger proportion applications of oxygen therapy and noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). No obvious differences were found in lab examinations within the two groups. Regarding disease severity, the proportions of extremely severe pneumonia and severe disease defined by the clinical score system were higher in the research group than in the control group.

RESULTS: The MPP with hypoxia patients (n = 69) had longer disease duration, a higher extra-pulmonary complications rate, and more severe radiological abnormalities (P < 0.05). They also needed more complicated treatments (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the levels of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin (IL)-6, ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen (FG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the percentage of neutrophils in the MPP with hypoxia group were significantly higher than those in the RMPP group and the GMPP group (P < 0.05).

This study aimed to systematically review the current situation and public health burden associated with children infected with SARS-CoV2. METHODS: We searched 4 electronic databases without language limitations. The pooled proportion or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each analysis to explore the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and coinfection, as well as to assess the sex of SARS-CoV-2-infected children. RESULTS: We obtained data from 14 eligible studies with 410 patients for the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection was 40.45% (95%CI: 24.04-56.85), while coinfection was 10.14% (95%CI: 3.97-16.30), of which Mycoplasma pneumonia (50%, 95%CI: 28.24-71.76) and influenza virus or parainfluenza virus (22.76%, 95%CI: 4.76-40.77) were the most common pathogens. Both male and female children were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection. And the pooled proportion of family clustering infection was 83.63% (95%CI: 77.54-89.72). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of asymptomatic infections occurs in children infected with SARS-CoV2, who are also susceptible to coinfection regardless of sex. These data affirm the increasing public health burden arising from infected children regarding the causation of asymptomatic infection or misdiagnosis and as a significant contributor to virus spread. The public should pay more attention to children during epidemics and conduct multimethod detection to further effectively identify infected children and control the source of infection.

In the same period of 2019, the positive rate of pathogens was 83.7% (77/92), with the highest rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (29.3%, 27/92), followed by influenza virus (Flu) A (H1N1) (19.6%, 18/92) and adenovirus (ADV) (14.1%, 13/92), which showed significant difference with the positive rates of the three viruses in 2020 (RSV A: chi(2)=27.346, P<0.01; FluA (H1N1): chi(2)=28.083, P<0.01; ADV: chi(2)=7.848, P=0.005) . In 2018, the positive rate of pathogens was 61.0% (50/82), with the highest rate for human bocavirus (HBoV) (13.4%, 11/82) and followed by ADV (11.0%, 9/82), and significant difference was shown in the positive rate of HBoV with that in 2020 (chi(2)=6.776, P=0.009). Conclusions: The infection rate of 2019-nCoV is low among children in Beijing with no family clustering or no close contact, even with epidemiological history. The spectrum of pathogens of ARI in children during the research period is quite different from that in the previous years when the viral infections were dominant. MP is the highest positively detected one among the main pathogens during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing where there is no main outbreak area."

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. RESULTS: Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679-0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310-9.353, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary."

Resistance to macrolides, the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection, is a major global public health concern. However, studies evaluating macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection simultaneously in all ages are limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in terms of age distribution. METHODS: We enrolled 292 patients in Tokyo, Japan, who visited Eiju General Hospital or Zama Children's Clinic in 2015-2016. Patients were tested using real-time PCR for M. pneumoniae DNA. PCR-positive patients (n = 151) were further selected and sequentially divided into preschool-aged children (<=5 years, n = 31), school-aged children (6-15 years, n = 101), adolescents (16-19 years, n = 5), and adults (>=20 years, n = 14). We then analyzed the M. pneumoniae infection clinical characteristics, prevalence of macrolide-resistant infection, and 23S rRNA domain V resistance-associated mutation status. RESULTS: We found insignificant differences in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection among all groups, clinical characteristics, and resistance-associated mutation status in patients with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection. We also found statistically higher prevalence of mutation-positive (n = 85) M. pneumoniae in patients previously treated with macrolide compared to the mutation-negative group (n = 66); 63.8% vs 11.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences in both clinical characteristics and prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection among all ages. Also, previous macrolide treatment contributes to drug-resistance."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined the association between infection and clinical outcomes in 44 patients with idiopathic TTP, with severely deficient ADAMTS13. We also investigated seasonality of the disease, hoping to better understand the epidemiology of idiopathic TTP. RESULTS: Summer demonstrated significantly lower incidence for idiopathic TTP, compared with other seasons P = 0.0003. Fourteen patients had 15 episodes with a suspected concomitant infection. Five initial episodes were triggered by an infection (33.3 %), all presenting in winter, six episodes were associated with an exacerbation (40 %) and infection triggered a relapse in the other four episodes (26.7 %), with 2 episodes presenting in winter. TTP associated infections included: central line infection, urinary tract infection and post-operative infection. One patient had respiratory tract infection, on both his initial and relapsing episodes. Refractoriness to treatment was demonstrated in 4 patients (28.6 %) and it was associated with dental abscess (one patient), septic shock (one patient) and Mycoplasma pneumonia (2 patients). All 4 patients had markedly elevated CRP values with a median of 335 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Most of the infection associated episodes developed in winter (77.8 %). In patients with idiopathic TTP refractory to conventional treatment, infection should be seriously considered as an additional contributing factor for their initial and /or recurrent episodes, particularly when CRP is markedly elevated."

The disease was officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). The clinical symptoms may include fever, cough, fatigue, headache, and diarrhea. The radiographic features comprise various presentations, including ground-glass opacities, tiny nodules, and consolidation. However, some atypical pathogens related to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may share similar presentations. They may be difficult to distinguish according to the clinical presentation and radiographic findings. Recently, there have been several reports reminding physicians to heed the possibility of co-infection with other pathogens in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We report a COVID-19 patient co-infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae who recovered well after combination therapy.

Its treatment is difficult. The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of 20 cases of RMPP in children in order to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of RMPP. METHODS: The clinical data of 20 patients with RMPP admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in the recent three years were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical data of 36 patients with common mycoplasma pneumonia in the same period were compared. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and imaging characteristics of RMPP were discussed. Intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications and treatment were also analyzed in order to provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the refractory group and the general group in terms of heat duration, hospitalization time, hypoxemia, lung rales, CRP, ESR, PCT, LDH, ALT, PLT, WBC, D dimer and other laboratory examinations, intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, and treatment (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the age, sex, and wheezing between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Long duration of fever, tachycardia, and lung rale protrusion may be the clinical characteristics of RMPP. Unilateral pulmonary shadow and atelectasis should be paid more attention, which may be a high-risk factor for the development of RMPP. The inflammation index of RMPP cases increased and there were many complications inside and outside the patients' lungs. It was necessary to give enough macrolides to fight the infection by using Glucocorticoid and Intravenous immunoglobulin reasonably while liver, heart, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy was completed to improve the effectiveness of the diagnosis and treatment."

METHODS: A total of 75 children with MPP and atelectasis were divided into a good response group with 51 children and a poor response group with 24 children according to the clinical effect of BAL treatment. LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the clinical effect of BAL treatment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and restricted cubic spline model analysis were used to evaluate the value of the course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment in predicting the clinical effect of BAL treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the good response group, the poor response group had a significantly lower percentage of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a significantly higher proportion of children with atelectasis of two or more lung lobes or stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening caused by inflammation, and a significantly longer course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment and azithromycin treatment (P<0.05). The LASSO logistic regression analysis showed that a prolonged course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment (OR=1.23), atelectasis of two or more lung lobes (OR=11.99), and stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening caused by inflammation (OR=5.31) were independent risk factors for poor clinical effect of BAL treatment (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that the course of disease of >=11.5 days at the time of BAL treatment suggested a poor clinical effect of BAL treatment, with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 54.9%. The restricted cubic spline model analysis showed that there was a non-linear dose-response relationship between the course of disease at the time of BAL treatment and the clinical effect of BAL treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early BAL treatment may have a good clinical effect in children with MPP and atelectasis. Atelectasis of two or more lung lobes and inflammation-induced stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening shown under bronchoscope may indicate a poor clinical effect of BAL treatment."

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with PCR-positive MPP requiring ICU admission in a children's hospital in Taipei, Taiwan from Jun 2010 to October 2019. Clinical manifestations and laboratory data of severe MPP were analyzed. Macrolide susceptibility was determined by genotyping, and its relationship with clinical manifestations was also analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately 5% (34/658) children hospitalized for MPP required ICU admission. Compared with non-ICU cases (n = 291), ICU cases (n = 34) were associated with more underlying conditions, more pleural effusion, longer fever duration, longer hospital stay, the requirement of second-line antibiotic treatment, and delayed effective and second-line antibiotic treatment. Macrolide resistance was similar in ICU and non-ICU groups (53% vs 53%; p = 0.986). In severe MPP, patients requiring endotracheal intubation were associated with more septic shock, empyema, ARDS, prolonged fever after effective antibiotic treatment, delayed second-line and effective antibiotic treatment. In 18 of the 22 patients with pleural fluid analysis, the pleural effusion was alkaline (pH > 7.7) and lymphocyte-predominant. CONCLUSION: M. pneumoniae infection can cause severe life-threatening pneumonia in children. Delayed effective and second-line antibiotic treatments are associated with severe life-threatening MPP."

These agents are mostly associated with infection in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these pathogens among patients with CAP attending outpatient clinics in Tehran. A cross-sectional study was carried out of 150 patients attending to educational hospitals in Tehran with CAP. M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected by PCR assay, targeting the P1 adhesion gene, macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively from throat swabs obtained from each patient. A total of 86 (57.3%) of 150 patients were women; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 35-65 years). M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 37 (24.7%), 25 (16.7%) and 11 (7.3%) patients respectively; of these, 66 patients (44%) were infected at least by one of these three pathogens. The frequency of L. pneumophila was significantly higher among patients over 60 years old (p 0.03). Coinfection was detected in seven patients (4.7%); six were infected by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and only one was infected by L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent agent of atypical CAP, and L. pneumophila was more likely to infect elderly rather than younger people.

This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children in a general hospital. Methods: A total of 2011 CAP children aged 1-16 years hospitalized at Peking University Third Hospital from 2017 to 2019 were enrolled by cross-sectional study for the retrospective analysis of the clinical data mainly including seasonal distribution of MPP, hospital stay, severity, complications, use of flexible bronchoscopy, and hospitalization costs. The dynamic changes of CAP and MPP children within 3 consecutive years and the differences between the MPP group and non-MPP groups were compared. Results: The proportion of CAP children among hospitalized children was 32.4%, 38.5%, and 39.5% in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, showing an upward trend (P<0.05).The prevalence rate of MPP was highest in the third quarter (30.2%) and the fourth quarter (39.2%) and lowest in the second quarter (13.2%) (chi2=51.8, P<0.05). Compared with the non-MPP group, the MPP group had significantly higher incidence of severe pneumonia (19.4% vs. 12.0%, chi2=20.99), incidence of complications (16.1% vs. 6.5%, chi2=48.24), proportion of patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy (38.4% vs. 9.0%, chi2=252.79), and hospitalization costs (all P<0.05), along with significantly longer hospital stay (6 vs. 4 days, z=-11.131). A dynamic comparison of the clinical characteristics of MPP in 3 years showed that the number of children with MPP increased significantly in preschoolers in 2018 (37.3%) and in school-aged or older children in 2019 (53%) (P<0.05). MPP peaks occurred in August 2018 and November 2019. The total hospitalization costs, examination fees, and non-medication treatment costs increased significantly (the z values were 35.24, 46.79, and 9.64, respectively; P<0.05) year by year among MPP children; there was no significant difference in the medication cost over these 3 years (z=4.81, P>0.05).

However, the clinical symptoms of most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are not significantly different from those of common respiratory viral infections. Therefore, knowing the epidemiological patterns of common respiratory viruses may be valuable to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of patients with suspected COVID-19, especially in Southwest China (a mild epidemic area). METHODS: A total of 2188 patients with clinically suspected of COVID-19 in Southwest China were recruited from January 21 to February 29, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputum specimens were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 by using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other 12 viruses via PCR fragment analysis combined with capillary electrophoresis. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test findings were acquired from electronic medical records. All data were analyzed to unravel the epidemiological patterns. RESULTS: Only 1.1% (24/2188) patients with suspected COVID-19 were eventually confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the most frequently observed symptoms were fever (75.0%, 18/24) and cough (20.8%, 5/24). The overall detection rate of other respiratory pathogens was 10.3% (226/2188). Among them, human rhinovirus (3.2%, 71/2188), human parainfluenza viruses (1.6%, 35/2188), influenza B virus (1.2%, 26/2188) and mycoplasma pneumonia (1.2%, 26/2188) were the predominantly detected pathogens in this study. Moreover, the co-infection was observed in 22 specimens. Notably, one COVID-19 case had a coexisting infection with human parainfluenza virus (4.2%, 1/24) and bocavirus was the most common virus tending to occur in co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the epidemiological features of common respiratory viruses and their clinical impact during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in a mild epidemic area. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the transmission patterns of the common respiratory virus in COVID-19 regions, which can provide information support for the development of appropriate treatment plans and health policies, while eliminating unnecessary fear and tension."

The early chest CT manifestations were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The interstitial changes with ground glass density shadow (GGO) were similar in two groups during first chest CT examination (P>0.05). There were more lung lobes involved on the first chest CT in COVID-19 patients, which were mostly distributed in the dorsal outer zone (23/26, 88.5%), and nearly half of them (12/26, 46.2%) were accompanied by crazy-paving sign; while the lesions in adult mycoplasma pneumonia patients were mostly distributed along the bronchi, and the bronchial wall was thickened (19/21, 90.5%), accompanied with tree buds / fog signs (19/21, 90.5%). The above CT signs were significantly different between the two kinds of pneumonia (all P<0.01). COVID-19 had a longer course compared with mycoplasma pneumonia, the disease peaks of COVID-19 patients was on day (10.5+-3.8), while the disease on CT was almost absorbed on day (7.9+-2.2) in adult mycoplasma pneumonia.

Of note, clonal expansion of macrolide-resistant ST3 occurred in Japan and South Korea. An alarming surge in macrolide resistance complicated the treatment of pneumonia. We aimed to evaluate the clinical manifestation and the clonal relatedness of M. pneumoniae circulating among children in Taiwan. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 626 children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia between 2017 and 2019. M. pneumoniae infection was suspected on clinical grounds, and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction and oropharyngeal swab cultures. We used multi-locus sequence typing and whole-genome sequencing to characterize the genetic features of M. pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 226 children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Macrolide resistance was found in 77% (174/226) patients. Multi-locus sequence typing revealed that ST3 (n=93) and its single-locus variant ST17 (n=84) were the predominant clones among macrolide-resistant strains. ST17 presented clinical characteristics comparable to its ancestor ST3. On multivariate analysis, macrolide resistance (OR, 3.5; 95%IC, 1.4-8.5; P=0.007) was independently associated with fever >72 hours after macrolide treatment. By whole genome sequencing, prediction analysis of recombination sites revealed one recombination site in ST3 and ST17 compared with M29 (a macrolide-sensitive ST3 strain isolated from China in 2005))containing cytadhesin MgpC-like protein, RepMP4, and RepMP5. ST17 had another recombination site containing an adhesin and RepMP2/3. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to macrolide resistance, ST3 and its ST17 variant might evolve through recombination between repetitive sequences and non-P1 cytadhesins for persistent circulation in Taiwan."

A 45-year-old man was admitted to Internal Medicine Unit because of fever, dry cough and fatigue lasting 15 days. Fever disappeared after starting clarithromycin. About 72 h after admission the patient complained of right calf pain and tachypnea. The presence of anti-mycoplasma antibodies suggested mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Moreover, a diagnosis of venous thrombo-embolism was performed. Given the absence of classical risk factors for thrombosis, patient was investigated for inherited and acquired thrombophilia and tested positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. A review of the English literature on the association between m. pneumoniae and pulmonary embolism will be provided in order to underline the possible pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in this setting. Clinicians should outweigh risk and benefits for LMWH prophylaxis case by case considering these adjunctive pro-thrombotic mechanisms in patients m. pneumoniae infection."

However, approaches to distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have not yet been reported. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 97 children with probable COVID-19. A total of 13 (13.4%) patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nucleic acid RT-PCR testing, and 41 (42.3%) patients were found to be infected with other pathogens. Notably, no pathogen was detected in 43 (44.3%) patients. Among all patients, 25 (25.8%) had familial cluster exposure history, and 52 (53.6%) had one or more coexisting conditions. Fifteen (15.5%) patients were admitted or transferred to the PICU. In the 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 5 (45.5%) and 7 (63.6%) were positive for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In 22 patients with suspected COVID-19, 1 (4.5%) was positive for IgG but negative for IgM. The most frequently detected pathogen was Mycoplasma pneumonia (29, 29.9%). One patient with confirmed COVID-19 died. Our results strongly indicated that the detection of asymptomatic COVID-19 or coexisting conditions must be strengthened in pediatric patients. These cases may be difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 unless etiologic analysis is conducted. A serologic test can be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in cases where SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly suspected but the nucleic acid test is negative."

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury. METHODS: In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases). RESULTS: We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase >=5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to >=1.5 times baseline or increase by >=27 mumol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases. CONCLUSION: Bacterial atypical pneumonia may occasionally induce myositis and secondary kidney damage."

A retrospective study of MPP patients with large pulmonary lesions hospitalized from January 2008 to December 2019 was enrolled, and clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiological findings were analyzed. Of 135 MPP patients with large pulmonary lesions, 56 were in the NP group, 79 were in the NNP group. We found the median length of fever days were much longer in NP group than those in NNP group. Higher levels of WBC, CRP, LDH, IL-6 in NP group were observed. Furthermore, the incidence of pulmonary consolidation was much higher in NP patients than that in NNP patients, while the CT value of large pulmonary lesion was much lower in NP patients. In ROC curve analysis, the cut-off values for the CT value and IFN-gamma were 36.43 and 7.25 pg/ml, respectively. NP caused by MPP might be easier to suffer from prolonged clinical course, severe laboratory and radiological findings. CT value of large pulmonary lesions and IFN-gamma could be used as biomarkers to predict NP from MPP with large pulmonary lesions in children."

Pneumoniae Associated with Mutation in 23S RNA Gene among Iranian Patients with Respiratory Infections.ABSTRACT:Background: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The global increased resistance of M. pneumoniae strains to macrolide (ML) has become a worrisome health problem. The widespread use of these medications has led to increased rate of reported ML-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) throughout the world. This study was aimed to evaluate the resistance of M. pneumoniae against erythromycin due to mutations in the 23S rRNA gene of patients with respiratory infections in Iran. Methods: In this study, 100 samples of throat swab from a patient with respiratory problems were collected. After the cultured of all samples in M. pneumonia-specific PPLO medium, PCR technique was performed with specific primers. Afterwards, the broth micro-dilution MIC assay was employed. Finally, the PCR product of the 23S rRNA gene was sequenced to detect mutations of domain V in 23S rRNA gene of MRMP. Results: It was found that 17 cases (17%) were positive for mycoplasma genus and six cases (6%) positive for M. pneumoniae species. Also, analysis of the sequence of 23S rRNA gene, revealed that one of the samples had mutations at positions A2431G and G2491A. All positive samples M. pneumoniae with 23S rRNA gene were sensitive to erythromycin. Conclusion: These use of these antibiotics should be limited to prevent the emergence of MRMP in Iran."

MP pneumonia is a risk factor for the development of post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO). The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for the development of PIBO after MP pneumonia in the era of increasing macrolide resistance of MP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 150 children with a mean age of 6.0 years admitted to the hospital due to MP pneumonia between May 2019 and February 2020 at a tertiary hospital. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data were obtained using retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Eighteen children (12%) were diagnosed with PIBO after MP pneumonia. PIBO was diagnosed after a mean duration of 100.0 days (range, 6-268 days) from symptom onset. The respiratory virus co-infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.069; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.224-13.523), adenovirus co-infection (aOR, 5.607; 95% CI, 1.801-17.454), longer duration between symptom onset and admission (aOR, 1.150; 95% CI, 1.020-1.298), higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of admission (aOR, 1.001; 95% CI, 1.000-1.003), and poor response to stepwise treatment increased the risk for development of PIBO after MP pneumonia. However, macrolide resistance of MP was not associated with development of PIBO after MP pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that respiratory virus co-infection, including adenovirus, poor response to the treatment of MP pneumonia, and higher levels of serum LDH, but not macrolide resistance of MP, are risk factors of PIBO after MP pneumonia."

We report the case of a 2 years and 9-month-old male child admitted with prolonged fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath for which he underwent symptomatic treatment. The laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers and the thoracic radiography revealed pleural effusion raising the suspicion of inferior right pneumonia. Although we the initial evolution was favorable being treated with 3rd class cephalosporin and Oxacillin, on the 8th day of admission the fever and the acute phase reactants levels increased as well as the quantity of the pleural effusion, requiring surgical drainage. We ruled out lung tuberculosis, but we identified positive IgM for both MP and CP. Based on these findings we changed the antibiotic therapy on Levofloxacin for 10 days with favorable evolution. MP and CP are two atypical pathogen that are difficult to be diagnosed due to their slow-growing pattern. Despite their self-limiting feature, the association between them might carry a vital risk in small children, especially in the lack of a proper and timely diagnosis."

Methods: We retrospectively retrieved data of inpatients with COVID-19 from January 21st to March 14th, 2020, and CAP from November 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2019 in Wuhan Children's Hospital. We divided CAP into mycoplasma pneumonia and other viral pneumonia. We analyzed clinical and radiological features from those patients, and compared the differences among COVID-19, mycoplasma pneumonia and other viral pneumonia. Results: Eighty COVID-19 inpatients from January 21st to March 14th, 2020, as well as 95 inpatients with mycoplasma pneumonia and 50 inpatients with other viral pneumonia from November 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2019 were included in our study. All patients were confirmed with RT-PCR. The clinical symptoms were similar in the three groups. Except fever and cough, diarrhea (6/80, 7.5%), tachypnea (2/80, 2.5%), and fatigue (6/80, 7.5%) were less common in COVID-19 patients. Compared to mycoplasma pneumonia and other viral pneumonia inpatients, COVID-19 patients present remarkably increased alanine aminotransferase (69/80, 86.3%). The typical CT feature of COVID-19 is ground-glass opacity, and it was more common in COVID-19 patients (32/80, 40%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 shared similar onsets with CAP. Even though the ground-glass opacity and elevated level of ALT were frequent in COVID-19, the better way for treatment and management of this disease is quickly and accurately identifying the pathogen."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma genitaliumcID:33268306TITLE:Rational stepwise approach for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children.ABSTRACT:Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen that causes community-acquired pneumonia. In the past, M. pneumoniae was sensitive to macrolide antibiotics, and M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) was usually a benign and self-limiting disease. However, despite use of the appropriate antibiotics, persistent fever and clinical deterioration may occur, leading to severe disease. Two major complicated conditions that may be clinically encountered are macrolide-resistant MPP and refractory MPP. Regarding the epidemics in Taiwan, before 2017, the mean rate of macrolide resistance was below 30%. Notably, since 2018, the prevalence of macrolide-resistant MPP in Taiwan has increased rapidly. Macrolide-resistant MPP shows persistent fever and/or no radiological regression to macrolide antibiotics and may even progress to severe and complicated pneumonia. Tetracyclines (doxycycline or minocycline) or fluoroquinolones are alternative treatments for macrolide-resistant MPP. Refractory MPP is characterized by an excessive immune response against the pathogen. In this context, corticosteroids have been suggested as an immunomodulator for downregulating the overactive host immune reaction. Overuse of macrolides may contribute to macrolide resistance, and thereafter, an increase in macrolide-resistant MPP. Delayed effective antimicrobial treatment is associated with prolonged and/or more severe disease. Thus, the appropriate prescription of antibiotics, as well as the rapid and accurate diagnosis of MPP, is important. The exact starting point, dose, and duration of the immunomodulator are yet to be established. We discuss these important issues in this review."

The purpose of this study was to investigate antibacterial drugs for treating CAP according to age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Japanese national database from 2011 to 2014, we analyzed the usage of antibiotics for CAP according to age. RESULTS: The numbers of claim information were 9,386, and 70% of the patients were aged >= 75 years. Sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) or ceftriaxone (CTRX) was used in 60%, but broad-spectrum antibiotics, combination therapy, and anti-mycoplasma antibiotics were used in 15 - 28% of all age groups. The 30-day survival rate did not differ between SBT/ABPC or CTRX vs. others. There was no difference in 30-day mortality and risk in any group between the ages of 15 and 64 years. On the other hand, the use of anti-mycoplasma antibiotics reduced the 30-day mortality by 0.50 times (p < 0.01), and the use of two or more antibiotics increased the 30-day mortality by 1.45 times (p = 0.02) at age >= 65 years. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the antibiotics used for CAP requiring hospitalization consisted of CTRX or SBT/ABPC as recommended by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) guidelines. On the other hand, the usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics and combination therapy were relatively frequent at all ages, although their use does not always contribute to survival.

It is mainly known for causing polyserositis and polyarthritis in weaned piglets, even though the mechanisms of systemic spread are not fully understood. Mycoplasma hyorhinis has also been associated with other diseases in pigs such as pneumonia or otitis media, but so far has not been known to cause central nervous disorders. This case series reports the isolation of Mycoplasma hyorhinis from cerebrospinal fluid and/ or meningeal swabs from piglets originating from four different piglet producing farms in Austria. CASE PRESENTATION: On farm 1, coughing, stiff movement and central nervous signs occurred in nursery piglets. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was the only pathogen isolated from meningeal swabs from two piglets showing central nervous signs. Fibrinopurulent leptomeningitis was only observed in one piglet. Only one of two nursery piglets from farm 2 showed mild central nervous signs but no histologic lesions; Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of the piglet with neurologic signs. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of all three investigated piglets from farm 3, all of which showed central nervous signs and purulent leptomeningitis. Further, Streptococcus suis was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of one piglet. Fibrinopurulent leptomeningitis was detected in two piglets from farm 4 that had died overnight without showing any clinical signs and Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from meningeal swabs from both piglets. CONCLUSION: While causality has yet to be proven by experimental infection and in situ detection of the pathogen in histologic sections, the findings of this study and the absence of other pathogens suggest Mycoplasma hyorhinis as a potential causative agent of meningitis in swine."

Physicians may overprescribe antimicrobials owing to the concern of bacterial infections, including those because of atypical pathogens. We investigated the accuracy of clinical predictions concerning atypical pathogen infections. Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented with a fever and cough in outpatient clinics between December 2016 and August 2018. After taking a history and performing physical examinations, physicians predicted the possibility of respiratory infections because of atypical pathogens. Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: >=50%, intermediate: 20% >= and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. Results: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3-39.2) were associated with the detections.

Our study aimed to identify the effects of low-dose corticosteroids on the recovery of children with MPP. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, pediatric inpatients with MPP were included from the Shanghai Children's Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia cohort study between August 2014 and July 2019. The multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to investigate the effects of low-dose corticosteroid treatment on fever duration after admission, total fever duration, length of hospital stay, C-reactive protein recovery time, and imaging recovery time with the stratification of severe pneumonia, refractory pneumonia, inflammatory biomarkers, pulmonary images, and timing of corticosteroids. Results: There were 548 patients in the corticosteroid group and 337 in the no-corticosteroid group. The corticosteroid group showed severe clinical parameters such as more severe and refractory cases, higher laboratory values, and more abnormal imaging manifestations. The corticosteroid group also showed longer fever duration after admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.1), P = 0.008], longer total fever duration [OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.3), P = 0.011], longer hospital stay [OR = 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9-4.0), P < 0.001], and longer C-reactive protein (CRP) recovery time [OR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9), P = 0.021] in the regression model after the adjustment for severity. Although low-dose corticosteroids were associated with shortened imaging recovery time in patients with high level laboratory values, pulmonary imaging could be completely recovered in both groups. The trend of these results was consistent even after stratifications and a propensity scores matching analysis. Conclusions: Low-dose corticosteroids may not be beneficial in children inpatients with MPP, and further studies on proper treatment modality are needed in the MRMP era."

Mycoplasma is an uncommon co-infected pathogen with SARS-CoV-2 and has not yet been reported. Computed tomography (CT), used as an accessory examination, may play a more significant role in this co-infection. CASE SUMMARY: A 49-year-old female presented with a cough, expectoration and chest congestion followed by elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. CT images showed ground-glass opacities in bilateral lower lobes and a patchy and striate shadow in the right upper lobe. Immunoglobulin M antibody of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was positive and real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of sputum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The diagnosis of CoVID-19 was made based on laboratory results, chest CT images, clinical manifestations and epidemiologic characteristics. She was treated with combination therapy for 17 d and showed a marked reCoVery. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycoplasma in CoVID-19 patients appears to be uncommon. CT is an acceptable method for the primary diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.

The demographic, clinical and laboratory data of the patients with CAP were analyzed. Univariate analyses identified predictors for MP infections. The discriminative power of C-reactive protein (CPR), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP/PCT and CPR/PCT >350 mug/ng was assessed by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A total of 552 CAP patients, including 247 (44.7%) with MP, 152 (27.6%) with SP and 153 (27.7%) with influenza A and B viruses, were enrolled. When comparing MP with SP, cough and CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng (odds ratio [OR]) 2.88, p < .001) were predictors for MP.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical data of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital of Zhuzhou City from January 28 to March 15, 2020, as well as laboratory test results for respiratory pathogens and biochemical indicators, were collected to conduct correlation analyses. All patients were diagnosed based on fluorescence-based PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Eleven of the 78 patients (14.1%) were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens, among which Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=5, 45.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (n=4, 36.4%) were the most frequent. There were 8 patients co-infected with 1 other pathogen and 3 patients co-infected with 2 other pathogens. Compared with mono-infected COVID-19 patients, patients with co-infections had significantly higher levels of procalcitonin (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS The findings showed that Mycoplasma pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common co-infections in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Increased levels of PCT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were associated with co-infection."

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

The health systems are facing significant challenges in carrying out the diagnosis and treatment of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children. Levofloxacin is suitable for treating infectious diseases in various systems but limited in children due to arthropathy issues in weight-bearing joints. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in children with macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled six confirmed cases of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia who were admitted in the paediatric respiratory ward of Shandong provincial hospital Affiliated to Shandong first Medical University between 1st January 2020 and 29th February 2020. Levofloxacin was given to the patients through the intravenous or oral route as per the following dosages :<5 years, 8-10 mg/kg q12 h; >5 years, 8-10 mg/kg, qd for 10 days. The clinical data were collected and analysed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The average age of the enrolled cases was six years and nine months (range, four years, and seven months to eleven years and seven months). All cases were found to be drug-resistant and were treated with azithromycin combined with antibacterial drugs. Levofloxacin was used in the patient's refractory to macrolide antibiotics. The temperature of five cases returned to normal 1-2 days after treatment with levofloxacin, and the imaging of the four cases showed expected improvements. The gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological manifestations, joint symptoms, blood parameters, liver and kidney functions, and exercise conditions of the children were closely monitored. The follow-up time of the patients ranged from one week to five months. No drug-related adverse reactions were observed in patients during treatment or during follow-up. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms and imaging significantly improved after treatment with levofloxacin, and no drug-related adverse reactions were observed. Levofloxacin proved to be an effective and safe drug in the treatment of children with macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumonia. This study will provide a reference for evaluating the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in the paediatric population."

METHOD: A total of 430 patients with MPP were enrolled between January 2015 and December 2015 and divided into a general MPP (GMPP) group (n = 306) and a RMPP group (n = 124). Clinical data, D-D level, white blood cell (WBC) count, proportion of neutrophils (N%), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of RMPP. RESULTS: (1) Hospitalization time, preadmission fever duration, total fever duration, WBC, N %, CRP, LDH, ESR, ALT, AST, and D-D were significantly higher in the RMPP group than those in the GMPP group (all P < 0.05). (2) Correlation analysis showed that D-D was positively correlated with WBC, CRP, ESR, and LDH, and could be used to jointly evaluate the severity of the disease. (3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified preadmission fever duration, CRP, LDH and DD as independent risk factors for RMPP (all P < 0. 05). D-D had the highest predictive power for RMPP (P < 0.01). The D-D level also had a good ability to predict pleural effusion and liver injury (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum D-D levels were significantly increased in patients with RMPP, indicating that excessive inflammatory response and vascular endothelial injury with prolonged duration existed in this patient population. Increased levels of serum D-D may be used as an early predictor of RMPP and the occurrence of complications. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the early diagnosis of RMPP, early intervention and excessive inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma."

Both infective agents are frequently detected in the above mentioned pathological processes as monoinfection or mixed infection. Mycoplasma antigens are capable of prolonged (up to 1 year) persistence in the patient body in spite of etiotropic therapy and the presence of specific antibodies. The method of the preliminary treatment of specimens for the polymerase chain reaction is proposed: the specimens are subjected to prolonged deproteinization, which makes it possible to detect M. pneumoniae in some cases of chronic infection when it cannot be detected by routine methods."

Radiographic and clinical findings in ACS resemble pneumonia; however, etiologies other than infectious pathogens have been implicated, including pulmonary fat embolism (PFE) and infarction of segments of the pulmonary vasculature. The National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group was designed to identify the etiologic agents and clinical outcomes associated with this syndrome. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the prospective study of 671 episodes of ACS in 538 patients with sickle cell anemia. ACS was defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate involving at least 1 complete segment of the lung, excluding atelectasis. In addition, the patients had to have chest pain, fever &gt;38.5C, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. Samples of blood and deep sputum were analyzed for evidence of bacteria, viruses, and PFE. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was determined by analysis of paired serologies. Detailed information on patient characteristics, presenting signs and symptoms, treatment, and clinical outcome were collected. RESULTS: Fifty-one (9%) of 598 episodes of ACS had serologic evidence of M pneumoniae infection. Twelve percent of the 112 episodes of ACS occurring in patients younger than 5 years were associated with M pneumoniae infection. At the time of diagnosis, 98% of all patients with M pneumoniae infection had fever, 78% had a cough, and 51% were tachypneic. More than 50% developed multilobar infiltrates and effusions, 82% were transfused, and 6% required assisted ventilation. The average hospital stay was 10 days. Evidence of PFE with M pneumoniae infection was seen in 5 (20%) of 25 patients with adequate deep respiratory samples for the PFE assay. M pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae was found in 16% of patients with diagnostic studies for C pneumoniae. Mycoplasma hominis was cultured in 10 (2%) of 555 episodes of ACS and occurred more frequently in older patients, but the presenting symptoms and clinical course was similar to those with M pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: M pneumoniae is commonly associated with the ACS in patients with sickle cell anemia and occurs in very young children. M hominis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ACS. Aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including 1 from the macrolide class, is recommended for all patients as well as bronchodilator therapy, early transfusion, and respiratory support when clinically indicated."

Five hundred and thirty one samples of pharingeal swabs were obtained from children with ARI. 74% were younger than one year old. Brochopneumonias constituted 66.39% of the cases. In total 357 agents were isolated 35% corresponding to bacteria in pure culture, 23.3% to mixed infections and 11.6% only viruses. The bacteria were: Haemphilus influenza (12.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Staphylococcus aureus (9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was identified in 5 children and M. hominis in 3. Adenoviruses were isolated in 98 patients, parainfluenza in 19, respiratory syncytial virus in 4, influenza in 1 and picornavirus in 2. Predominating socioeconomic factors were: overcrowding, deficient schooling and low income of parents which favor malnutrition. The more frequent agents were constitutes by bacteria. Viruses were a less cause of infection. It was confirmed that babies under 12 months are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia and prompt treatment with antimicrobial agents lowered the lethality. Low socioeconomic level is a possible predisposing factor for respiratory diseases."

However, it is an uncommon cause of respiratory infections in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective clinical investigation in a 21-bed ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Seven patients requiring intensive care who developed a ICU-acquired pneumonia in which M. hominis was recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural fluid cultures. INTERVENTIONS: M. hominis was isolated in all patients by use of conventional bacteriological cultures. All strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Patients' charts were reviewed for each case of infection. RESULTS: Seven strains of M. hominis were isolated during a 4-year period. All of these isolates were recovered from adult men admitted to the ICU and all had clinical signs of pneumonia. In three patients treatment for M. hominis with quinolones was associated with a good clinical response. CONCLUSION: Suspicion of M. hominis pneumonia must be heightened particularly in critically ill patients. Therefore an understanding of the microbiology of this organism is essential to successfully treat patients with these infections that are not ordinarily covered with standard antibiotic therapy."

The ability of Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis to cause pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis in newborns can no longer be questioned. The association of Ureaplasma spp. with bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been supported by the majority of observational studies, but proof of causality is still lacking. The availability of molecular diagnostic technologies has enabled the designation of the two Ureaplasma biovars as individual species, but additional work must be done to establish whether there is differential pathogenicity between the Ureaplasma spp. or among their respective serovars. Future investigations to prevent prematurity should be directed toward identification and localization of specific micro-organisms combined with targeted antibiotic trials to determine whether such interventions can improve long-term infant outcomes."

Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which causes upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, and other complications, is an uncommon isolate from the ororespiratory tract except during outbreaks of disease. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are the two principal species of genital mycoplasmas. These are responsible for some cases of urogenital infections, and more recent studies show that they are associated with perinatal disorders. Glycolipid antigens of M. pneumoniae dominated serologic studies of mycoplasmas until recently, when protein antigens were isolated. The latter isolations, the production of monoclonal antibodies to attachment proteins, and the demonstration of antibodies to these proteins will make it possible to identify specific pathogenic components involved in infection due to M. pneumoniae and will permit evaluation of the relative roles of the glycolipid and protein antigens. Serologic studies of the genital mycoplasmas have demonstrated seven serotypes of M. hominis and at least 16 serotypes of U. urealyticum, the latter falling into two large serogroups. Type-specific tissue invasion with genital mycoplasmas has been demonstrated, particularly in relation to perinatal morbidity. Surface antigens of genital mycoplasmas are in the early stages of definition and purification.

Data on Ureaplasma meningitis are limited and partly controversially discussed. PATIENT: We report the unique case of a 9-month-old infant with progressive internal hydrocephalus of unknown origin and developmental delay due to a history of&gt;200 days of inflammation of the central nervous system. The female extremely low birth weight infant had been referred to our hospital for ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. She had been born at 26+3 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 940 g. With the exception of a moderate respiratory distress syndrome, postnatal period had been reported uneventful. However, internal hydrocephalus had become manifest at 4 weeks of postnatal age. Intraventricular hemorrhage had not been documented by cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis had repetitively revealed pronounced inflammation reflected by pleocytosis (50-86 leukocytes/muL, 60% lymphocytes), CSF protein levels of 578-1,026 mg/dL and undetectable CSF glucose. Although suggesting bacterial meningitis, microbial diagnostics had not been indicative, and empirical antibiotics had not affected the CSF findings. On admission to our hospital, CSF analysis still documented significant inflammation (125 leukocytes/muL, CSF protein 565 mg/dL, CSF glucose&lt;2 mg/dL). RESULTS: Due to a prenatal history of cerclage, we initiated microbial diagnostics on Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis. U. parvum was detected in CSF by culture and PCR, no other pathogens were isolated. On intravenous treatment with chloramphenicol, CSF profile continuously normalized, and cultures and PCR became negative. Treatment was continued for 3 weeks, and the infant was discharged after uncomplicated ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. During a 12-month observation period she has shown encouraging recovery. CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, in particular, internal hydrocephalus of unknown origin and sustained CSF inflammation are highly suggestive of Ureaplasma meningitis. Our case highlights that infection may escape detection if not explicitly considered, since microbial diagnosis requires complex media and PCR."

Acute chorioamnionitis is an inflammation of the placenta associated with miscarriage. We retrospectively evaluated a possible association between genital mycoplasmas detection, acute chorioamnionitis and fetal pneumonia from second and third trimester spontaneous abortions. METHODS: One hundred and thirty placenta and fetal lung samples were evaluated for histological examination. The placenta samples, along with corresponding fetal tracheo-bronchial aspirates, also underwent bacterial and fungal culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of genital mycoplasmas. RESULTS: Acute chorioamnionitis and pneumonia were diagnosed in 80/130 (61.5%) and 22/130 (16.9%) samples, respectively. Among samples positive for acute chorioamnionitis, the proportion of samples positive by real-time PCR and/or culture, was significantly higher than that of negative controls [54/80 (67.5%) vs. 26/80 (32.5%); P&lt;0.001].

He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was found to have septic thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome), with blood cultures growing Fusobacterium necrophorum. While his antibiotics were narrowed to piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy, his clinical condition worsened, but repeated efforts to define an additional/alternative respiratory pathogen resulted in negative cultures. He eventually developed bilateral empyemas growing Mycoplasma hominis. Once azithromycin was added to the patient's regimen, he improved dramatically. Retrospective sequencing of consecutive endotracheal aspirates showed Fusobacterium as the dominant pathogen early in the course, but with significant and increasing Mycoplasma abundance several days prior to clinical detection. CONCLUSIONS Had sequencing information been available to the treating clinicians, the causative pathogens could have been detected earlier, guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy and perhaps preventing his clinical complications. Real-time bacterial DNA sequencing has the potential to shift the diagnostic paradigm in severe pneumonia."

The aim of our study was to (i) detect M. hominis in the vaginal and urine samples of sexually active women using three different detection methods and (ii) to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and recurrence after the treatment. METHODS: Both vaginal and urine samples were collected from 110 sexually active women at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, Baskent University Ankara Hospital, Turkey, between March 2015 and February 2016. The presence of M. hominis in the vaginal and urine samples was detected by in vitro culture, two biochemical diagnostics kits (Mycoplasma IES (Autobio, China) and Mycoplasma IST-2 (BioMerieux, France) and PCR. The antibiotic susceptibility of each sample was tested using the kits. The women positive for M. hominis were treated either singly or along with their sexual partners by tetracycline. RESULTS: M. hominis was detected in 72 of 220 (32.7%) samples (both vaginal and urine). Of which 37 showed contrary results with two different kits and then were confirmed by PCR. In 13 samples the IES kit identified M. hominis missed by IST-2, and in 8 samples the MIST-2 kit identified M. hominis missed by IES, while both kits missed 6 samples that were agar culture positive for M. hominis."" The highest susceptibility rate was observed against pristinamycin (100%), followed by 91%, 83%, and 75% for doxycycline, tetracycline, and josamycin, respectively. Twenty-five patients treated with tetracycline were followed after one month. The recurrence of M. hominis was not observed in any of the 18 cases where both sexual partners were treated but recurred in 5 of the 7 singly treated women. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of M. hominis detection was significantly higher in the vaginal samples compared to the urine samples. The probability of detecting M. hominis by IST-2 kit was 1.18 times less than IES kit (p &lt; 0.001). When the relationship between the samples was examined, the difference between IES and IST-2 for detecting M. hominis was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01). Antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the tetracycline group of antibiotics was effective in eliminating M. hominis when given to both the sexual partners."

Therefore, another antimicrobial regimen for non-chlamydial non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is required. Garenoxacin (GRNX) is a fluoroquinolone against respiratory infections, not against urethritis in Japan, but its in-vitro antimicrobial activity against MG is known as similar to or higher than that of moxifloxacin. To clarify the efficiency of GRNX against MG, we examined the clinical efficacy of GRNX for NGU. Seventy-nine male patients with NGU were enrolled and treated with GRNX once daily for 7 days. For assessing microbiological and clinical efficacies, the bacteria including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), MG, Mycoplasma hominis (MH), Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and Ureaplasma parvum (UP) were detected by means of nucleic acid amplification tests before- and after-treatment. After excluded 3 patients, seventy-six patients were evaluated: the median age; 31 (20-61) years, vaginal infection (66%); the most common infectious route and commercial sex worker (43%); the most common source. There were 50 bacteria-positive NGU cases, including 10 multiple bacterial infections. Clinical cure rate was 85.7% (36/42). Detection frequency of each bacterium was similar to the previous reported. The eradication rates of CT, MG, MH, UU and UP were 96.1%, 71.4%, 100%, 85.7% and 100%, respectively. These results indicate that GRNX has the excellent efficacies for NGU except those of MG. Further study of drug-resistant MG urethritis; for instance, studies on the clinical effectiveness of long-term such as 2-week medication of GRNX or the efficacy of alternative treatment regimens are necessary."

Bronchial dehiscence in the context of M. hominis infection has not been previously reported. In this report, we discuss a case of donor-derived M. hominis infection in a LTx recipient with bilateral bronchial anastomoses dehiscence and stenosis. The infection was managed using a multidisciplinary approach: repeat surgical revision of the necrotic anastomosis; targeted antibiotic therapy with the combination of oral and inhaled fluoroquinolones, and oral doxycycline and continuous ventilatory support. Response to therapy was monitored through repeat bronchoscopy and serial quantitative PCR assays for M. hominis in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and aspiration. The rare nature of M. hominis infection after LTx, its difficult detection in conventional cultures and innate resistance to beta-lactams make diagnosis and timely treatment of this organism challenging. We recommend that transplant centers have a low threshold for screening for Mycoplasma infection, particularly in patients with unsatisfactory postoperative course and little response to broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal coverage. Monitoring with PCR may help to adapt the duration of antibiotic therapy."

Genital mycoplasmas, Ureaplasma urealyticum or Mycoplasma hominis, were isolated from the placentas and the fetal tissues, and from the genital tracts of the mothers. Isolation of mycoplasmas from the liver indicated that bloodstream dissemination of these organisms occurred in the fetus. In the fetus, the pathologic changes were variable.

It can be recovered from the respiratory secretions of 1-3% of healthy persons and of less than or equal to 8% of persons with chronic respiratory disease, but it has not been implicated definitely in the etiology of this disease or in the exacerbations that characterize its course. M. hominis has been isolated from less than or equal to 6% of persons with acute pharyngitis or acute upper respiratory tract illnesses and can induce exudative pharyngitis in susceptible volunteers when administered intranasally and oropharyngeally. Colonization of the respiratory tract by M. hominis occurs in approximately 15% of persons who engage in oral-genital sexual practices, but colonization alone is not necessarily associated with sore throat or other upper respiratory diseases. Although M. hominis has been recovered from adults with pneumonia more often than from controls, a pathogenic role in pneumonia of adults has not been established. Under special conditions, e.g., neonatal pneumonia, M. hominis appears to be pathogenic for the lower respiratory tract. Thus M. hominis probably is only an occasional respiratory pathogen in the adult and a rare ""opportunistic"" pathogen of the respiratory tract of the neonate."

The etiological role of M. pneumoniae (as a monoantigen and in association with respiratory viruses) in acute respiratory infections and pneumonias has been established. M. pneumoniae also plays a certain role in the development of attacks of bronchial asthma and chronic recurrent pneumonias. M. hominis, being an urogenital mycoplasma, may also be the causative agent of acute respiratory infections and pneumonias. A high rate of infection of newborn babies with M. hominis and T-strains is noted. There is evidence indicating frequent and generalized mycoplasmal infection in infants in the perinatal period. In addition to changes in the lungs, mycoplasmal infection produces lesions in the heart, liver, kidneys, central nervous system and other organs, produces the development of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.

This prospective study was conducted to specify their role in these diseases. POPULATION AND METHODS--A pharyngeal or tracheal swab specimen for mycoplasmas culture was obtained from 100 infants admitted consecutively to the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU) during the first 24 hours of life. Mycoplasma culture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid was also performed. Pharyngeal and/or tracheal specimens were collected again on days 5, 15 and 28 if the child was still in the NCU. Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) were identified by culture in a modified Hayflick's medium. RESULTS--Three-hundred and ten pharyngeal or tracheal swabs were obtained (100 on day 0, 89 on day 5, 72 on day 15 and 49 on day 28). Twenty-one infants had one or more positive swabs in the first five days of life (20 on day 0 and one on day 5); those forming the ""Myco+"" group and the others forming the ""Myco-"" group. Uu was isolated alone from 20 infants, associated with Mh from one. Both groups were similar for gestational age, birth weight, maternal fever during labor, prolonged rupture of the fetal membranes or chorioamnionitis and for the incidence of acute respiratory distress. There was a statistically significant difference for the route of delivery (chi 2 &lt; 0.02). One blood culture (from 92 performed) was positive for Uu and another positive for Uu and Mh. Both children were cured without any specific mycoplasmacidal therapy. Three children had probable Uu infection and were also cured without specific therapy. CONCLUSIONS--A pharyngeal colonization with genital mycoplasmas is common in the first days of life (21%) but our data do not allow us to conclude that they are accountable for newborn infections."

METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T >= 37.5  C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1-June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7-8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks.

It is a human pathogen causing upper and lower respiratory infections, both in adults and children. However, it is also considered to be implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of extra-respiratory diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders. The liver involvement in children during or after M. pneumoniae infections is analyzed and discussed in this review. Through a systematic literature search, it is evidenced that M. pneumoniae is not infrequently associated with alteration of liver function, but rarely causes acute and severe hepatitis in children. M. pneumoniae should be considered among the unusual causes of acute hepatitis in children, whenever the most common hepatotropic viruses have been excluded. The pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae-related hepatitis is likely to be immune-mediated: both the innate and adaptive immune responses may play a fundamental role. However, the exact pathological mechanisms have to be elucidated yet. Further clinical studies are needed in order to understand the actual relevance of this microorganism in liver disease and its pathogenesis."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma pneumoniaeID:31738328TITLE:Meta-analysis of the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of High- and Low-dose Methylprednisolone in the Treatment of Children With Severe Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is generally a self-limiting disease, but it can develop into severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (SMPP). Immunologic mechanisms are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SMPP. Therefore, the use of systemic glucocorticoids may have beneficial effects. However, to date, the use of glucocorticoid therapy in SMPP is limited to small case series, and the glucocorticoid dosage for children with SMPP has not been established. METHODS: Here, we used a meta-analysis method to collect data from randomized control trials of different doses of methylprednisolone in SMPP to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with low- versus high-dose methylprednisolone in children with SMPP. RESULTS: We included 13 Chinese randomized control trials that included 1049 children. The high- and low-dose groups were comprised of 524 and 525 children, respectively. The high-dose group was significantly more effective than the low-dose group in clinical efficacy [risk ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.23, 1.38), P < 0.05]. In addition, compared with low-dose methylprednisolone, high-dose methylprednisolone significantly shortened hospital stays and antipyretic therapy, pulmonary rales disappearance, cough disappearance and pulmonary shadow absorption times. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the high- and low-dose groups: risk ratio= 0.85, 95% CI (0.53, 1.36), P > 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that high-dose methylprednisolone is effective in the treatment of SMPP without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions."

A 12-year-old boy was admitted to the paediatric emergency department for a left pleuropneumonia and a splenic infarction. aPT antibodies were transitorily detected. The patient recovered fully after antibiotic therapy and a 3-month course of anticoagulation treatment. Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies induced by acute infections have already been reported but cases of clinically relevant thrombosis remain rare. The pathogenicity of aPT antibodies is discussed here. We hypothesize that these antibodies were involved in this symptomatic hypercoagulable state.

This study applied high-throughput whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies to analyze the genomes of 30 M. pneumoniae strains isolated from children with pneumonia in South Korea during the two epidemics from 2010 to 2016 in comparison with a global collection of 48 M. pneumoniae strains which includes seven countries ranging from 1944 to 2017. RESULTS: The 30 Korean strains had approximately 40% GC content and ranged from 815,686 to 818,669 base pairs, coding for a total of 809 to 828 genes. Overall, BRIG revealed 99% to > 99% similarity among strains. The genomic similarity dropped to approximately 95% in the P1 type 2 strains when aligned to the reference M129 genome, which corresponded to the region of the p1 gene. MAUVE detected four subtype-specific insertions (three in P1 type 1 and one in P1 type 2), of which were all hypothetical proteins except one tRNA insertion in all P1 type 1 strains. The phylogenetic associations of 30 strains were generally consistent with the multilocus sequence typing results. The phylogenetic tree constructed with 78 genomes including 30 genomes from Korea formed two clusters and further divided into two sub-clusters. eBURST analysis revealed two clonal complexes according to P1 typing results showing higher diversity among P1 type 2 strains. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative whole genome approach was able to define high genetic identity, unique structural diversity, and phylogenetic associations among the 78 M. pneumoniae strains isolated worldwide."

However the duration of MP infection in lower airway and the course of anti-MP treatment remains unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 94 MPP children. Patients were classified into two groups. The long-term group (Group LT) was defined as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) remained MP-positive by PCR after 30 days of the disease course. The non-long-term group (Group NLT) was defined as BALF became MP-negative by PCR within 30 days of disease and patients who only needed one bronchoscopy lavage therapy. MP loads, clinical outcomes were analyzed along with other clinical measurements. RESULTS: The average levels of inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase in Group LT were significantly higher than those in Group NLT. Airway and lung damage in Group LT were more severe than Group NLT. 28 patients developed necrotizing pneumonia and 8 patients developed pulmonary embolism in Group LT. Mean maximum MP loads in BALF were 107.46 +- 0.93 and 104.86 +- 0.93 in Groups LT and NLT, respectively. There was persistent MP DNA in Group LT, even lasted for 120 days. One severe MPP patient in Group LT had MP-associated bloodstream infection. After 3 months of follow-up, chest imaging revealed incomplete absorption of pulmonary consolidation in 33 patients of Group LT [including 13 airway obliterans (AO) patients] and in 7 patients of Group NLT (including 2 AO patients). CONCLUSION: MP loads of BALF were associated with the subsequent duration of MP DNA in lower airway. High MP loads and persistent long-term MP DNA in lower airway were associated with severity of pediatric MPP."

However, its mechanism of pathogenesis is not fully understood, and microRNAs might play a role. This study aimed to explore the microRNA-222-3p (miR-222-3p) expression and its possible role in children with M.pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP). METHODS: Thirty-six children with MPP and twenty-seven age-matched controls from Children's Hospital of Soochow University were enrolled in this study. MiR-222-3p and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) mRNA were detected using real-time PCR in children's peripheral blood plasma samples. THP-1 cells and mice were stimulated with M.pneumoniae lipid-associated membrane proteins(LAMPs). RESULTS: Children with MPP had significantly higher levels of miR-222-3p and lower levels of CD4 in peripheral blood plasma (P &lt;  0.05). Additionally, Sixteen children with MPP complicated with pleural effusion had higher miR-222-3p levels than those without pleural effusion. MiR-222-3p or CD4 in THP-1 cells increased or decreased, respectively, in a dose dependent manner after LAMP stimulation. In LAMP-stimulated mice massive inflammatory cells infiltrates surrounded the bronchioles, and miR-222-3p increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In conclusion, miR-222-3p was highly expressed in children with MPP, especially those with pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Small sample studies showed that M.pneumoniae or its LAMPs could increase miR-222-3p and decrease CD4 in macrophages,both in vitro and vivo.Thus, miR-222-3p might be an MPP biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis."

Objective: To examine the frequency and clinical presentation of M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using improved diagnostics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, longitudinal cohort study included 152 children aged 3 to 18 years with CAP enrolled in a CAP study from May 1, 2016, to April 30, 2017, at the University Children's Hospital Zurich. Children were inpatients or outpatients with clinically defined CAP according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines. Data analysis was performed from July 10, 2017, to June 29, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency and clinical presentation of M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease in childhood CAP. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of oropharyngeal samples and confirmed with the measurement of specific peripheral blood IgM antibody-secreting cells by enzyme-linked immunospot assay to differentiate M pneumoniae-infected patients from carriers with CAP caused by other pathogens. Mucocutaneous disease was defined as any eruptive lesion that involved skin and/or mucous membranes occurring during the CAP episode. Results: Among 152 enrolled children with CAP (median [interquartile range] age, 5.7 [4.3-8.9] years; 84 [55.3%] male), 44 (28.9%) tested positive for M pneumoniae by PCR; of these, 10 children (22.7%) developed mucocutaneous lesions. All 10 patients with mucocutaneous eruptions tested positive for specific IgM antibody-secreting cells. Skin manifestations were found in 3 cases (2.8%) of M pneumoniae PCR-negative CAP (P &lt; .001). The spectrum of M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease included M pneumoniae-induced rash and mucositis (3 cases [6.8%]), urticaria (2 cases [4.5%]), and maculopapular skin eruptions (5 cases [11.4%]). Two patients had ocular involvement as the sole mucosal manifestation (bilateral anterior uveitis and nonpurulent conjunctivitis). Patients with M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease had longer duration of prodromal fever (median [interquartile range], 10.5 [8.3-11.8] vs 7.0 [5.5-9.5] days; P = .02) and higher C-reactive protein levels (median [interquartile range], 31 [22-59] vs 16 [7-23] mg/L; P = .04) than patients with CAP due to M pneumoniae without mucocutaneous manifestations. They were also more likely to require oxygen (5 [50%] vs 1 [5%]; P = .007), to require hospitalization (7 [70%] vs 4 [19%]; P = .01), and to develop long-term sequelae (3 [30%] vs 0; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: Mucocutaneous disease occurred significantly more frequently in children with CAP due to M pneumoniae than in children with CAP of other origins. Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease was associated with increased systemic inflammation, morbidity, and a higher risk of long-term sequelae."

This study is a nationwide population-based cohort study from 1997 to 2013, which investigated the association between MP infection and urticaria in Taiwan. A total of 1,175 patients were included for the study group, and 2,350 for the control group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for urticaria. Result showed that 254 patients with new-onset urticaria were involved in the study group and 465 incident cases in the control group. The incidence rates (per 100,000 person-months) of urticaria were 37.2 and 32.5 in the study and control groups, respectively. The relative risk is 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0-1.3) indicating no significant correlation between MP and urticaria. The multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of urticaria with MP infection (aHR = 1.1, P = 0.1058) had no statistically significance difference compared to the control group. However, the risk of urticaria in MP-infected patients aged between 20 and 59 years old was found to have increased (aHR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2) prior to a diagnosis."

METHODS: All patients satisfied refractory MP pneumonia (RMPP) diagnostic criteria were enrolled. The clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, imaging features, treatments, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Six patients with an average age of 7.83+-3.13 years old were included in this study. All the patients were non-responsive to macrolide (ML) and glucocorticoids treatment shown by aggravated clinical symptoms and chest radiographies. The average total duration of fever was 19.5+-8.34 days and the average time before levofloxacin (LVX) therapy was 10+-2.97 days. After LVX treatment, the time of fever was from 1 to 3 days in five cases and 11 days in one case. The MP-DNA copies in the sputum decreased slowly after ML treatment in six patients, while they decreased quickly after LVX treatment in 5 children. A2063G mutation of domain V of 23SrRNA gene was found in five cases. Five patients recovered completely 16-32 days after treatment. One patient developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging and occurred serious sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The sputum MP-DNA copies and clinical symptoms have a positive correlation with therapeutic efficacy. LVX may be beneficial in treatment of ML-unresponsive and corticosteroid-resistant RMPP in children. RMPP can be gradually cured by effective treatment of LVX, while which can damage the nervous system and lead to severe complications once MP invades brain tissues."

Physical examination found decreased breath sound in 2 cases, phlegm rale in 3, and pleural friction rub in one. Pleural effusion was found in 5 cases by ultrasound. Plasma D-dimer increased in 6 cases (0.66-9.96 mg/L) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein elevated in 5 cases (10.78-78.00 mg/L). Chest enhanced CT showed pulmonary artery or venous filling defects, including pulmonary artery embolism in 7 cases and pulmonary vein embolism in one. The primary disease of these patients included Mycoplasma Pneumoniae pneumonia in 4 cases, nephritis in 2 and postoperative congenital heart disease in 2. Apart from one case who withdrew the treatment and was discharged, the other 7 patients received anticoagulant treatment had good outcome. Conclusions: For children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, immune disorders, long-term hormone therapy, cardiovascular invasive operation or other high-risk factors, PTE should be considered when fever, cough aggravation, short of breath, chest and back pain with pleural effusion are present. Chest enhanced CT scan should be performed as soon as possible, and anticoagulation should be started once the diagnosis is confirmed."

However, the lack of diagnostic criteria for quantitative ELISA M. pneumoniae-IgG (MP-IgG) and the low positive rates of ELISA M. pneumoniae-IgM (MP-IgM) limit the diagnostic value of ELISA for M. pneumoniae infection in adults. Here, the diagnostic value of quantitative ELISA MP-IgG was evaluated in adults with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP). The serum M. pneumoniae antibodies were detected in 162 patients with MPP, 228 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with non-Mycoplasma pneumoniae (NMP), and 162 healthy controls by ELISA, using the PA results as the reference standards. For the MP-IgM-/IgG+ subgroup, a single serum MP-IgG level of >=92.67 RU/mL can be used as a reference criterion for the diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection. At admission, for patients with CAP, the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA MP-IgM positivity for MPP were 18.51% and 99.56%, respectively. MP-IgM positivity combined with MP-IgG >= 92.67 RU/mL increased the sensitivity to 40.12% and decreased the specificity to 94.29%. For paired serum samples obtained within seven days, an ELISA MP-IgG concentration change of >=1.48-fold and MP-IgG >= 92.67 RU/mL on day 7 were used as the diagnostic criteria for M. pneumoniae infection.

The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and long-term prognosis of MPP-associated thrombosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 43 children with MPP-associated thrombosis between January 2013 and June 2019 at Beijing Children's Hospital. The results of blood coagulation studies, autoimmune antibody, thrombophilia screening, contrast-enhanced lung computed tomography, echocardiography, and blood vessel ultrasonography were analyzed, as were treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were diagnosed with SMPP. D-dimer was higher than 5.0 mg/L in 58.1% (25/43) of patients. The mean D-dimer level was 11.1 +- 12.4 mg/L. Anticardiolipin-IgM was positive in 60.0% of patients, beta2-glycoprotein-IgM in 64.0%, and lupus anticoagulant in 42.1%. Chest imaging revealed pulmonary consolidation with lobe distribution in all patients (2/3-1 lobe in 10 patients, > 1 lobe in 29 patients). In our experience, thrombosis can occur in a vessel of any part of the body, and it can be initially detected as late as 31 days after disease onset. Thrombosis in the brain and abdomen can occur early, at 5 days after disease onset. Pulmonary vessels were the most commonly involved sites in the current study, and accordingly chest pain was the most common symptom (32.6%), followed by neurological symptoms (14.0%) and abdominal pain (9.3%). Thirty-five percent of patients were asymptomatic with regard to thrombosis. All patients underwent anticoagulant therapy, and thrombus absorption took > 3 months in most patients. All patients were followed until October 2019, at which time 41 were asymptomatic and 2 had mild recurrent cough. CONCLUSIONS: SMPP with pulmonary consolidation (> 2/3 lobe) was the most strongly associated risk factor for thrombosis. Thrombosis-associated symptoms may be subtle, even absent. Elevated D-dimer, specifically > 11.1 mg/L (even > 5.0 mg/L), would assist in the early diagnosis of thrombosis. The long-term prognosis of thrombosis was good after timely administration of anticoagulant therapy."

An early and rapid diagnostic method is key for guiding clinicians in their choice of antibiotics. METHODS: The recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay is a recently developed, rapid detection method that has been used for the detection of several pathogens. The assays were performed in a one-step single tube reaction at 39  Celsius within 15-30 min. In this study, we established an RAA assay for M. pneumoniae using clinical specimens for validation and commercial real-time PCR as the reference method. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity of the RAA assay was 2.23 copies per reaction, and no cross-reactions with any of the other 15 related respiratory bacterial pathogens were observed. Compared with the commercial real-time PCR assay used when testing 311 respiratory specimens, the RAA assay obtained 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a kappa value of 1. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the proposed RAA assay will be of benefit as a faster, sensitive, and specific alternative tool for the detection of M. pneumoniae."

METHODS: A total of 73 children with RMPP and 146 children with general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were included. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were obtained. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to determine optimal predictors. The nomogram was plotted by multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. RESULTS: The LASSO regression analysis identified lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, neutrophil ratio, and high fever as significant predictors of RMPP. This nomogram-illustrated model showed good discrimination, calibration, and clinical value. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.884 (95% CI, 0.823-0.945) in the training set and 0.881 (95% CI, 0.807-0.955) in the validating set.

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0-18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children &lt; 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2-18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health."

METHODS: Propensity score matching was used to select 73 children with RMPP (refractory group) and 146 children with non-refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (common group). The logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic spline model, and decision curve analysis were used to analyze the clinical value of LDH in predicting RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the incidence of high fever, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of neutrophils, and serum levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, hemoglobin, albumin, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and LDH (P&lt;0.05). There were also significant differences between the two groups in the Mycoplasma pneumoniae-DNA load in nasopharyngeal aspirates and the incidences of pleural effusion, pulmonary consolidation, atelectasis, shortness of breath and skin lesions (P&lt;0.05).

METHODS: A total of 196 hospitalized children (at age of 0-36 months) who were diagnosed with MPP from January 2014 to June 2018 were enrolled as study subjects. A total of 208 children (at age of 0-36 months) with pneumonia not caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection during the same period of time were enrolled as controls (non-MPP group). A retrospective analysis was performed for their clinical data. The two groups were compared in the pulmonary function on the next day after admission and on the day of discharge. The children with MPP were followed up to observe pulmonary function at weeks 2 and 4 after discharge. RESULTS: Compared with the non-MPP group, the MPP group had significant reductions in the ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory time (TPTEF/TE), ratio of volume to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory volume (VPTEF/VE), inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio, and tidal expiratory flow at 25% remaining expiration on the next day after admission and on the day of discharge (P&lt;0.05). In addition there were significant increases in the ratio of peak tidal expiratory flow to tidal expiratory flow at 25% remaining expiration, respiratory rate, effective airway resistance, and plethysmographic functional residual capacity per kilogram (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the normal reference values of pulmonary function parameters, both groups had reductions in VPTEF/VE and TPTEF/TE on the next day after admission; on the day of discharge, the MPP group still had reductions in VPTEF/VE and TPTEF/TE, while the non-MPP group had normal values. The MPP group had increases in VPTEF/VE and TPTEF/TE from the day of discharge to weeks 2 and 4 after discharge (P&lt;0.05), but TPTEF/TE still did not reach the normal value at week 4 after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Airway obstruction is observed in infants and young children with acute MPP or non-MPP, and the children with MPP have a higher severity of airway obstruction and a longer time for improvement, with a certain degree of airway limitation in the recovery stage."

The pathogens of the disease may change for the misuse of antibiotics and the application of vaccines. Therefore, pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics may have changed. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics. METHOD: The current study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pathogens positive in children with S/L-PP under 14 years old at a single hospital between 1st Jan 2014 and 31st Dec 2018 retrospectively. The pathogens were detected by microbial cultivation, indirect immunofluorescence of the kit (PNEUMOSLIDE IgM), Elisa, and/or real-time PCR in the samples of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 593 children with S/L-PP received treatment at a single hospital during the study period by inclusion criteria. Four hundred fifty-one patients were single positive for one pathogen and 83 patients were positive for at least 2 pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) (72.34%) was the most commonly detected pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae) (8.77%). The prevalence of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time (p < 0.05). The positive rate of M.pneumoniae increased with ages of patients (p < 0.05). M.pneumoniae was statistically associated with the extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was statistically associated with abnormal white blood cells (WBCs) and C reactive proteins (CRPs) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M.pneumoniae was the most positive pathogen in children with S/L-PP. The positive rate of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time and the ages of children. M.pneumoniae was associated with extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was associated with abnormal WBCs and CRPs."

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with serologically-confirmed MPP or culture-confirmed other bacterial pneumonia (OBP). The distribution of affected areas, abnormalities in lateral bronchial lesions, the degree of air bronchogram, and previously reported findings on HRCT were evaluated for MPP and OBP. Predictive HRCT findings for MPP were determined by logistic regression analysis. We provisionally designed our HRCT criteria (negative, probable, or highly suspected) for diagnosing MPP and investigated the diagnostic yield of the HRCT criteria. RESULTS: Sixty-three MPP and 126 OBP patients were included in this study. Logistic regression analysis showed that the absence of peripheral predominance, bronchial wall thickening, lateral bronchial wall thickening, intralobular or lobular ground-glass opacities, intralobular ground-glass opacities connected to a lateral bronchus, and less air bronchogram in infiltrates were significant predictors of MPP. Our HRCT criteria showed that the sensitivity and specificity in negative, probable, and highly suspected MPP were 0.0 and 0.33, 1.0 and 0.69, and 0.5 and 0.98, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HRCT had considerable ability to detect a lateral bronchial abnormality and to diagnose or rule out MPP based on the distribution of affected areas, abnormalities in lateral bronchial lesions, and the degree of air bronchogram in the infiltrates."

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests. Our patient showed remarkable clinical and laboratory improvement with the therapy mentioned above."

Bacterial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional methods. This study assessed the clinical factors influencing bacterial mPCR results in patients with COP. Patients with COP admitted to a tertiary care hospital between November 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively assessed. Conventional methods included culture-based methods and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial mPCR that could identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia was performed. Bacterial mPCR was performed in a total of 342 patients with COP in the study. Bacterial mPCR alone provided etiology in 99 patients. The total etiologic diagnosis rates improved from 22.2 to 51.1% when bacterial mPCR was added to conventional methods. Additional diagnostic benefits of bacterial mPCR were more prominent in the prior antibiotic non-exposure group (77.8% vs 63.5%, P = 0.015) and in the low-risk group with low CURB 65 score (62.6% vs 44.9%, P = 0.005). Patients who required ICU care, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and patients with any underlying diseases were not associated with the additional pathogen detection rates using bacterial mPCR. By supplementing conventional diagnostic methods with bacterial mPCR-based methods, the overall pathogen detection rates improved in patients with COP. Moreover, the additional diagnostic usefulness of bacterial mPCR was significantly higher in patients without prior antibiotic exposure and in the mild-to-moderate-risk group with lower CURB 65 score."

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of viral and intracellular respiratory pathogens in children with SCD presenting with fever and/or ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, prospective, single-centre cohort study with nested case-control analysis was conducted on children with SCD admitted from October 2016 to October 2017 for fever and/or ACS to the paediatric department of Robert Debre university hospital, Paris, France. They were screened for 20 respiratory pathogens by a multiplex PCR in the nasopharynx (FilmArray). RESULTS: We included 101 children. M/F sex ratio of 0.45. The median age was 3.2 years (IQR: 1.4-8.2). At least one pathogen was isolated in 67 patients (67%). The most frequent viruses were as follows: rhinovirus (n=33), adenovirus (n=14), respiratory syncytial virus (n=13) and parainfluenza viruses (n=11). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in one case. Twenty-three (23%) presented with or developed ACS. A nested case-control analysis was performed, after pairing ACS with non-ACS children for age and inclusion period. There was no statistical association between any viral detection or multiple viral infection, and ACS (p=0.51) even though parainfluenza viruses were twice as common in ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Viral detection in febrile children with SCD is frequent, but its association with ACS was not demonstrated. In this study, M. pneumoniae was rare in young children with SCD experiencing ACS."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission revealed lesions of the corpus callosum and brain white matter. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer) on day 7 shows hypoperfusion (with right dominance) of bilateral upper parietal region. His condition improved gradually with symptomatic treatments alone, and he was discharged on day 13. The lesions on the MRI disappeared by day 15. Although this case might have suffered from leukoencephalopathy, clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) type II was suspected from the reversible splenial lesion. Except for the elevation (640 times) of mycoplasma pneumonia antibody titer (particle agglutination) in the serum, the blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid findings showed no significant abnormalities. We then considered this encephalopathy was related to mycoplasma pneumonia infection. Since no symptoms of mycoplasma infection except for neurologic symptoms were observed, indirect mechanism, such as immune-mediated reactions, is suggested to cause encephalopathy in this case."

Although single MP infection is common enough, MP and EBV coinfection have received little attention. Especially, the pathogenic role of EBV in lung when coinfection with MP, has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of EBV on MP pneumonia (MPP) in hospitalized children. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of MPP children who underwent screening for EBV by polymerase chain reaction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during hospitalization in 2014. Of total 147 patients, 68 patients were in the MP group and 79 were in the MP/EBV coinfection group. We found longer fever duration and higher CRP, IgA, IgG, interleukin-2 (IL-2), percentage of peripheral neutrophils levels, higher incidence of pulmonary consolidation and percentage of refractory MPP in coinfection group, when compared to those in MP group. In ROC curve analysis, IL-2 was useful for differentiating patients with coinfection from those with MP infection. Logistic regression analysis showed that the IL-2 >= 3.35 pg/ml (OR = 3.677) was a significant predictor regarding to MP/EBV coinfection. In conclusion, coinfection of EBV and MP poses a higher risk for prolonged symptoms. IL-2 could be used as a good predictor of coinfection."

They were divided into two groups based on MP infection: MP infection group (n = 97) and non-MP infection group (n = 113). We compared the variables of these two groups based on medical records.The MP infection group had higher ESR than the non-MP infection group. During hospitalization, the non-MP infection group had higher levels of WBC during hospital, LDH, PCT, and lower HB when compared to the MP infection group. No differences were found in the hs-CRP level, N%, PLT, ALT, CKMB, and cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) between MP and non-MP infection group. Likewise, no difference was found in fever duration or hospital stays between them. Totally 19 patients in the infection group had CAA with a rate of 19.59%; and 27 (23.89%) patients had CAA in the non-MP infection group. Unfortunately, no difference was found in CAA rate between the two groups.MP infection may occur simultaneously in children with Kawasaki disease. KD patients with MP infection tended to occur in older population. MP infection may not increase the risk of CAA, which still needs further large-scaled studies to confirm. Clinicians should be alert to KD patients with high level of ESR. MP should be screened and early treatment with macrolides should be given timely."

All people including children are generally susceptible to COVID-19, but the condition is relatively mild for children. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples. The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management. The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic. For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation."

Methods: Four hundred and fifty-four (male 210, female 244) children with pneumonia in Department of Pulmonology, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were enrolled from July, 2018 to October, 2018. Pharyngeal swabs and venous blood were obtained on the first or the second day after hospitalization. Fluorescence detection quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA, MP culture and MP-IgM were used to detect MP simultaneously. MP infection is diagnosed if MP culture is positive or the two of the other three methods are positive. Pharyngeal swabs were acquired and detected using fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA and MP culture again for children with confirmed MP infection before discharge. The detection rates and quantitative changes of the three methods were compared, and chi(2) test was used for comparison among groups. Results: A total of 454 hospitalized children with pneumonia were included in this study. The detection rates of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA, thermostatic amplification of RNA, MP culture and MP-IgM IgM were 43.6% (198/454), 43.2% (196/454), 40.0% (180/454) and 30.6% (139/454) respectively. The difference of detection rates of the four methods was statistically significant (chi(2)=20.8, P<0.05),but no significant difference between the detection rates of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA and thermostatic amplification of RNA was found (chi(2)=0.018, P=0.900). They both had higher detection rates than MP-IgM or MP culture. MP infection is diagnosed if MP culture is positive or the two of the other three methods are positive, and two hundred and nine children were diagnosed as MP infection. In the second test of MP infection in 209 children before discharge, the positive rate of MP culture was 67.5% (141/209), with 39.4% (13/33) changed from negative to positive, and 27.3% (48/176) changed from positive to negative. The positive rate of thermostatic amplification of RNA was 82.3% (172/209), with 16.2% (31/191) turned from positive to negative, and 66.7% (12/18) turned from negative to positive. The positive rate of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA was 67.0% (140/209), with 52.9% (18/34) cases changed from negative to positive, and 30.3% (53/175) cases changed from positive to negative. MP-DNA load decreased in 141 cases (67.5%) and increased in 68 cases (32.5%) in the second test among the positive samples tested by fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA. The detection rates of the four methods in the non-severe group and the severe group were similar, and the differences among the groups were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). In the second test, the proportion of changing from negative to positive in the severe group was higher than that in the non-severe group, but only the difference in the thermostatic amplification of RNA was statistically significant (P=0.038) and the cases of changing from negative to positive of thermostatic amplification of RNA in the severe group and non-severe group are 7 and 5 respectively. Conclusions: The methods of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid detection have high sensitivity and application value in the etiological diagnosis of acute MP infection in children. The results of fluorescence quantitative amplification of DNA and thermostatic amplification of RNA are highly consistent, and they are both more advantageous than MP-IgM. Repeated testing in the acute phase is helpful to find MP infection children whose first test is negative. The load of MP-DNA did not decrease in some children in the acute stage after antibiotic treatment."

Establishing an early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may have important therapeutic implications. METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS in a case series of adults and youth hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort study in two university teaching hospitals, from November 2017 to October 2019. RESULTS: In all 10 patients, early and rapid diagnosis for severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS was achieved with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. The average PaO2/FiO2 of all patients was 180 mmHg. Of the 10 cases, 4 cases had moderate ARDS (100 mmHg <= PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg) and 3 cases had severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was applied in all patients, though only two patients were sufficiently supported with HFNC. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was required in 5 patients. High resistance (median 15 L/cmH2O/s) and low compliance (median 38 ml/cmH2O) was observed in 4 cases. In these 4 cases, recruitment maneuvers (RM) were applied, with 1 patient demonstrating no response to RM. Prone positioning were applied in 4 cases. Two cases needed ECMO support with median support duration of 5.5 days. No patient in our case series received corticosteroid therapy. All patients were survived and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Early and rapid diagnosis of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS can be achieved with PCR/mNGS tests in samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. In our case series, half of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS cases were adequately supported with HFNC or NIV, while half of cases required intubation. RM and prone position were effective in 30% of intubated cases, and 20% needed ECMO support. When early anti-mycoplasmal antibiotics were given together with sufficient respiratory support, the survival rate was high with no need for corticosteroid use."

Two researchers independently performed literature screening, data extraction, and literature risk bias, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs were included, including 1130 patients. Meta-analysis showed that AZI combined with GC therapy significantly improved the total effective rate of the disease compared with the conventional treatment group (odds ratio [OR] = 6.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.03, 10.07; P < .00001; I = 0%), effectively shortened the antipyretic time (SMD = -2.29; 95% CI -2.70, -1.88; P < .0001); promoted lung inflammation absorption (SMD = -1.89; 95% CI -2.38, -1.40; P < .0001), reduced cough time (SMD = -2.39; 95% CI -2.80, -1.99; P < .0001); shortened hospital stay (SMD = -2.19; 95% CI -3.21, -1.17; P < .0001); improved imaging findings (OR = 5.38; 95% CI 1.09, 26.51, P = .04); reduced inflammation index (SMD = -3.15; 95% CI -4.93, -1.36; P = .004); improved immune function (SMD = 1.29; 95% CI -0.02, 2.60; P < .0001); had no significant adverse reactions (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.71, 1.98; P = .53).

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

We analyzed the clinical characteristics and the risk factors for NP caused by MP. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in 37 patients with NP caused by MP (NP group) and 74 patients diagnosed with lobar M. pneumoniae pneumonia with no necrosis (control group) who were admitted to our hospital between January 2013 and December 2017. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data, imaging findings, treatments and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of females, the incidence of pleural effusion, fever duration, hospitalization days, white blood cell count, neutrophil ratio, D-dimer level and use of other types of antibiotics were higher in the NP group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The control group exhibited a greater use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) than the NP group (P < 0.05). According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a white blood cell count > 12.3 x 109/L (Odds ratio, OR = 6.412), a neutrophil ratio > 73.9% (OR = 6.081) and D-dimer level > 1367.5 ng/mL (OR = 8.501) were risk factors for pulmonary necrosis caused by MP. Furthermore, the use of LMWH (OR = 0.074) reduced the risk of pulmonary necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: NP is a rare complication of severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (SMPP), and although the clinical course is longer than common MP infection, the necrotic area is absorbed gradually. In patients with SMPP presenting with lobar consolidation, a white blood cell count > 12.3 x 109/L, a neutrophil ratio > 73.9% and D-dimer level > 1367.5 ng/mL are risk factors for pulmonary necrosis, and the use of LMWH reduces the risk of pulmonary necrosis."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma pneumoniaeID:32497137TITLE:Clinical diagnostic application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Pneumonia is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children's Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma pneumoniaeID:32517424TITLE:Current perspectives on atypical pneumonia in children.ABSTRACT:The major pathogens that cause atypical pneumonia are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae is common in children and presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting disease. CAP due to L. pneumophila is very rare in children and progresses rapidly, with fatal outcomes if not treated early. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila have no cell walls; therefore, they do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics. Accordingly, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are the treatments of choice for atypical pneumonia. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics used in children because of their low minimum inhibitory concentrations and high safety. The incidence of pneumonia caused by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae that harbors point mutations has been increasing since 2000, particularly in Korea, Japan, and China. The marked increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MRMP) is partly attributed to the excessive use of macrolides. MRMP does not always lead to clinical nonresponsiveness to macrolides. Furthermore, severe complicated MRMP responds to corticosteroids without requiring a change in antibiotic. This implies that the hyper-inflammatory status of the host can induce clinically refractory pneumonia regardless of mutation. Empirical macrolide therapy in children with mild to moderate CAP, particularly during periods without M. pneumoniae epidemics, may not provide additional benefits over beta-lactam monotherapy and can increase the risk of MRMP."

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out with samples from 685 adults who were admitted with CAP and 108 non-CAP control patients. Atypical pathogens and respiratory viruses in serum were detected using the Pneumoslide IgM test from Vircell, Spain. All patients were divided into 6 groups according to age: 18-24, 25-44, 45-59, 60-74, 75-89, and >90. RESULTS: The total positive rate of CAP was 35.4%, which was highest in the 18-24 age group (P < .05). The highest positive rate, 17.11%, was observed for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The mean age of MP-infected patients was higher than that of the controls (P < .05). The positive rates for influenza B (INFB), Legionella pneumophila (LP1), Coxiella burnetii (COX), influenza A (INFA), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), and adenovirus (ADV) were 5.56%, 3.07%, 2.63%, 2.34%, 1.90%, 1.61, 0.88%, and 0.29%, respectively. There were 4.37% of patients with CAP having multiple infections. The main symptoms observed in the 685 CAP patients were cough and sputum production, in 78.4% and 67.4%. Fever was followed by 54% of CAP patients. Dyspnea (39.1%), anorexia (36.8%), increased thirst (26.7%), chills (18.7), headache (14.6%), and nausea (13.1%) were also frequently observed in the CAP patients. CONCLUSIONS: MP infection was the most common in adult CAP patients in Guangzhou City with the highest positive rate in the 18-24 age groups."

At present, the role of atypical pathogens in CAP arouses peoples' concern. Previous studies indicated that MP was the dominant pathogen of CAP, but the associated factors of MP infection were rarely reported. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the distribution of atypical pathogens related with CAP and compared their differences among various populations. Furthermore, we accessed the associated factors of MP infection in various population. RESULTS: A total of 3,675 patients were enrolled and divided into three groups. One thousand and eighty-nine subjects (29.6%) were infected with at least one atypical pathogen. MP was the most predominant pathogen in these CAP patients. Our study found that infection rates of the atypical pathogens were significantly different among three groups. Our results also revealed, in a pediatric group, as the temperature increased, so did the infection rate of MP, while it was the opposite in adult and elderly groups. Furthermore, in preschool and school-age children, high temperature, female, PIVs, ADV, and INFB infection were independent risk factors for MP infection, INFA infection was a protection factor for MP infection. However, in adult and elderly groups, the associated factors might be different. CONCLUSIONS: The infection of atypical pathogens related with CAP is quite serious, and MP infection plays a key role in CAP. Besides, the infection rates of the atypical pathogens are different in various populations, as are the associated factors for MP infection."

The coinfection rate of M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) can reach 52% in some areas, but the effects of coinfection with different pathogens have not been clearly recognized. METHODS: The cases of MPP hospitalized in Beijing Children's Hospital from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2016 were screened. MPP patients coinfected with Human adenovirus (HAdV) were categorized into the research group. Patients with single M. pneumoniae infection were categorized into the control group, matching the research group by age and admission time with a ratio of 1:3. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and disease severity were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 2540 hospitalized MPP cases were screened in Beijing Children's Hospital, among which thirty cases were enrolled in the research group and ninety cases were enrolled in the control group. The results indicated that patients in the research group had longer hospital stays, longer fever durations and a higher rate of dyspnea, as well as a larger proportion applications of oxygen therapy and noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). No obvious differences were found in lab examinations within the two groups. Regarding disease severity, the proportions of extremely severe pneumonia and severe disease defined by the clinical score system were higher in the research group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Compared with single M. pneumoniae infection, MPP coinfected with HAdV in children was relatively more serious."

The clinical evaluation of CAP among patients with cancers remains unknown. Patients and Methods: This retrospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Tang Du Hospital, China, from September 2018 to August 2019. The demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between CAP patients with and without cancers. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with CAP patients with and without cancers. Results: Data from 149 CAP patients with cancers and 268 CAP patients without cancers were analyzed. Patients without cancers were more likely to show fever, cough and yellow sputum, higher level of neutrophil count than the cancer patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae 14.77% vs 9.33%, p = 0.093) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae 16.11% vs 11.57%, p = 0.189) were among the most commonly encountered pathogens in both the groups. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. pneumoniae 26.50% vs 11.41%, p < 0.001), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae 8.21% vs 1.34%, p = 0.003), and filamentous fungi (10.82% vs 4.7%, p = 0.033) were predominant in CAP patients without cancers. Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae 22.15% vs 14.18%, p = 0.038) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococci (MRS 23.49 vs 15.68, p = 0.049) were more prevalent for CAP cancer patients. Certain pathogens were increasing in a cold season. In patients without cancers, MRS, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease, connective tissue disease, bronchiectasis, respectively. In addition, healthy adults were likely to be infected with M. pneumoniae showing fever. Conclusion: CAP patients with cancers had atypical clinical manifestations and showed no distinct increase in inflammatory markers. The predominant pathogens differed as well as similar between the CAP patients with and without cancers. Certain pathogens follow a seasonal pattern. CNS disease, connective tissue disease and bronchiectasis were associated with the predominant pathogens in patients without cancers."

The widespread use of macrolides is increasing resistance rates to these antibiotics. Molecular tools can help in diagnosis, typing and resistance detection, leading to better patient management. OBJECTIVES: To assess the MP genotypes and resistance pattern circulating in our area while comparing serological and molecular diagnosis of MP. METHODS: Molecular and serological diagnosis of MP was performed in 821 samples collected in Badalona (Barcelona, Spain) from 2013 to 2017. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and macrolide resistance detection by pyrosequencing were performed in those cases positive by PCR. Presence of respiratory viruses and relevant clinical data were also recorded. RESULTS: MP was detected in 16.8% of cases by PCR, with an overall agreement with serology of 76%. Eleven different MLVA types were identified, with 4-5-7-2 (50.1%) and 3-5-6-2 (29.2%) being the most abundant, with the latter showing a seasonal increase during the study. A total of 8% of the strains harboured a point substitution associated with macrolide resistance, corresponding mainly to an A2063G 23S rRNA mutation and directly related to previous macrolide therapy. Analysis of respiratory viruses showed viral coinfections in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Serological and molecular tools combined could improve MP diagnosis and the analysis of its infection patterns. Macrolide resistance is associated with previous therapy. Given that MP pneumonia usually resolves spontaneously, it should be reconsidered whether antibiotic treatment is suitable for all cases."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma pneumoniaeID:32793529TITLE:Case Report: Clinical and Immunological Features of a Chinese Cohort With Mycoplasma-Induced Rash and Mucositis.ABSTRACT:Dermatological disorders are the most common extrapulmonary complications of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, of which Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM) has recently been proposed to be a separate diagnostic entity. MIRM could easily be misdiagnosed as atypical Stevens-Johnson syndrome by clinicians due to the unawareness of this rare disease. We retrospectively reviewed the inpatient database from Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2019 of the Children's Hospital of Fudan University. In total, five patients (mean age 5.5 years, three male) matched the diagnostic criteria of MIRM. All patients had scattered lesions and more than two sites of mucosal involvement. The serum IgA level of three patients was higher than normal. Two patients had a significant decrease in peripheral blood CD3+ T and CD4+ T cells that improved with recovery. The percentage of TCRalphabeta+ CD4-CD8-T cells of Patient five was higher than normal. All patients received treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids, 3 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin. Among five patients, three patients complained of dyspigmentation, and two patients had an uneventful recovery. MIRM is a separate entity with predominant mucosal involvement and excellent prognosis that more often affects younger patients. Excessive inflammatory reactions may lead to immune disorders, including lymphopenia and a redistribution of CD4+ T cells. We recommend that pneumonia accompanied by mucocutaneous eruptions, especially in young patients, should raise clinical suspicion of MIRM."

We conducted an annual national survey of Japanese children to screen them for C. pneumoniae infections during the M. pneumoniae epidemic season. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from children aged 0-15 years with suspected acute lower respiratory tract infection due to atypical pathogens, at 85 medical facilities in Japan from June 2008 to March 2018. Specimens were tested for infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Of 5002 specimens tested, 1822 (36.5%) were positive for M. pneumoniae alone, 42 (0.8%) were positive for C. pneumoniae alone, and 20 (0.4%) were positive for both organisms. In children with C. pneumoniae infection, the median C. pneumoniae DNA copy number was higher in those with single infections than in those with M. pneumoniae coinfection (p = 0.08); however it did not differ significantly according to whether the children had received antibiotics prior to sample collection (p = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. pneumoniae infection was substantially lower than that of M. pneumoniae infection during the study period. The change in prevalence of C. pneumoniae was not influenced by that of M. pneumoniae. Children with single C. pneumoniae infection are likely to have had C. pneumoniae infection, while those with coinfection are likely to have been C. pneumoniae carriers."

There are limited data in the U.S. investigating the molecular epidemiological characteristics of Mp. We collected 446 Mp-positive specimens from 9 states, between August 2012 and October 2018. Culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, P1 subtyping and multi-locus VNTR (variable number tandem repeats) analysis (MLVA) were performed to characterize the isolates. Macrolide-resistant Mp (MRMp) was detected in 37 (8.3%) specimens. P1 subtype 2 (P1-2) was the predominant P1 subtype (59.8%). P1 subtype distribution did not change significantly chronologically or geographically. Macrolide resistance rate in P1 subtype 1 (P1-1) samples was significantly higher than that in P1-2 (12.9% vs 5.5%). Six P1-2 variants were identified, including two novel types, and variant 2c was predominant (64.6%). P1-2 variants distributed significantly different among geographic regions. Classical P1-2 was more in lower respiratory tract specimens and had longer p1 trinucleotide repeats. Classical P1-2 was most common in MRMp (35.7%), while variant 2c was the most in macrolide susceptible Mp (67.5%). Fifteen MLVA types were identified; 3-5-6-2 (41.7%), 4-5-7-2 (35.3%) and 3-6-6-2 (16.6%) were the major types and four MLVA clusters were delineated. The distribution of MLVA types varied significantly over time and geographic location. The predominant MLVA type switched from 4-5-7-2 to 3-5-6-2 in 2015. MLVA type was associated with P1 subtypes and P1-2 variant types but not with MR. To investigate the Mp genotype shift and its impact on clinical presentations, additional surveillance programs targeting more diverse populations and prolonged sampling times are required."

Methods: Three groups of children were enrolled into the prospective study during January 20 to February 20, 2020 from Capital Institute of Pediatrics, including children in the exposed group with ARI and epidemiological history associated with COVID-19 from whom both pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, children in the ARI group without COVID-19 associated epidemiological history and children in the screening group for hospital admission, with neither COVID-19 associated epidemiological history nor ARI. Only nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in the ARI group and screening group. Each group is expected to include at least 30 cases. All specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by two diagnostic kits from different manufacturers. All nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for multiple respiratory pathogens, whilst the results from the ARI group were compared with that in the correspondence periods of 2019 and 2018 used by t or chi(2) test. Results: A total of 244 children were enrolled into three groups, including 139 males and 105 females, the age was (5+-4) years. The test of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid were negative in all children, and high positive rates of pathogens were detected in exposed (69.4%, 25/36) and ARI (55.3%, 73/132) groups, with the highest positive rate for mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) (19.4%, 7/36 and 17.4%, 23/132, respectively), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (16.7%, 6/36 and 9.8%, 13/132, respectively). The positive rate (11.8%, 9/76) of pathogens in the screening group was low. In the same period of 2019, the positive rate of pathogens was 83.7% (77/92), with the highest rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (29.3%, 27/92), followed by influenza virus (Flu) A (H1N1) (19.6%, 18/92) and adenovirus (ADV) (14.1%, 13/92), which showed significant difference with the positive rates of the three viruses in 2020 (RSV A: chi(2)=27.346, P<0.01; FluA (H1N1): chi(2)=28.083, P<0.01; ADV: chi(2)=7.848, P=0.005) . In 2018, the positive rate of pathogens was 61.0% (50/82), with the highest rate for human bocavirus (HBoV) (13.4%, 11/82) and followed by ADV (11.0%, 9/82), and significant difference was shown in the positive rate of HBoV with that in 2020 (chi(2)=6.776, P=0.009). Conclusions: The infection rate of 2019-nCoV is low among children in Beijing with no family clustering or no close contact, even with epidemiological history. The spectrum of pathogens of ARI in children during the research period is quite different from that in the previous years when the viral infections were dominant. MP is the highest positively detected one among the main pathogens during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing where there is no main outbreak area."

However, the alterations of lung microbiota in MPP with bronchial mucus plugs and its role in disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we performed a longitudinal 16S rRNA-based microbiome survey on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples collected from 31 MPP with bronchial mucus plugs and 52 MPP without mucus plugs. RESULTS: Our study showed a clear difference in airway microbiota between MPP children with and without bronchial mucus plugs. The MPP children with mucus plugs had lower abundances of Sphingomonas and Elizabethkingia, and a high abundance of Mycoplasma compared with MPP children without mucus plugs, subsequently contributing to increased ratios of Mycoplasma to Sphingomonas and Mycoplasma to Elizabethkingia. Children's age, fever time and serum cytokine levels were associated with airway microbiota alteration. Furthermore, significant correlations between bacterial genus abundances were found in MPP children with mucus plugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an impact of airway microbiota on the clinical course of MPP in children, deserving further investigations."

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. RESULTS: Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679-0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310-9.353, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary."

Resistance to macrolides, the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection, is a major global public health concern. However, studies evaluating macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection simultaneously in all ages are limited. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in terms of age distribution. METHODS: We enrolled 292 patients in Tokyo, Japan, who visited Eiju General Hospital or Zama Children's Clinic in 2015-2016. Patients were tested using real-time PCR for M. pneumoniae DNA. PCR-positive patients (n = 151) were further selected and sequentially divided into preschool-aged children (<=5 years, n = 31), school-aged children (6-15 years, n = 101), adolescents (16-19 years, n = 5), and adults (>=20 years, n = 14). We then analyzed the M. pneumoniae infection clinical characteristics, prevalence of macrolide-resistant infection, and 23S rRNA domain V resistance-associated mutation status. RESULTS: We found insignificant differences in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection among all groups, clinical characteristics, and resistance-associated mutation status in patients with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection. We also found statistically higher prevalence of mutation-positive (n = 85) M. pneumoniae in patients previously treated with macrolide compared to the mutation-negative group (n = 66); 63.8% vs 11.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences in both clinical characteristics and prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection among all ages. Also, previous macrolide treatment contributes to drug-resistance."

This study was conducted to detect M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in children with community-acquired LRTIs employing serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR analysis. Material and Methods: This study included 75 children with acute LRTIs for detection of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Blood was obtained for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae antibodies and nasopharyngeal aspirates for M. pneumoniae PCR and C. pneumoniae nested PCR. Results: M. pneumoniae infection was positive in 9 (64.21%) children aged 2-6 months and in 5 (35.79%) aged 7 months-12 years, and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.002). C. pneumoniae infection was comparable within the age group and statistically insignificant (P = 0.43). Clinical and radiological profiles of M. pneumoniae- and C. pneumoniae-positive and negative patients were numerically comparable. Serology and PCR together detected M. pneumoniae infection in 14 (18.6%) children. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of serology were 77.78%, 92.42%, 58.33% and 96.83%, respectively. C. pneumoniae infection was positive in 11 (14.6%) children by serology and nested PCR with 50% sensitivity, 87.67% specificity, 10% positive predictive value and 98.46% negative predictive value. Conclusions: Our study confirms that M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae play a significant role in community-acquired LRTIs and a combination of serology and nested PCR is useful for its diagnosis."

The disease was officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). The clinical symptoms may include fever, cough, fatigue, headache, and diarrhea. The radiographic features comprise various presentations, including ground-glass opacities, tiny nodules, and consolidation. However, some atypical pathogens related to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may share similar presentations. They may be difficult to distinguish according to the clinical presentation and radiographic findings. Recently, there have been several reports reminding physicians to heed the possibility of co-infection with other pathogens in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We report a COVID-19 patient co-infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae who recovered well after combination therapy.

Distinguishing between viral and bacterial infection is challenging when children suffered from LRTI in the absence of pathogen detection. The aim of our study is to analyze the difference of serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) between viral LRTI and bacterial LRTI in children. Methods: This retrospective study included children with LRTI caused by a single pathogen from Yancheng Third People's Hospital, Yancheng, China, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019. Participants were divided into the younger group (1 year old <= age < 3 years old) and the older group (3 years old <= age < 5 years old) for subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 475 children with LRTI caused by common respiratory pathogens were identified. In the younger group as well as the older group, the serum level of beta2-MG in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly increased compared to that in the Mycoplasma pneumoniae group. Compared with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection group, the serum beta2-MG level of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly higher in children between 1 and 3 years old.

Its treatment is difficult. The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of 20 cases of RMPP in children in order to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of RMPP. METHODS: The clinical data of 20 patients with RMPP admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in the recent three years were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical data of 36 patients with common mycoplasma pneumonia in the same period were compared. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and imaging characteristics of RMPP were discussed. Intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications and treatment were also analyzed in order to provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the refractory group and the general group in terms of heat duration, hospitalization time, hypoxemia, lung rales, CRP, ESR, PCT, LDH, ALT, PLT, WBC, D dimer and other laboratory examinations, intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, and treatment (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the age, sex, and wheezing between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Long duration of fever, tachycardia, and lung rale protrusion may be the clinical characteristics of RMPP. Unilateral pulmonary shadow and atelectasis should be paid more attention, which may be a high-risk factor for the development of RMPP. The inflammation index of RMPP cases increased and there were many complications inside and outside the patients' lungs. It was necessary to give enough macrolides to fight the infection by using Glucocorticoid and Intravenous immunoglobulin reasonably while liver, heart, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy was completed to improve the effectiveness of the diagnosis and treatment."

Patients and Methods: We included 250 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. RT-PCR was used to detect influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial viruses. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect IgM antibodies for adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the serum of patients. Based on these results, we divided the patients into two groups, the simple SARS-CoV-2-infected group and the coinfected SARS-COV-2 group. Coinfected patients were then further categorized as having a coinfection of viral pathogen (CoIV) or coinfection of atypical bacterial pathogen (CoIaB). Results: No statistically significant differences were found in age, gender, the time taken to return negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, length of hospital stays, and mortality between the simple SARS-CoV-2 infection group and the coinfection group. Of the 250 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 39 (15.6%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen in addition to SARS-CoV-2. A third of these pathogens were detected as early as the 1st week after symptom onset and another third were identified after more than three weeks. The most detected CAP pathogen was C. pneumoniae (5.2%), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4.8%), M. pneumoniae (4.4%) and adenovirus (2.8%). Patients coinfected with viral pathogens (CoIV) (n=18) had longer hospital stays when compared to patients coinfected with atypical bacterial pathogens (CoIaB) (n=21). Except for one fatality, the remaining 38 coinfected patients all recovered with favourable outcomes. Conclusion: Coinfections in COVID-19 patients are common. The coinfecting pathogens can be detected at variable intervals during COVID-19 disease course and remain an important consideration in targeted treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients."

METHODS: A total of 75 children with MPP and atelectasis were divided into a good response group with 51 children and a poor response group with 24 children according to the clinical effect of BAL treatment. LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing the clinical effect of BAL treatment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and restricted cubic spline model analysis were used to evaluate the value of the course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment in predicting the clinical effect of BAL treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the good response group, the poor response group had a significantly lower percentage of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a significantly higher proportion of children with atelectasis of two or more lung lobes or stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening caused by inflammation, and a significantly longer course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment and azithromycin treatment (P<0.05). The LASSO logistic regression analysis showed that a prolonged course of the disease at the time of BAL treatment (OR=1.23), atelectasis of two or more lung lobes (OR=11.99), and stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening caused by inflammation (OR=5.31) were independent risk factors for poor clinical effect of BAL treatment (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that the course of disease of >=11.5 days at the time of BAL treatment suggested a poor clinical effect of BAL treatment, with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 54.9%. The restricted cubic spline model analysis showed that there was a non-linear dose-response relationship between the course of disease at the time of BAL treatment and the clinical effect of BAL treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early BAL treatment may have a good clinical effect in children with MPP and atelectasis. Atelectasis of two or more lung lobes and inflammation-induced stenosis of the bronchial cavity or opening shown under bronchoscope may indicate a poor clinical effect of BAL treatment."

Reactive arthritis and sacroiliitis are unusual extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection, which is a common condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old Greek previously healthy man presented to our emergency department with fever, progressively worsening bilateral lower limb weakness, and asymmetric oligoarthritis. Our diagnosis was based on a positive polymerase chain reaction test for M. pneumoniae using blood and cerebrospinal fluid and magnetic resonance imaging findings that suggested sacroiliitis. Our patient was also found to be human leukocyte antigen B27 positive. His infection was successfully treated with a 14-day course of doxycycline; the arthritis was treated with naproxen and corticosteroids. His arthritis, which restricted his mobility, improved progressively, and he was discharged without any neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In our case, an acute M. pneumoniae infection eventually progressed to chronic spondyloarthropathy. In our patient, M. pneumoniae infection may represent a random event, or it might be a necessary factor for the development of reactive arthritis, asymmetric proximal myopathy, and sacroiliitis, always in combination with the appropriate genetic background. Extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae may occur even in the complete absence of respiratory symptoms, and the diagnosis of unusual complications, such as reactive arthritis, requires high clinical suspicion and extensive investigation."

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with PCR-positive MPP requiring ICU admission in a children's hospital in Taipei, Taiwan from Jun 2010 to October 2019. Clinical manifestations and laboratory data of severe MPP were analyzed. Macrolide susceptibility was determined by genotyping, and its relationship with clinical manifestations was also analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately 5% (34/658) children hospitalized for MPP required ICU admission. Compared with non-ICU cases (n = 291), ICU cases (n = 34) were associated with more underlying conditions, more pleural effusion, longer fever duration, longer hospital stay, the requirement of second-line antibiotic treatment, and delayed effective and second-line antibiotic treatment. Macrolide resistance was similar in ICU and non-ICU groups (53% vs 53%; p = 0.986). In severe MPP, patients requiring endotracheal intubation were associated with more septic shock, empyema, ARDS, prolonged fever after effective antibiotic treatment, delayed second-line and effective antibiotic treatment. In 18 of the 22 patients with pleural fluid analysis, the pleural effusion was alkaline (pH > 7.7) and lymphocyte-predominant. CONCLUSION: M. pneumoniae infection can cause severe life-threatening pneumonia in children. Delayed effective and second-line antibiotic treatments are associated with severe life-threatening MPP."

These agents are mostly associated with infection in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these pathogens among patients with CAP attending outpatient clinics in Tehran. A cross-sectional study was carried out of 150 patients attending to educational hospitals in Tehran with CAP. M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected by PCR assay, targeting the P1 adhesion gene, macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively from throat swabs obtained from each patient. A total of 86 (57.3%) of 150 patients were women; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 35-65 years). M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 37 (24.7%), 25 (16.7%) and 11 (7.3%) patients respectively; of these, 66 patients (44%) were infected at least by one of these three pathogens. The frequency of L. pneumophila was significantly higher among patients over 60 years old (p 0.03). Coinfection was detected in seven patients (4.7%); six were infected by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and only one was infected by L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent agent of atypical CAP, and L. pneumophila was more likely to infect elderly rather than younger people. Further studies on the prevalence of CAP and its aetiologic agents are needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CAP patients."

This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children in a general hospital. Methods: A total of 2011 CAP children aged 1-16 years hospitalized at Peking University Third Hospital from 2017 to 2019 were enrolled by cross-sectional study for the retrospective analysis of the clinical data mainly including seasonal distribution of MPP, hospital stay, severity, complications, use of flexible bronchoscopy, and hospitalization costs. The dynamic changes of CAP and MPP children within 3 consecutive years and the differences between the MPP group and non-MPP groups were compared. Results: The proportion of CAP children among hospitalized children was 32.4%, 38.5%, and 39.5% in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, showing an upward trend (P<0.05).The prevalence rate of MPP was highest in the third quarter (30.2%) and the fourth quarter (39.2%) and lowest in the second quarter (13.2%) (chi2=51.8, P<0.05). Compared with the non-MPP group, the MPP group had significantly higher incidence of severe pneumonia (19.4% vs. 12.0%, chi2=20.99), incidence of complications (16.1% vs. 6.5%, chi2=48.24), proportion of patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy (38.4% vs. 9.0%, chi2=252.79), and hospitalization costs (all P<0.05), along with significantly longer hospital stay (6 vs. 4 days, z=-11.131). A dynamic comparison of the clinical characteristics of MPP in 3 years showed that the number of children with MPP increased significantly in preschoolers in 2018 (37.3%) and in school-aged or older children in 2019 (53%) (P<0.05). MPP peaks occurred in August 2018 and November 2019. The total hospitalization costs, examination fees, and non-medication treatment costs increased significantly (the z values were 35.24, 46.79, and 9.64, respectively; P<0.05) year by year among MPP children; there was no significant difference in the medication cost over these 3 years (z=4.81, P>0.05). Conclusions: The proportions of severe pneumonia, complications, and use of flexible bronchoscopy as well as the hospitalization days and costs are higher in MPP children. General hospitals should develop integrated clinical quality control programs for MPP children, so as to optimize the allocation of medical resources."

METHODS: Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 and 21 patients with adult mycoplasma pneumonia confirmed with RT-PCR test were enrolled from Zibo First Hospital and Lanshan People's Hospital during December 1st 2019 and March 14th 2020. The early chest CT manifestations were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The interstitial changes with ground glass density shadow (GGO) were similar in two groups during first chest CT examination (P>0.05). There were more lung lobes involved on the first chest CT in COVID-19 patients, which were mostly distributed in the dorsal outer zone (23/26, 88.5%), and nearly half of them (12/26, 46.2%) were accompanied by crazy-paving sign; while the lesions in adult mycoplasma pneumonia patients were mostly distributed along the bronchi, and the bronchial wall was thickened (19/21, 90.5%), accompanied with tree buds / fog signs (19/21, 90.5%). The above CT signs were significantly different between the two kinds of pneumonia (all P<0.01). COVID-19 had a longer course compared with mycoplasma pneumonia, the disease peaks of COVID-19 patients was on day (10.5+-3.8), while the disease on CT was almost absorbed on day (7.9+-2.2) in adult mycoplasma pneumonia. The length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients was significantly longer than that of mycoplasma pneumonia patients [(19.5+-4.3) d vs (7.9+-2.2) d, P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: The lesions of adult mycoplasma pneumonia are mostly distributed along the bronchi with tree buds/fog signs, while the lesions of COVID-19 are mainly distributed in the dorsal outer zone accompanied by crazy-paving sign, which can early distinguish two diseases."

Evidence indicates that Bordetella pertussis has an important role in the aetiology of LRTI. We aimed to study the association between B. pertussis and other respiratory pathogens in children hospitalised with severe LRTI, and to assess clinical relevance of co-detection. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and induced sputa (IS) were tested with a B. pertussis specific PCR; additionally, IS was tested for other pathogens using a multiplex PCR. We included 454 children, median age 8 months (IQR 4-18), 31 (7%) of whom tested positive for B. pertussis. Children with B. pertussis had more bacterial pathogens detected (3 versus 2; P < 0.001). While B. pertussis showed no association with most pathogens, it was independently associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and parainfluenza viruses with adjusted risk ratios of 4.01 (1.03-15.64), 4.17 (1.42-12.27) and 2.13 (1.03-4.55), respectively. There was a consistent increased risk of severe disease with B. pertussis. Patterns indicated even higher risks when B. pertussis was co-detected with any of the three organisms although not statistically significant.

Of note, clonal expansion of macrolide-resistant ST3 occurred in Japan and South Korea. An alarming surge in macrolide resistance complicated the treatment of pneumonia. We aimed to evaluate the clinical manifestation and the clonal relatedness of M. pneumoniae circulating among children in Taiwan. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 626 children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia between 2017 and 2019. M. pneumoniae infection was suspected on clinical grounds, and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction and oropharyngeal swab cultures. We used multi-locus sequence typing and whole-genome sequencing to characterize the genetic features of M. pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 226 children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Macrolide resistance was found in 77% (174/226) patients. Multi-locus sequence typing revealed that ST3 (n=93) and its single-locus variant ST17 (n=84) were the predominant clones among macrolide-resistant strains. ST17 presented clinical characteristics comparable to its ancestor ST3. On multivariate analysis, macrolide resistance (OR, 3.5; 95%IC, 1.4-8.5; P=0.007) was independently associated with fever >72 hours after macrolide treatment. By whole genome sequencing, prediction analysis of recombination sites revealed one recombination site in ST3 and ST17 compared with M29 (a macrolide-sensitive ST3 strain isolated from China in 2005))containing cytadhesin MgpC-like protein, RepMP4, and RepMP5. ST17 had another recombination site containing an adhesin and RepMP2/3. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to macrolide resistance, ST3 and its ST17 variant might evolve through recombination between repetitive sequences and non-P1 cytadhesins for persistent circulation in Taiwan."

METHODS: Between February 2013 and February 2015, 107 patients were analyzed. Sixty-nine comprised the inpatient and 38 comprised the outpatient treatment group. RESULTS: When non-specific culture results were taken into consideration only, a causative organism could be detected in 46.7% of the patients. The detection rate increased to 85.1% with the additional use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test and culture methods. More than one causative agent was responsible for COPD exacerbation in 53.3% of patients: two agents in 37.3%, three agents in 15%, and four agents in 0.9%. H.influenzae was detected in 63 (58.9%) patients, S.pneumoniae in 57 (53.2%), P.aeruginosa in 15 (14.0%) and L.pneumophila in 11 (10%). L.pneumophila was the more commonly isolated agent in the inpatient group (p=0.002).Patients receiving continuous oxygen therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have an exacerbation associated with P.aeruginosa (p=0.008 and p=0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: The additional use of DFA for Legionella and multiplex PCR in combination with non-specific microbiological culturing methods greatly improves the ability to identify infectious agents in acute exacerbations of COPD. There should be a high index of suspicion for P.aeruginosa as a causative organism, particularly in subjects receiving continuous oxygen therapy and/or using NIV and L.pneumophilia should certainly be taken into consideration in severe COPD exacerbations."

Since this pathogen may possess a latent period after infection, which sometimes leads to misdiagnosis by traditional diagnosis methods, the establishment of a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method is crucial for transmission prevention and timely treatment. Herein, a novel detection method was established for M. pneumoniae detection. The method, which improves upon a denaturation bubble-mediated strand exchange amplification (SEA) that we developed in 2016, is called accelerated SEA (ASEA). The established ASEA achieved detection of 1% M. pneumoniae genomic DNA in a DNA mixture from multiple pathogens, and the limit of detection (LOD) of ASEA was as low as 1.0 x 10-17 M (approximately 6.0 x 103 copies/mL). Considering that the threshold of an asymptomatic carriage is normally recommended as 1.0 x 104 copies/mL, this method was able to satisfy the requirement for practical diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. Moreover, the detection process was finished within 20.4 min, significantly shorter than real-time PCR and SEA. Furthermore, ASEA exhibited excellent performance in clinical specimen analysis, with sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 100%, respectively, compared with the ""gold standard"" real-time PCR. More importantly, similar to real-time PCR, ASEA requires only one pair of primers and ordinary commercial polymerase, and can be carried out using a conventional fluorescence real-time PCR instrument, which makes this method low-cost and easy to accomplish. Therefore, ASEA has the potential for wide use in the rapid detection of M. pneumoniae or other pathogens in large numbers of specimens. Graphical abstract."

Approximately 10% of cases develop clinical signs of pneumonia with ""atypical"" radiographic pattern. However, mycoplasma pneumoniae can be responsible for a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations, potentially involving all systems and apparatuses. Although exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not completely known, these could be secondary to direct invasion of the target organ, immunological damage due to molecular mimicry or vascular obstruction. A 45-year-old man was admitted to Internal Medicine Unit because of fever, dry cough and fatigue lasting 15 days. Fever disappeared after starting clarithromycin. About 72 h after admission the patient complained of right calf pain and tachypnea. The presence of anti-mycoplasma antibodies suggested mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Moreover, a diagnosis of venous thrombo-embolism was performed. Given the absence of classical risk factors for thrombosis, patient was investigated for inherited and acquired thrombophilia and tested positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. A review of the English literature on the association between m. pneumoniae and pulmonary embolism will be provided in order to underline the possible pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in this setting. Clinicians should outweigh risk and benefits for LMWH prophylaxis case by case considering these adjunctive pro-thrombotic mechanisms in patients m. pneumoniae infection."

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury. METHODS: In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases). RESULTS: We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase >=5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to >=1.5 times baseline or increase by >=27 mumol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases.

A retrospective study of MPP patients with large pulmonary lesions hospitalized from January 2008 to December 2019 was enrolled, and clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiological findings were analyzed. Of 135 MPP patients with large pulmonary lesions, 56 were in the NP group, 79 were in the NNP group. We found the median length of fever days were much longer in NP group than those in NNP group. Higher levels of WBC, CRP, LDH, IL-6 in NP group were observed. Furthermore, the incidence of pulmonary consolidation was much higher in NP patients than that in NNP patients, while the CT value of large pulmonary lesion was much lower in NP patients. In ROC curve analysis, the cut-off values for the CT value and IFN-gamma were 36.43 and 7.25 pg/ml, respectively. NP caused by MPP might be easier to suffer from prolonged clinical course, severe laboratory and radiological findings.

Current diagnostic tests of mycoplasma pneumoniae infections of the respiratory tract such as PCR and serology are either somewhat unreliable or slow and do not entirely meet the clinical needs of accurate and fast diagnosis. The aim of this report was to examine a panel of candidate biomarkers and their capacity to distinguish mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory infections from respiratory infections caused by either bacterial or virus. METHOD: Patients with confirmed etiology of their acute respiratory infections (n = 156) were included of which 28 patients were diagnosed with mycoplasma pneumoniae. Blood was taken before any antibiotics treatment and analysed for Azurocidin (HBP), Calprotectin, CRP, Human Neutrophil Lipocalin (HNL), Interferon gamma-induced Protein 10 kDa (IP-10), Procalcitonin (PCT), Thymidine Kinase 1 (TK1), TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). RESULTS: Individually the concentrations of IP-10, TK1 and P-HNL distinguished mycoplasma pneumoniae from bacterial infections with AUCs of 0.79-0.85. However, in combination, TK1 with either IP-10 or P-HNL showed an AUC of 0.97-0.95. In the distinction between mycoplasma pneumoniae and viral respiratory infections CRP, Calprotectin and TRAIL showed individual AUCs of 0.94-0.84. Together with either P-HNL dimer or PCT, CRP showed AUCs of 0.97. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that it may be possible to design useful diagnostic algorithms of biomarkers that could help distinguish mycoplasma pneumoniae from respiratory infections caused by bacteria or virus. The development of rapid point-of-care assays based on such algorithms could be clinically useful tools in the therapeutic decision-making."

Over recent years, the widespread use of macrolides has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant M.pneumoniae (MRMP) resulted from mutations at specific positions of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Methods: We collected 100 samples of throat swabs from patients with respiratory infections. After extraction of DNA from bacterial cell cultured in PPLO broth media using Roche kit (Germany), the PCR was performed on specific samples of M. pneumoniae using specific primers for 23S rRNA gene.Afterwards, for positive samples, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth microdilution with Clarithromycin. Finally, the PCR product was sequenced to detect mutations related to macrolide resistance in domain V of 23S rRNA . Results: According to the analysis of the sequenced PCR product of M. pneumoniae 23S rRNA gene using Clustalw2 online software, one of the samples were shown to have a mutation at A2431G and G2491A positions.

MP pneumonia is a risk factor for the development of post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO). The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for the development of PIBO after MP pneumonia in the era of increasing macrolide resistance of MP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 150 children with a mean age of 6.0 years admitted to the hospital due to MP pneumonia between May 2019 and February 2020 at a tertiary hospital. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data were obtained using retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Eighteen children (12%) were diagnosed with PIBO after MP pneumonia. PIBO was diagnosed after a mean duration of 100.0 days (range, 6-268 days) from symptom onset. The respiratory virus co-infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.069; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.224-13.523), adenovirus co-infection (aOR, 5.607; 95% CI, 1.801-17.454), longer duration between symptom onset and admission (aOR, 1.150; 95% CI, 1.020-1.298), higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of admission (aOR, 1.001; 95% CI, 1.000-1.003), and poor response to stepwise treatment increased the risk for development of PIBO after MP pneumonia. However, macrolide resistance of MP was not associated with development of PIBO after MP pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that respiratory virus co-infection, including adenovirus, poor response to the treatment of MP pneumonia, and higher levels of serum LDH, but not macrolide resistance of MP, are risk factors of PIBO after MP pneumonia."

Although we the initial evolution was favorable being treated with 3rd class cephalosporin and Oxacillin, on the 8th day of admission the fever and the acute phase reactants levels increased as well as the quantity of the pleural effusion, requiring surgical drainage. We ruled out lung tuberculosis, but we identified positive IgM for both MP and CP. Based on these findings we changed the antibiotic therapy on Levofloxacin for 10 days with favorable evolution.

METHODS: Sixty-one children enrolled in the MUCOVIB multicentre prospective cohort provided 746 samples, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputa which were analysed using culture, specific real-time qPCRs and 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomics. RESULTS: Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 3) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 1) were prospectively documented in 6.6% of CF children. Microbiota alpha-diversity in children with a documented C. pneumoniae was highly variable, similarly to children infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The transition from routine follow-up visits to pulmonary exacerbation (n = 17) yielded variable changes in diversity indexes with some extreme loss of diversity. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of C. pneumoniae detection supports the need for regular screenings in CF patients. A minor impact of C. pneumoniae on the microbial community structure was documented, likely due to a limited sample size and high inter-individual diversity, stressing the need for larger-scale investigations. Although detected in a single patient, M. pneumoniae should also be considered as a possible aetiology of lung infection in CF subjects."

","SPECIES:Mycoplasma pneumoniaeID:33268306TITLE:Rational stepwise approach for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children.ABSTRACT:Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen that causes community-acquired pneumonia. In the past, M. pneumoniae was sensitive to macrolide antibiotics, and M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) was usually a benign and self-limiting disease. However, despite use of the appropriate antibiotics, persistent fever and clinical deterioration may occur, leading to severe disease. Two major complicated conditions that may be clinically encountered are macrolide-resistant MPP and refractory MPP. Regarding the epidemics in Taiwan, before 2017, the mean rate of macrolide resistance was below 30%. Notably, since 2018, the prevalence of macrolide-resistant MPP in Taiwan has increased rapidly. Macrolide-resistant MPP shows persistent fever and/or no radiological regression to macrolide antibiotics and may even progress to severe and complicated pneumonia. Tetracyclines (doxycycline or minocycline) or fluoroquinolones are alternative treatments for macrolide-resistant MPP. Refractory MPP is characterized by an excessive immune response against the pathogen. In this context, corticosteroids have been suggested as an immunomodulator for downregulating the overactive host immune reaction. Overuse of macrolides may contribute to macrolide resistance, and thereafter, an increase in macrolide-resistant MPP. Delayed effective antimicrobial treatment is associated with prolonged and/or more severe disease. Thus, the appropriate prescription of antibiotics, as well as the rapid and accurate diagnosis of MPP, is important. The exact starting point, dose, and duration of the immunomodulator are yet to be established. We discuss these important issues in this review."

METHODS: We included hospitalized young children (1-72 months of age) with CAP caused by Mp infection. Mp RNA was detected as soon as the patient was admitted and the dynamics of Mp-RNA were monitored after the beginning of azithromycin treatment on Days 4, 7, 14 and 28. RESULTS: Among 40 hospitalized young children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (Mpp), 16 had wheezing. Time to first positive Mp-RNA confirmation after symptom onset of Mpp was similar for the wheezy group (median 7 days, interquartile range 7-10.5) and the non-wheezy group (median 7 days, interquartile range 5.8-8.3).

Physicians may overprescribe antimicrobials owing to the concern of bacterial infections, including those because of atypical pathogens. We investigated the accuracy of clinical predictions concerning atypical pathogen infections. Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented with a fever and cough in outpatient clinics between December 2016 and August 2018. After taking a history and performing physical examinations, physicians predicted the possibility of respiratory infections because of atypical pathogens. Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: >=50%, intermediate: 20% >= and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. Results: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3-39.2) were associated with the detections. Atypical pathogens were detected in 32.3% of high-probability cases (10/31), while atypical pathogens were only detected in 8.8% of intermediate-probability cases (8/91) and 3.4% of low-probability cases (3/88) (P < .001). Conclusions: The current study indicates that physicians' predictions were associated with the detection of atypical pathogens; however, overestimation was observed."

Our study aimed to identify the effects of low-dose corticosteroids on the recovery of children with MPP. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, pediatric inpatients with MPP were included from the Shanghai Children's Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia cohort study between August 2014 and July 2019. The multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to investigate the effects of low-dose corticosteroid treatment on fever duration after admission, total fever duration, length of hospital stay, C-reactive protein recovery time, and imaging recovery time with the stratification of severe pneumonia, refractory pneumonia, inflammatory biomarkers, pulmonary images, and timing of corticosteroids. Results: There were 548 patients in the corticosteroid group and 337 in the no-corticosteroid group. The corticosteroid group showed severe clinical parameters such as more severe and refractory cases, higher laboratory values, and more abnormal imaging manifestations. The corticosteroid group also showed longer fever duration after admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.1), P = 0.008], longer total fever duration [OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.3), P = 0.011], longer hospital stay [OR = 2.8 (95% CI, 1.9-4.0), P < 0.001], and longer C-reactive protein (CRP) recovery time [OR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9), P = 0.021] in the regression model after the adjustment for severity. Although low-dose corticosteroids were associated with shortened imaging recovery time in patients with high level laboratory values, pulmonary imaging could be completely recovered in both groups. The trend of these results was consistent even after stratifications and a propensity scores matching analysis. Conclusions: Low-dose corticosteroids may not be beneficial in children inpatients with MPP, and further studies on proper treatment modality are needed in the MRMP era."

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are susceptible to infections due to the chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs and the autoimmune disorders. Now we report a case of SLE infected with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae concurrently. The patient used hydroxychloroquine and prednisone chronically to control the SLE. After infection of SARS-CoV-2, she was given higher dose of prednisone than before and the same dosage of hydroxychloroquine. Besides, some empirical treatments such as antiviral, antibiotic and immunity regulating therapies were also given. The patient finally recovered from COVID-19. This case indicated that hydroxychloroquine may not be able to fully protect SLE patient form SARS-CoV-2. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapies and increased dose of corticosteroids might be adoptable for patient with both COVID-19 and SLE.

Mycoplasma is an uncommon co-infected pathogen with SARS-CoV-2 and has not yet been reported. Computed tomography (CT), used as an accessory examination, may play a more significant role in this co-infection. CASE SUMMARY: A 49-year-old female presented with a cough, expectoration and chest congestion followed by elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. CT images showed ground-glass opacities in bilateral lower lobes and a patchy and striate shadow in the right upper lobe. Immunoglobulin M antibody of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was positive and real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of sputum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The diagnosis of CoVID-19 was made based on laboratory results, chest CT images, clinical manifestations and epidemiologic characteristics. She was treated with combination therapy for 17 d and showed a marked reCoVery. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycoplasma in CoVID-19 patients appears to be uncommon. CT is an acceptable method for the primary diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Combination therapy with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, traditional Chinese herbal medicine and interferon inhalation may be a reference for further progress in treating this co-infection."

A retrospective study of inpatients diagnosed with CAP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dali University (Dali, Yunnan, China) between January 2018 and June 2020 was conducted. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data of the patients with CAP were analyzed. Univariate analyses identified predictors for MP infections. The discriminative power of C-reactive protein (CPR), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP/PCT and CPR/PCT >350 mug/ng was assessed by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A total of 552 CAP patients, including 247 (44.7%) with MP, 152 (27.6%) with SP and 153 (27.7%) with influenza A and B viruses, were enrolled. When comparing MP with SP, cough and CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng (odds ratio [OR]) 2.88, p < .001) were predictors for MP. CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng had 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity (AUC = 0.89, p < .001, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.81-0.94) to predict MP infections. Furthermore, similar results were again obtained when comparing MP with VP. CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng present better information (OR: 4.70; AUC = 0.92, p < .001, 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity). In addition, comparing MP and non-MP (SP and VP combined), CRP/PCT >350 mug/ng exhibited excellent performance (AUC = 0.90, 95%CI 0.83-0.95, p < .001, 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity).

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and IL-6 have correlation with Mycoplasma pneumoniae lung infection and MPP pathogenesis. METHOD: miRNAs participate in the pathogenesis of various diseases by regulating the development and differentiation of the immune cell. Blood was collected and total RNA was isolated. miRNA microarrays were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in MPP patients. The levels of relative miRNAs and mRNAs were evaluated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: There are 23 differentially expressed miRNAs in MPP children's plasma, 15 miRNAs had enhanced expression and 8 had depressed expression. MPP patients showed lower mir-1323 level in blood samples than healthy controls. MPP patients with pleural effusion had much higher Il6 and Il17a mRNA levels than those without pleural effusion. The expression level of Il6 had a negative correlation with miR-1323 level. In the human THP-1 cell line, the level of miR-1323 was significantly reduced through lipopolysaccharides treatment. In THP-1 cells, overexpression or silencing of miR-1323 significantly reduced or promoted Il6 expression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, miR-1323 targets the mRNA of Il6 and inhibits the expression of Il6. The pathogenesis of MPP inhibits the expression of miR-1323 in macrophages, triggers the overexpression of Il6, and enhances inflammation response."

Its incidence rate is increasing year by year. The drug resistance rate of macrolide antibiotics and other conventional treatment methods is higher, and there are limitations in clinical application. Traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) is a powerful weapon to treat this disease. At present, there is no comparison of the safety and effectiveness of multiple TCPMs in the treatment of MPP in children. Therefore, we take the method of network meta-analysis to systematically compare the efficacy of various TCPMs in the treatment of this disease. METHODS: We will conduct comprehensive searches of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Clinical Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Chinese BioMedical Literature, Wanfang Database, and other electronic databases. The time frame is set from the establishment of the database to October 2020. All randomized controlled trials that meet the inclusion criteria will be included in this study. The 2 researchers will independently screen the literature according to the inclusion criteria, extract the data, and assess the bias risk of the included study. We will evaluate all the obtained data and evidence through Bayesian network meta-analysis, and use Stata 15.0 to process and analyze the data. RESULTS: Through this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a variety of TCPMs for the treatment of MPP in children.

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

The health systems are facing significant challenges in carrying out the diagnosis and treatment of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children. Levofloxacin is suitable for treating infectious diseases in various systems but limited in children due to arthropathy issues in weight-bearing joints. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in children with macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled six confirmed cases of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia who were admitted in the paediatric respiratory ward of Shandong provincial hospital Affiliated to Shandong first Medical University between 1st January 2020 and 29th February 2020. Levofloxacin was given to the patients through the intravenous or oral route as per the following dosages :<5 years, 8-10 mg/kg q12 h; >5 years, 8-10 mg/kg, qd for 10 days. The clinical data were collected and analysed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The average age of the enrolled cases was six years and nine months (range, four years, and seven months to eleven years and seven months). All cases were found to be drug-resistant and were treated with azithromycin combined with antibacterial drugs. Levofloxacin was used in the patient's refractory to macrolide antibiotics. The temperature of five cases returned to normal 1-2 days after treatment with levofloxacin, and the imaging of the four cases showed expected improvements. The gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological manifestations, joint symptoms, blood parameters, liver and kidney functions, and exercise conditions of the children were closely monitored.

METHOD: A total of 430 patients with MPP were enrolled between January 2015 and December 2015 and divided into a general MPP (GMPP) group (n = 306) and a RMPP group (n = 124). Clinical data, D-D level, white blood cell (WBC) count, proportion of neutrophils (N%), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of RMPP. RESULTS: (1) Hospitalization time, preadmission fever duration, total fever duration, WBC, N %, CRP, LDH, ESR, ALT, AST, and D-D were significantly higher in the RMPP group than those in the GMPP group (all P < 0.05). (2) Correlation analysis showed that D-D was positively correlated with WBC, CRP, ESR, and LDH, and could be used to jointly evaluate the severity of the disease. (3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified preadmission fever duration, CRP, LDH and DD as independent risk factors for RMPP (all P < 0. 05). D-D had the highest predictive power for RMPP (P < 0.01). The D-D level also had a good ability to predict pleural effusion and liver injury (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum D-D levels were significantly increased in patients with RMPP, indicating that excessive inflammatory response and vascular endothelial injury with prolonged duration existed in this patient population. Increased levels of serum D-D may be used as an early predictor of RMPP and the occurrence of complications. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the early diagnosis of RMPP, early intervention and excessive inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma."

There is a growing recognition of the impact of critical-illness-induced immunoparesis on the pathogenesis of VAP, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We hypothesised that, because of limitations in their routine detection, Mycoplasmataceae are more prevalent among patients with VAP than previously recognised, and that these organisms potentially impair immune cell function. METHODS AND SETTING: 159 patients were recruited from 12 UK ICUs. All patients had suspected VAP and underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). VAP was defined as growth of organisms at &gt;10(4) colony forming units per ml of BAL fluid on conventional culture. Samples were tested for Mycoplasmataceae (Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp.) by PCR, and positive samples underwent sequencing for speciation. 36 healthy donors underwent BAL for comparison. Additionally, healthy donor monocytes and macrophages were exposed to Mycoplasma salivarium and their ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide and undertake phagocytosis was assessed. RESULTS: Mycoplasmataceae were found in 49% (95% CI 33% to 65%) of patients with VAP, compared with 14% (95% CI 9% to 25%) of patients without VAP. Patients with sterile BAL fluid had a similar prevalence to healthy donor BAL fluid (10% (95% CI 4% to 20%) vs 8% (95% CI 2% to 22%)). The most common organism identified was M. salivarium. Blood monocytes from healthy volunteers incubated with M. salivarium displayed an impaired TNF-alpha response to lipopolysaccharide (p=0.0003), as did monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (p=0.024). MDM exposed to M. salivarium demonstrated impaired phagocytosis (p=0.005). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of Mycoplasmataceae among patients with VAP, with a markedly lower prevalence among patients with suspected VAP in whom subsequent cultures refuted the diagnosis. The most common organism found, M. salivarium, is able to alter the functions of key immune cells. Mycoplasmataceae may contribute to VAP pathogenesis."

Adults who underwent lung transplantation between July 2017 and August 2019 had prospective surveillance testing for Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma using PCR on post-operative bronchoscopy samples. 159 patients underwent lung transplantation during the study period. Mean age was 54 (+-13) years; baseline diseases were predominantly pulmonary fibrosis (37.7%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (35.8%). Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma airway positivity was found in 42 (26.4%) of tested patients, represented mostly by M. salivarium (26/43; 60.4%), U. parvum (7/43; 16.2%) and U. urealyticum (5/43; 11.6%). Median peak ammonia levels were higher in those with Ureaplasma colonization compared to uncolonized patients (p=0.04) however only three patients developed HS. Recipient airway Ureaplasma-positivity was independently associated with younger (aOR 0.94, 95%CI 0.88-0.99, p=0.04) and female donors (aOR 4.29; 95%CI 1.01-18.2, p=0.05)."

Mycoplasma DNA was detected in specimens from 12 of 84 patients. Of the 107 specimens tested, 13 and seven positive PCR results were obtained with the genus- and species-specific oligonucleotide primers used, respectively, in two different steps. With the latter, one sample was positive for U. urealyticum plus M. hominis, another for M. fermentans plus M. salivarium, and five others were positive for M. salivarium. The unexpected detection of U. urealyticum DNA in respiratory secretions from an adult AIDS patient suggested that this urogenital mycoplasma could have a role in determining or exacerbating respiratory tract infections in the HIV-positive population, but that its low rate of isolation could be related to the frequent failure of methods used currently to detect mycoplasmas."

Serious complications in scrub typhus were more common in the past 4 years than reported previously. Between August 1993 and July 1997, 33 cases of scrub typhus were admitted at Tri-Service General Hospital. Symptoms and signs were: fever (100%), chills (39%), cough (24%), headache (21%), diarrhea (18%), dyspnea (18%), eschar (60%), adenopathy (33%), and rash (21%). Nineteen percent (6/32) had obvious leukopenia (WBC &lt; 4000/ mm3), 34% (11/32) had leukocytosis(WBC &gt; 10,000/mm3) and 44% (14/32) had thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3). Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were 81% (26/32) and 75% (24/32), respectively. Serious complications included pneumonitis 36% (12/33), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 15% (5/33), acute renal failure 9% (3/33), myocarditis 3% (1/33) and septic shock 3% (1/33). One patient died of ARDS due to delay in diagnosis. Other patients recovered after appropriate antibiotic and intensive supportive treatments. Emerging virulent strains of O. tsutsugamushi in Taiwan might be biologically plausible. Scrub typhus should be considered in a patient with fever, varying degree of respiratory distress, particularly if there is an eschar or a history of environmental exposure in endemic areas. Prompt diagnosis, timely antimicrobial therapy and intensive supportive care are important for ARDS and other life-threatening complications."

We studied consecutive febrile adults presenting to a general hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Of the 876 patients enrolled, enteric fever and pneumonia were the most common clinical diagnoses. Putative pathogens were identified in 323 (37%) patients, the most common being Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A (117), Rickettsia typhi (97), Streptococcus pneumoniae (53), Leptospira spp. (36), and Orientia tsutsugamushi (28). Approximately half of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. No clinical predictors were identified to reliably distinguish between the different infections. These findings confirm the heavy burden of enteric fever and pneumonia in Kathmandu, and highlight the importance of murine typhus, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis. Given the lack of reliable clinical predictors, the development of cheap and accurate diagnostic tests are likely to be of great clinical utility in this setting."

The main pathologic change is focal or disseminated vasculitis caused by the destruction of endothelial cells and the perivascular infiltration of leukocytes. The diagnosis of scrub typhus is based on the patient's history of exposure, clinical features, and results of serologic testing. Regional and generalized lymphadenopathy is common. The pulmonary manifestations of scrub typhus include interstitial pneumonia, interstitial edema, and hemorrhage caused by vasculitis. Abdominal manifestations include splenomegaly, periportal edema, gallbladder wall thickening, and lymphadenopathy. Although the severity of scrub typhus varies considerably, involvement of the central nervous system is seen in almost all patients and can result in meningoencephalitis. A high degree of clinical suspicion and familiarity with the various radiologic manifestations of scrub typhus allow early diagnosis and timely initiation of appropriate therapy, and thereby may help reduce patient morbidity."

Pneumonia occurs as a complication of scrub typhus in the late-phase disease. However, pneumonia may also occur as a presenting manifestation of O. tsutsugamushi infection. We reviewed the cases of 3 patients with atypical pneumonia who presented at our hospital and were later confirmed to have O. tsutsugamushi infection by serology, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cell culture. All patients were young adults with no history of scrub typhus, and none claimed to have recently been exposed to areas where scrub typhus is endemic. Two cases occurred in non-outbreak seasons. Furthermore, eschar was not observed. Pneumonia was documented within 4 days after fever onset. The immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody titers against O. tsutsugamushi were higher than the IgM titers, although the serologic test results were less helpful in the diagnosis. Nested PCR and cell culture of blood specimens confirmed the diagnosis of O. tsutsugamushi infection.

The present study was conducted to determine the seasonality, clinical presentation and predictors of mortality in patients with scrub typhus at a tertiary care teaching hospital in northern India. METHODS: Scrub typhus was suspected in patients attending the hospital as per the standard case definition and serological evidence was obtained by performing an IgM ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 284 patients with scrub typhus from urban and rural areas were seen, predominantly from July to November. The most common clinical presentation was a bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which resembled pneumonia due to atypical pathogens and often progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) or a febrile illness associated with altered sensorium, aseptic meningitis, shock, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding or jaundice was also seen. Eschars were seen in 17 per cent of patients, and thrombocytopenia, transaminitis and azotaemia were frequent. There were 24 deaths (8.5%) caused predominantly by ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction. The mortality in patients with ARDS was high (37%). ARDS [odds ratio (OR)=38.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.93, 147.71] and acute kidney injury (OR=8.30, 95% CI: 2.21, 31.21) were the major predictors of death. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that scrub typhus may be considered a cause of CAP, ARDS, AUFI or a febrile illness with multisystem involvement, in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, especially from July to November.

It is the most common re-emerging Rickettsial infection in India and many other South East Asian countries. In fact, scrub typhus is confined geographically to the Asia Pacific region, a billion people are at risk and nearly a million cases are reported every year. Scrub typhus appears particularly to be distributed in the tsutsugamushi triangle which is distributed over a very wide area of 13 million km2 bound by Japan in the east, through China, the Philippines, tropical Australia in the south, and west through India, Pakistan, possibly to Tibet to Afghanistan, and southern parts of the USSR in the north. Eschar is the characteristic lesion that starts as a vesicular lesion at the site of mite feeding. Later, an ulcer forms with black necrotic center and an erythematous border along with regional lymphadenopathy. Other features are fever, maculopapular rash starting from the trunk, and spreading to the limbs. It may affect the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, renal, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. Serious complication in the form of myocarditis, pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and even acute respiratory distress syndrome may develop. Tetracycline or chloramphenicol remains the main stay of therapy."

However, the history is further prolonged. The book Dong Ui Bo Gam, published in 1613, described ""Soo Dok"" (water poisoning), which is similar to tsutsugamushi disease. Further, the term was mentioned in the book Hyang Yak Gu Geup Bang, first published in 1232-1251. During the Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945), Trombicula akamushi was identified in Suwon, Korea, in 1917. Although cases of tsutsugamushi disease in Korea with a murine typhus-like illness and OXK-positivity were reported in 1935, such atypical presentation was not recognized as tsutsugamushi disease. During the Korean War, in 1951, tsutsugamushi disease developed in two British soldiers stationed in the Imjin River, who presented typical features and positive OXK reactions. Indigenous cases have re-emerged since 1986. Thereafter, there were many studies on various aspects of tsutsugamushi disease: epidemiology, vector, small mammals, clinical features and complications, diagnosis, and treatment. Persistence of Orientia tsutsugamushi and its possible recrudescence with pneumonia were reported in 2012 and 2014, respectively."

However, there is limited data on lung involvement of SFTS. Therefore, the present study investigated the chest radiographic findings of SFTS, including computed tomography (CT), and compared these with those of scrub typhus, which is the most common tick-borne illness in South Korea and share risk factors and occur in similar settings.Medical records of patients with confirmed SFTS and scrub typhus in a tertiary hospital in Seoul (South Korea), between January 2014 and June 2018, were reviewed. Initial chest radiography and CT were reviewed by 2 experienced radiologists.A total of 39 patients with SFTS and 101 patients with scrub typhus were analyzed. All patients except 3 patients with scrub typhus in both groups received chest radiography. Cardiomegaly (90%) and patchy consolidation with ground glass opacity (GGO) pattern (31%) were more common in SFTS group than scrub typhus group (20%, P &lt; .001 and 2%, P &lt; .001, respectively). About half of each group received chest CT. Consolidation (29%) and pericardial effusion (24%) were more common in SFTS group than scrub typhus group (6%, P = .02 and 4%, P = .008, respectively).

This study sought to characterize the epidemiology of human rickettsioses amongst patients hospitalized with fever at 8 tertiary hospitals in Indonesia. METHODS: Acute and convalescent blood from 975 hospitalized non-dengue patients was tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by ELISA. Specimens from cases with seroconversion or increasing IgM and/or IgG titers were tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by IFA and Rickettsia genomes using primers for Rickettsia (R.) sp, R. typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Testing was performed retrospectively on stored specimens; results did not inform patient management. RESULTS: R. typhi, R. rickettsii, and O. tsutsugamushi IgG antibodies were identified in 269/872 (30.8%), 36/634 (5.7%), and 19/504 (3.8%) of samples, respectively. For the 103/975 (10.6%) non-dengue patients diagnosed with acute rickettsial infection, presenting symptoms included nausea (72%), headache (69%), vomiting (43%), lethargy (33%), anorexia (32%), arthralgia (30%), myalgia (28%), chills (28%), epigastric pain (28%), and rash (17%).

Serious complications are not uncommon and multiorgan dysfunction may develop leading to death. Paucity of data on the clinical spectrum and determinants of aftermath may be contributing to higher mortality in the region. A prospective study was done to describe the spectrum of organ dysfunction in serologically confirmed cases of scrub typhus and document predictors of adverse outcomes. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in patients diagnosed to have scrub typhus by IgM ELISA. The clinical features, investigations and complications among survivors were statistically compared to those in the deceased. Fisher's exact test, t-test and logistic regression have been applied where appropriate. RESULTS: The study population comprised of 123 patients.

INVESTIGATIONS: Stool, sputum and urine cultures were negative. The chest radiogram showed bilateral mild interstitial infiltration. Antibody titres against Rickettsia tsutsugamushi were markedly raised (IgG 1:128, IgM 1:2048). DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Empirical antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin (200 mg twice daily intravenously) had no effect. As the mild signs of interstitial pneumonia progressed, clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily orally) was substituted with rapid fall in fever and gradual improvement. Tsutsugamushi infection was diagnosed serologically and the antibiotic changed to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily orally), continued for 14 days. Full remission occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Tsutsugamushi fever should be included in the differential diagnosis if, in addition to a history of a visit to an endemic area, there is the clinical triad of skin necrosis at the site of a mite bite, regional lymphadenopathy and skin rash (in this case, no skin lesion).

In the 1970s, no cases of murine typhus were diagnosed in Tunisia. METHODS: The clinico-epidemiological characteristics of seven cases of murine typhus diagnosed at our hospitals since 1993 are reported. Diagnosis was confirmed by indirect fluorescence assay detecting specific R. typhi antibodies. RESULTS: Murine typhus occurred in all ages from 18-80 years during the hot season in rural areas. Clinical features were: sudden onset of fever and absence of eschar in all cases, with maculo-papular rash (five cases), prostration (four cases), meningism (three cases) and pneumonia (four cases). Frequent laboratory findings were moderate thrombopenia (four cases) and elevated transaminases (four cases). Before the results of serology, clinical diagnoses were Mediterranean Spotted Fever (four cases), Q fever (one case), pneumonia (one case), and lymphocytic meningitis (one case). Serology confirmed all diagnoses with cross-reactivity with Rickettsia conorii. CONCLUSION: Murine typhus exists in Tunisia and its prevalence is underestimated.

In such cases, a correct anamnesis of the patient is basic to clarify which pathogens might have produced the infection. For this reason, health professionals including veterinarians and laboratory personnel working with zoonotic pathogens should keep their doctors informed. CASE PRESENTATION: A human case of atypical pneumonia linked to Chlamydia abortus is reported. A 47-year-old male, a veterinarian researcher into chlamydiae, developed respiratory symptoms, breathing problems and high fever. Serological analyses ruled out the involvement of several respiratory pathogens, such as M. pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Rickettsia conorii and C. pneumoniae, and Chlamydia abortus was identified as the possible aetiological agent of the infection. The isolation of C. abortus from the patient's sputum and subsequent molecular analysis confirmed the presence of this microorganism. CONCLUSION: As far as we know, although C. abortus has not been previously described as capable of causing pneumonia in humans, this is the first reported case of atypical pneumonia in which C. abortus is thought to have played an aetiological role."

We describe a patient with rapidly progressing ARDS and myocarditis secondary to spotted fever caused by Rickettsia conorii. ARDS and myocarditis are rare complications of Rickettsia conorii infections and only a few cases are reported to date. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53 years old manual worker presented with fever for 5 days and a skin rash. He was in circulatory failure on admission and developed severe hypoxaemia with gross changes in chest radiograph by next day requiring assisted ventilation. He had myocarditis causing left ventricular failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was confirmed to have spotted fever rickettsial infection with rising titre of indirect immunofluorescence antibodies to Ricketssia conorii and made a complete recovery with appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care. CONCLUSION: Rickettsial infections can present with diverse manifestations. Even the patients with severe organ involvements such as myocarditis and ARDS can be completely cured if timely identified and treated.

This study was a prospective observational cohort study of all adult cases with confirmed MSF treated in a teaching hospital (1984-2015) to compare the characteristics of elderly patients (&gt; 65 years) with younger adults. We identified 263 adult patients with MSF, and 53 (20.2%) were elderly. Severe MSF was more frequent in the elderly (26.4% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.002). Gastrointestinal symptoms, impaired consciousness, lung infiltrate, oedema, acute hearing loss, raised alanine transaminase, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in elderly patients, and arthromyalgia occurred less frequently. Most patients were treated with a single-day doxycycline regimen (two oral doses of 200 mg for 1 day). All patients recovered uneventfully. Fever disappeared 2.55 +- 1.16 days after treatment initiation in elderly patients, and the remaining symptoms disappeared after 3.65 +- 1.42 days. These figures were similar to non-elderly patients. Severe MSF was more frequent in elderly patients. Some clinical manifestations occurred with different frequencies in the elderly compared with younger patients. Single-day doxycycline therapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MSF in elderly patients."

IgG and/or IgM to Rickettsia conorii were detected in 145 sera from 130 patients, and antibodies to R. sibirica (group-specific) were detected in 143 sera from 145. Antibodies to R. conorii were detected for 71,4% patients with Astrakhan spotted fever (ASF), for 28,4% patients with acute respiratory viral infection, for 19,1% patients with infection of unspecified etiology and for 40% patients having symptoms of a adenovirus infection. Acute rickettsiosis, provably ASF, is serologically validated for 71 patients. Dynamic of IgM/IgG to R. conorii in sera of patients having different preliminary diagnoses is discussed. IgM to R. conorii in sera of patients having adenovirus infection symptoms were detected at a later time as compared with others. For regions of high risk of R. conorii subsp. caspia infection the differentiation of diagnostic and anamnestic specific antibodies is very important. The absence of serological and molecular biological markers in third of patients with ASF symptoms is necessary to study.

The spotted fever group (SFG) and typhus group (TG) are major RDs, which are commonly caused by Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia typhi, respectively. The limited availability and role of serological tests in the acute phase of illness warrants rapid reliable molecular methods for diagnosis and epidemiological studies. Two hundred patients with AFI in whom the routine fever diagnostics were negative, were enrolled over a period of two months (April 2019 to May 2019). DNA was extracted and in-house nested PCR using primers specific for both SPG and TG pathogens was used. The positive amplified products were sequenced for species identification and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA 7.0.14 software (iGEM, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA). The demographic details of the RD cases were documented. The prevalence of RD among AFI cases was 7% (14/200); SFG and TG were identified as the cause in 4% and 3% of AFI cases, respectively. The median age of the RD cases was 22 years (range 2-65). The median duration of fever was 3 days (range 1-12). The RD cases presented with respiratory symptoms or signs (44.44%), jaundice (22.22%), abdominal pain (22.22%), diarrhea (22.22), vesicular rash (11.11%), vomiting (11.11%), loss of appetite (11.11%), headache (11.11%), leukocytosis (88.88% with mean count 22,750/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (33.33%). The cases were treated empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam (66.66%), clindamycin (44.44%), cefotaxime (33.33%), meropenem (33.33%), metronidazole (33.33%), doxycycline (22.22%), azithromycin (22.22%), ceftriaxone (11.11%), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (11.11%). The mortality among the RD cases was 11.11%. The present pilot study shows that RD is not an uncommon cause of AFI in north India. The febrile episodes are usually transient, not severe and associated with heterogenous clinical presentation without documented history of tick exposure in the hospitalized patients. The transient, non-severe, febrile illness could be due to transient rickettsemia resulting from empirical antimicrobial therapy as the rickettsial organisms are expected to be more susceptible to higher doses of beta-lactam antibiotics.

We studied consecutive febrile adults presenting to a general hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Of the 876 patients enrolled, enteric fever and pneumonia were the most common clinical diagnoses. Putative pathogens were identified in 323 (37%) patients, the most common being Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A (117), Rickettsia typhi (97), Streptococcus pneumoniae (53), Leptospira spp. (36), and Orientia tsutsugamushi (28). Approximately half of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. No clinical predictors were identified to reliably distinguish between the different infections. These findings confirm the heavy burden of enteric fever and pneumonia in Kathmandu, and highlight the importance of murine typhus, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis. Given the lack of reliable clinical predictors, the development of cheap and accurate diagnostic tests are likely to be of great clinical utility in this setting."

In the 1970s, no cases of murine typhus were diagnosed in Tunisia. METHODS: The clinico-epidemiological characteristics of seven cases of murine typhus diagnosed at our hospitals since 1993 are reported. Diagnosis was confirmed by indirect fluorescence assay detecting specific R. typhi antibodies. RESULTS: Murine typhus occurred in all ages from 18-80 years during the hot season in rural areas. Clinical features were: sudden onset of fever and absence of eschar in all cases, with maculo-papular rash (five cases), prostration (four cases), meningism (three cases) and pneumonia (four cases). Frequent laboratory findings were moderate thrombopenia (four cases) and elevated transaminases (four cases). Before the results of serology, clinical diagnoses were Mediterranean Spotted Fever (four cases), Q fever (one case), pneumonia (one case), and lymphocytic meningitis (one case). Serology confirmed all diagnoses with cross-reactivity with Rickettsia conorii. CONCLUSION: Murine typhus exists in Tunisia and its prevalence is underestimated. Further, more specific studies are needed to evaluate the true prevalence."

We started treatment with ciprofloxacin. After 48 hours of treatment the diarrhea subsided, whereas the rush on his trunk increased. Under the suspicion of rickettsial fever we started doxycycline 200 mg/d. Because of an incipient pneumonia we added ceftriaxon. The patient improved rapidly and the laboratory abnormalities resolved. Serological investigations revealed a significant increase of specific antibodies against Rickettsia typhi.

It is difficult to diagnose because of its non-specific clinical manifestations. Our objective was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment features of murine typhus. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 73 adult patients hospitalized for murine typhus from 2006 to 2011. The diagnosis was confirmed by a single titer of IgM&gt;=128 or by seroconversion to typhus group antigen identified by indirect fluorescent assay. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 33.1 years (range, 13-68 years). Thirty-eight patients (52%) lived in rural or suburban areas; neither fleabites nor exposure to rats were reported. The most common clinical symptoms were: fever, headache, and myalgia. A maculopapular and non-confluent rash was observed in 47 patients (64.4%). No inoculation eschar was observed in any patient. Eight patients presented with interstitial pneumonia and two with lymphocytic meningitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by indirect fluorescence assay in every case. A single titer of IgM &gt;= 128 was found in 62 (84.9%) cases. The other 11 cases were diagnosed by seroconversion. All patients were given antibiotics. Tetracyclines were prescribed in 57 cases (78%). The two patients presenting with meningitis were treated with fluoroquinolone. The outcome was favorable for all patients and no relapse was observed.

Although flea-borne typhus is no longer nationally notifiable, cases are reported for surveillance purposes in a few U.S. states. The infection is typically self-limiting, but may be severe or life-threatening in some patients. We performed a retrospective review of confirmed or probable cases of fatal flea-borne typhus reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services during 1985-2015. When available, medical charts were also examined. Eleven cases of fatal flea-borne typhus were identified. The median patient age was 62 years (range, 36-84 years) and 8 (73%) were male. Patients presented most commonly with fever (100%), nausea and vomiting (55%), and rash (55%). Respiratory (55%) and neurologic (45%) manifestations were also identified frequently. Laboratory abnormalities included thrombocytopenia (82%) and elevated hepatic transaminases (63%). Flea or animal contact before illness onset was frequently reported (55%). The median time from hospitalization to administration of a tetracycline-class drug was 4 days (range, 0-5 days). The median time from symptom onset to death was 14 days (range, 1-34 days). Flea-borne typhus can be a life-threatening disease if not treated in a timely manner with appropriate tetracycline-class antibiotics. Flea-borne typhus should be considered in febrile patients with animal or flea exposure and respiratory or neurologic symptoms of unknown etiology."

It typically causes a mild illness with symptoms of fever, rash, headache, chills, and non-specific gastrointestinal complaints. However, there have been no reported cases in the literature of murine typhus infection causing symptoms of acute psychosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A 30-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and chronic pain syndrome presented to the emergency department with altered mental state and fever. She developed vivid visual hallucinations, DIC, and hypoxia with pulmonary opacities, ultimately requiring intubation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leptomeningeal enhancement with unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. Serum murine typhus serology came back positive. Doxycycline therapy was initiated, which resulted in complete patient recovery. This case shows that murine typhus infection may present with acute psychosis and can mimic DIC, leading to diagnostic confusion. MRI sequences may show leptomeningeal enhancement, which has never been reported before in patients with typhus. Early neurological imaging using advanced MRI sequences for patients presenting with altered sensorium, visual hallucinations, and symptoms similar to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) may help with early diagnosis, decreased hospital stay, and better prognosis."

Murine typhus is identified worldwide, predominantly in tropical and subtropical geographic locations. Transmission occurs through direct inoculation by an arthropod vector, most commonly the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. rickettsial infections are notorious for disseminated infections throughout the endothelial cells. The increase in permeability is an immediate consequence and has the potential of leading to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, otherwise known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinical manifestations are non-specific and initially mimic typical viral etiologies, obscuring early diagnosis. As a result, clinicians often do not include rickettsial infections in their differential diagnoses. Definitive diagnosis is based on clinical recognition, epidemiologic awareness, and serological testing. Here we present a confirmed case of murine typhus in a young non-immunocompromised patient who developed ARDS one week from the initial onset of symptoms."

This study sought to characterize the epidemiology of human rickettsioses amongst patients hospitalized with fever at 8 tertiary hospitals in Indonesia. METHODS: Acute and convalescent blood from 975 hospitalized non-dengue patients was tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by ELISA. Specimens from cases with seroconversion or increasing IgM and/or IgG titers were tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by IFA and Rickettsia genomes using primers for Rickettsia (R.) sp, R. typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Testing was performed retrospectively on stored specimens; results did not inform patient management. RESULTS: R. typhi, R. rickettsii, and O. tsutsugamushi IgG antibodies were identified in 269/872 (30.8%), 36/634 (5.7%), and 19/504 (3.8%) of samples, respectively. For the 103/975 (10.6%) non-dengue patients diagnosed with acute rickettsial infection, presenting symptoms included nausea (72%), headache (69%), vomiting (43%), lethargy (33%), anorexia (32%), arthralgia (30%), myalgia (28%), chills (28%), epigastric pain (28%), and rash (17%).

The disease occurs worldwide but is likely underrecognized due to its non-specific symptoms, causing significant morbidity. A systematic review found disease complications in one-fourth of all patients and a long fever duration in those untreated. Although mortality in treated cases is estimated to be very low, some case series have shown a notably higher mortality in untreated patients. This study aimed to describe the outcomes and estimate the mortality of untreated murine typhus through a comprehensive systematic literature review. We systematically searched the literature for articles describing untreated murine typhus patients, excluding cases with no laboratory assay confirmed diagnosis, those who received efficacious treatment, had incomplete information on primary outcome and articles describing less than 10 patients and performed a narrative synthesis of the study findings. The study protocol followed the PRISMA guidelines and was part of a more extensive protocol registered at PROSPERO (CRD42018101991). Twelve studies including a total of 239 untreated patients matched the eligibility criteria. Only a single study reported one death in 28 patients, giving a patient series mortality of 3.6% and an overall mortality of 0.4% in 239 untreated patients. Complications were reported in 10 of the 12 studies and included involvement of the central nervous system, kidney and lung, with a hospitalisation rate of 70% and ICU admission rate of 27% in one study. The mean duration of fever in untreated patients was 15 days in two and 12.7 days in one study. Although the untreated mortality in this study was low, the sample size was small. Murine typhus caused significant morbidity when untreated, leading to high hospitalisation rates and highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of this neglected disease to reduce disease burden and health-care related costs."

We investigated the role of T. whipplei in febrile patients from rural Senegal who had a negative test result for malaria. METHODS: From November 2008 through July 2009, we conducted a prospective study in 2 Senegalese villages; 204 blood specimens from febrile patients were collected. DNA extraction of whole-blood samples collected by finger pricks with a lancet stick was performed in Senegal; elution and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for T. whipplei were performed in France. In April 2009, we conducted a screening to look for the presence of T. whipplei in the saliva and stools of the overall population. Blood from French patients with chronic T. whipplei in stool samples was also analyzed. RESULTS: The presence of T. whipplei DNA was detected in blood from 13 (6.4%) of 204 tested patients, mostly in children and in December and January. None of the French carriers tested positive. The patients with T. whipplei bacteremia presented with fever (13 patients), cough (10), thirst (8), fatigue (7), rhinorrhea (6), and sleep disorders (5). Cough and sleep disorders were significantly more frequent in febrile carriers than in the 191 febrile episodes without T. whipplei bacteremia (P = .002 and .005, respectively).

We performed a case-control study including patients with T. whipplei in bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) and controls in order to compare patients' clinical statuses. We tested T. whipplei PCR from January 2013 to December 2014, in all the 1438 BALs in Marseille, France. Controls were hospitalized in the same unit during the same period and were comparable in age and sex. Eighty-eight BALs (6.1%) were positive for T. whipplei and 58 patients had pneumonia. Sixty-four patients were male with a mean age of 50.5 years. T. whipplei was commonly associated with aspiration pneumonia (18/88 patients compared with 6/88 controls, p 0.01) and was detected as a unique pathogen in nine cases. Overall, no difference was observed regarding immunocompromised status. Nevertheless, the six AIDS-infected patients in the T. whipplei group had a significantly lower CD4 level than the five AIDS-infected patients in the control group (49 vs. 320/mm3, p 0.01); in addition, five patients were treated with tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (including three treated by monocolonal antibodies and two with soluble receptor) compared with none of the controls (p 0.03). Pneumocystis jirovecii was frequently associated with the T. whipplei group (7/88 vs. 0/88 in control group), Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only detected in the control group (8/88). This study adds evidence for a causative role of T. whipplei in pneumonia. In the future, an experimental model of pneumonia induced by T. whipplei will prove its role in pneumonia."

Despite effective antiretroviral therapy, bacterial pneumonia (the most frequently occurring HIV-associated pulmonary illness) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the HIV-infected population. Over the last few decades, studies have looked at the role of atypical bacterial pneumonia (i.e. pneumonia that causes an atypical clinical presentation or responds differently to typical therapeutics) in association with HIV infection. Due to the lack of available diagnostic strategies, the lack of consideration, and the declining immunity of the patient, HIV co-infections with atypical bacteria are currently believed to be underreported. Thus, following an extensive database search, this review aimed to highlight the current knowledge and gaps regarding atypical bacterial pneumonia in HIV. The authors discuss the prevalence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Legionella species and others in the HIV-infected population as well as their clinical presentation, methods of detection, and treatment. Further studies looking at the role of these microbes in association with HIV are required. Increased knowledge of these atypical bacteria will lead to a more rapid diagnosis of these infections, resulting in an improved quality of life for the HIV-infected population."

Grocott and periodic acid-Schiff staining were positive. Fungal and Tropheryma whipplei PCR were, however, negative. Further identification was needed. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) extraction was performed using an FFPE extraction kit. T. whipplei was searched for using a real-time PCR targeting the noncoding repeat specific for T. whipplei. Identification of the bacteria in the extract was done using 16S rDNA and 23S rDNA sequencing and BLAST analysis. Internal transcribed spacer PCR was used for fungal DNA identification. RESULTS: The FFPE extract was negative for fungi and T. whipplei. 16S rDNA sequence analysis of a 1375 bp fragment gave T. whipplei as the best match with 26 mismatches, resulting in only 98% agreement. Sequence analysis of the 23S rDNA gene again gave T. whipplei as the best match, but with only 91% agreement. A pan-Tropheryma 16S rDNA real-time PCR was developed, and both the biopsy sample and a respiratory sample of the patient were strongly positive. The patient received antimicrobial treatment targeting T. whipplei with good clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: 16S and 23S rDNA sequencing gave T. whipplei as the best hit, although with limited agreement. These findings suggest that a novel Tropheryma species that lacks the noncoding repeat, most frequently used for molecular detection of Whipple disease, might be the cause of the pulmonary disease. Adaptation of current PCR protocols is warranted in order to detect all Tropheryma species."

The impact of T. whipplei colonization in the lung on local inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals is currently unknown. In this study, we performed specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing for T. whipplei in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and induced sputum (IS) samples in 76 HIV-infected participants from three clinical sites. Pulmonary function and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in BAL were measured. Frequency of T. whipplei in either BAL or IS was 43.4%. The sensitivity and specificity of IS compared to BAL for detection of T. whipplei was 92.3% and 84.2%, respectively, and isolates of T. whipplei in the BAL and IS in the same subject shared genetic identity. Pulmonary function measures were not associated with T. whipplei colonization, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in BAL and plasma as well as percentages of inflammatory cells in BAL and IS were not higher in colonized individuals. Overall, these results indicate that T. whipplei colonization in the lung is common, but may not be associated with decreased pulmonary function or inflammation in HIV-infected individuals."

However, when patients do not respond to supplemental intensive treatments they should be closely followed because they can hide other pathological conditions. We present the case of a 47-year-old man with morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI]: 48 kg/m2) who underwent bariatric surgery. In 2016, he presented severe pneumonia and hospitalization at the Intensive Unit Care was required. After this episode, his nutritional state impaired, presenting 6-7 diarrhea/steatorrhea events per-day and requiring several hospitalizations due to the persistence of severe hypoproteinemia. He was given parenteral high-protein associated with low-fat oral diet. He presented a temporary biochemical improvement, but the hypoproteinemia recurred. Finally, tests revealed the presence of Tropheryma whipplei as protein-losing enteropathy. Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare cause of diarrhea and malnutrition, and these symptoms can be confused with the postoperative status of malabsorptive bariatric techniques.

Here we report the clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients suffering from Whipple disease (WD) and evaluate the impact of these molecular techniques. METHODS: Patients with a positive PCR for T. whipplei between 2001 and 2016 were retrospectively collected from microbiological databases. Two infectious diseases specialists reviewed their medical records and classified them as definite WD, probable WD or carriage of T. whipplei without disease. RESULTS: 1153 samples were tested for T. whipplei, 76 samples taken from 36 patients were positive. Fifteen were considered as presenting a definite WD, seven as a probable WD, and 14 as carriers. Median age was 56.4 years (extremes: 6.6-76.1). Median time from symptoms to diagnosis was 3 years (2.5 months to 13.3 years). About 60% were immunosuppressed. The most frequent clinical presentations were joint pain (16/22), weight loss (15/22) and/or digestive tract disorder (15/22), 41% had neurological manifestations, 32% pulmonary involvement, and 32% lymphadenopathies. Bacterial load in faeces or saliva were 88'425 copies/ml (IQR 6'175-292'725) in definite and probable WD and 311 copies/ml (IQR 253-2'090) in carriers, respectively. We observed a 90% PPV above 32'200 copies/ml in faeces. CONCLUSIONS: WD is a chronic multisytemic disease with frequent pulmonary involvement. Underlying immunodeficiency is commonly observed leading to more complex clinical presentation. Positive T. whipplei PCR in both stool and saliva has a high PPV. Moreover, patients with WD present higher bacterial load in faeces with a threshold of > 32'200 copies/ml predicting ongoing infection."

In this report, we characterize the lung pathology and expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) associated with U. urealyticum pneumonia in very low-birth weight infants (VLBW; &lt; or =1500 g). Lung pathology of archived autopsy specimens was retrospectively reviewed in three groups of VLBW infants: 5 gestational controls who died from nonpulmonary causes, 13 infants with pneumonia who were culture and/or PCR negative for U. urealyticum, and 5 infants with pulmonary disease and positive for U. urealyticum by tracheal aspirate and/or lung tissue culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence and extent of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, as well as interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis were evaluated. PCR was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. Additional sections were immunostained for TNF-alpha. The peripheral total white blood cell counts and absolute neutrophil counts were three-fold higher in infants with U. urealyticum pneumonia than cell counts in infants infected with other organisms. There was a trend toward a predominance of neutrophils in alveoli of non- Ureaplasma pneumonia infants, but a trend toward a predominance of alveolar macrophages in U. urealyticum-infected infants. The most striking finding was the presence of increased interstitial fibrosis in all Ureaplasma-infected infants. TNF-alpha immunoreactive cell density was very low in the gestational controls, but increased in both pneumonia groups. We conclude that persistent lung U. urealyticum infection may contribute to chronic inflammation and early fibrosis in the preterm lung."

From infants ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome, 6 (gestation, 28 wk; birthweight, 880 g) were positive for U. urealyticum and 11 (25 wk, 800 g) were negative.

U. urealyticum was very weakly detectable in two infants on d 1 but was detected in five of six infants at d 10. Furthermore, pulmonary neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and IL-1beta on d 10 and IL-6 and IL-8 at d 1 were significantly increased in the positive group. A variety of organisms were identified in six samples between 14 and 21 d of age, but all samples were negative for group B streptococci.

It may be transmitted perinatally from the colonized mother to her offspring, often resulting in prematurity and neonatal disease. The microorganism also sustains a causative role for infectious diseases in older children. RECENT FINDINGS: U. urealyticum infection can be diagnosed by culture, polymerase chain reaction, and the detection of specific antibodies. Neonatal infection has been implicated in various pathological conditions including pneumonia, chronic lung disease, central nervous system disorders, sepsis, osteomyelitis and even death. Older children may present with wheezing, pneumonitis, pertussis-like syndrome and different forms of arthritis. Large well-designed trials have demonstrated that the regular administration of antibiotics to vaginally colonized women are not beneficial in terms of preventing preterm labour. Macrolide-containing antibiotic regimens are, however, recommended for preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Erythromycin treatment of ureaplasma respiratory colonized premature infants shows no reduction in the incidence of chronic lung disease. Treatment of central nervous system infections, sepsis and arthritides includes tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively. SUMMARY: This review covers recent evidence concerning the role of U. urealyticum as a pathogen during childhood. It also includes an evaluation of contemporary diagnostic techniques and optimal therapeutic approaches."

There exists an association between pulmonary infection by Ureaplasma urealyticum and the development of a bronchopulmonary dysplasia especially for premature babies. According to our observations acute exacerbations of severe pneumonia can appear even after month. An attempt of therapy of pulmonary infection should be undertaken with erythromycin, if sensitive serotypes are present.

Data on Ureaplasma meningitis are limited and partly controversially discussed. PATIENT: We report the unique case of a 9-month-old infant with progressive internal hydrocephalus of unknown origin and developmental delay due to a history of&gt;200 days of inflammation of the central nervous system. The female extremely low birth weight infant had been referred to our hospital for ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. She had been born at 26+3 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 940 g. With the exception of a moderate respiratory distress syndrome, postnatal period had been reported uneventful. However, internal hydrocephalus had become manifest at 4 weeks of postnatal age. Intraventricular hemorrhage had not been documented by cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis had repetitively revealed pronounced inflammation reflected by pleocytosis (50-86 leukocytes/muL, 60% lymphocytes), CSF protein levels of 578-1,026 mg/dL and undetectable CSF glucose. Although suggesting bacterial meningitis, microbial diagnostics had not been indicative, and empirical antibiotics had not affected the CSF findings. On admission to our hospital, CSF analysis still documented significant inflammation (125 leukocytes/muL, CSF protein 565 mg/dL, CSF glucose&lt;2 mg/dL). RESULTS: Due to a prenatal history of cerclage, we initiated microbial diagnostics on Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis. U. parvum was detected in CSF by culture and PCR, no other pathogens were isolated. On intravenous treatment with chloramphenicol, CSF profile continuously normalized, and cultures and PCR became negative. Treatment was continued for 3 weeks, and the infant was discharged after uncomplicated ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. During a 12-month observation period she has shown encouraging recovery. CONCLUSION: In preterm infants, in particular, internal hydrocephalus of unknown origin and sustained CSF inflammation are highly suggestive of Ureaplasma meningitis. Our case highlights that infection may escape detection if not explicitly considered, since microbial diagnosis requires complex media and PCR."

","SPECIES:UreaplasmaID:27071419TITLE:Low-pathogenicity Mycoplasma spp. alter human monocyte and macrophage function and are highly prevalent among patients with ventilator-acquired pneumonia.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) remains a significant problem within intensive care units (ICUs). There is a growing recognition of the impact of critical-illness-induced immunoparesis on the pathogenesis of VAP, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We hypothesised that, because of limitations in their routine detection, Mycoplasmataceae are more prevalent among patients with VAP than previously recognised, and that these organisms potentially impair immune cell function. METHODS AND SETTING: 159 patients were recruited from 12 UK ICUs. All patients had suspected VAP and underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). VAP was defined as growth of organisms at &gt;10(4) colony forming units per ml of BAL fluid on conventional culture. Samples were tested for Mycoplasmataceae (Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp.) by PCR, and positive samples underwent sequencing for speciation. 36 healthy donors underwent BAL for comparison. Additionally, healthy donor monocytes and macrophages were exposed to Mycoplasma salivarium and their ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide and undertake phagocytosis was assessed. RESULTS: Mycoplasmataceae were found in 49% (95% CI 33% to 65%) of patients with VAP, compared with 14% (95% CI 9% to 25%) of patients without VAP. Patients with sterile BAL fluid had a similar prevalence to healthy donor BAL fluid (10% (95% CI 4% to 20%) vs 8% (95% CI 2% to 22%)). The most common organism identified was M. salivarium. Blood monocytes from healthy volunteers incubated with M. salivarium displayed an impaired TNF-alpha response to lipopolysaccharide (p=0.0003), as did monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (p=0.024). MDM exposed to M. salivarium demonstrated impaired phagocytosis (p=0.005). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of Mycoplasmataceae among patients with VAP, with a markedly lower prevalence among patients with suspected VAP in whom subsequent cultures refuted the diagnosis. The most common organism found, M. salivarium, is able to alter the functions of key immune cells. Mycoplasmataceae may contribute to VAP pathogenesis."

Acute chorioamnionitis is an inflammation of the placenta associated with miscarriage. We retrospectively evaluated a possible association between genital mycoplasmas detection, acute chorioamnionitis and fetal pneumonia from second and third trimester spontaneous abortions. METHODS: One hundred and thirty placenta and fetal lung samples were evaluated for histological examination. The placenta samples, along with corresponding fetal tracheo-bronchial aspirates, also underwent bacterial and fungal culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of genital mycoplasmas. RESULTS: Acute chorioamnionitis and pneumonia were diagnosed in 80/130 (61.5%) and 22/130 (16.9%) samples, respectively. Among samples positive for acute chorioamnionitis, the proportion of samples positive by real-time PCR and/or culture, was significantly higher than that of negative controls [54/80 (67.5%) vs. 26/80 (32.5%); P&lt;0.001]. Ureaplasma parvum detection was significantly associated with acute chorioamnionitis compared to controls [9/11 (81.8%) vs. 2/11 (18.2%); P=0.019], as well as U. urealyticum [6/7 (85.7%) vs. 1/7 (14.3%); P=0.039]. Among tracheo-bronchial aspirates from abortions with pneumonia, the proportion of real-time PCR and/or culture positive samples was significantly higher than that of controls [13/22 (59.1%) vs. 9/22 (40.9%); P=0.029]. CONCLUSIONS: A strong association was found between acute histologic chorioamnionitis and microbial invasion with U. parvum and/or U. urealyticum."

Ureaplasma urealyticum, an organism not visible on gram stain, not recovered on routine bacteriological media, and not susceptible to antibiotics commonly used to treat neonatal infections, was the single most common organism isolated. 14% of isolates were from infants born by caesarean section with intact membranes, which indicated that infection had occurred in utero. The findings probably represented true infection of the lower respiratory tract because the organism was recovered in pure culture in numbers greater than 10(3) from 85% of the infants, and also from the blood in 26% of infants. Those infants less than or equal to 1000 g with Ureaplasma urealyticum infection of the lower respiratory tract were twice more likely to have chronic lung disease or to die than were infants of similar birth-weight but who were uninfected, or infants greater than 1000 g.

In one, cultures positive for U urealyticum were obtained on multiple occasions from trachea, blood, and pleural fluid prior to the infant's death on postnatal day 6. Autopsy findings confirmed the presence of severe pneumonia and the organism was again recovered from multiple sites. A second infant had no apparent predisposing factors for development of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn but U urealyticum and Staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from the trachea antemortem and from lung tissue obtained during autopsy on the 12th postnatal day. The third infant had persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and a pulmonary infiltrate within hours after birth with tracheal cultures positive for both U urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis. Erythromycin was given for ten days, and the infant gradually improved. Prolonged ventilation with supplemental oxygen was necessary, and chronic lung disease developed. This is the first report of neonatal ureaplasmal pneumonia with sepsis and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn as well as the first time a microorganism other than streptococci has been specifically implicated in the pathogenesis of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Respiratory infections with U urealyticum or other bacteria should be considered as possible causative or contributory factors in infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn."

All but three of the children were aged 1-24 months. Only nine children were malnourished, with weight for age less than 70% of the Harvard median (three had weight for age less than 60% of the Harvard median). Pneumocystis carinii antigen was detected in the serum of 23 children. Twenty two children had serological evidence of recent infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Five children were probably infected with Chlamydia trachomatis at the time of the study, and there was less convincing serological evidence of current infection in a further 11 children. Five children showed a fourfold rise in antibody to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Although only one child showed a fourfold rise in antibody to cytomegalovirus, 86 children had this antibody. No child showed a fourfold rise in antibody to Ureaplasma urealyticum or Legionella pneumophila.

Of these patients, 145 (70%) had evidence of infection with one or more pathogens. The most common etiologic agents were Chlamydia trachomatis 61/193 (36%), respiratory syncytial virus 33/142 (23%), cytomegalovirus 42/203 (20%), Pneumocystis carinii 30/171 (17%), and Ureaplasma urealyticum 21/125 (16%). The initial clinical presentation was characterized by cough, rales, normal temperature, and diffuse obstructive airways disease by chest roentgenogram. Regardless of etiology, significant association occurred for cough and cytomegalovirus, apnea and Pneumocystis, and conjunctivitis and Chlamydia. Longitudinal follow-up demonstrates a mortality of 7/205 (3.4%). Morbidity was manifest as recurrent wheezing episodes in 86/187 (46%) patients, persistently abnormal chest roentgenographic findings for at least 12 months in 17/109 (15%) patients, and abnormal pulmonary functions in 15/25 (60%) patients. These abnormalities occurred irrespective of prematurity, atopy, or the initial etiologic agent associated with the pneumonitis. These data add further evidence that respiratory infections during infancy may well be predecessors of obstructive airways disease in later life."

","SPECIES:UreaplasmaID:32141797TITLE:Ureaplasma species and preterm birth: current perspectives.ABSTRACT:Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the human Ureaplasma species are most frequently isolated from the amniotic fluid and placenta in these cases. Ureaplasma colonisation is associated with infertility, stillbirth, histologic chorioamnionitis, and neonatal morbidities, including congenital pneumonia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, meningitis and perinatal death. The human Ureaplasma spp. are separated into Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum with 14 known serotypes. The small genome has several genes, which code for surface proteins; most significantly the Multiple Banded Antigen (MBA) where an antigenic C-terminal domain elicits a host antibody response. Other genes code for various virulence factors such as IgA protease and urease. Ureaplasma spp. infection is diagnosed by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and commercial assays are available to improve turnaround time. Microbroth dilution assays are routinely used to test antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical Ureaplasma spp. especially against doxycycline, azithromycin, ofloxacin and josamycin. Resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines has been reported. A concise review of Ureaplasma spp. and their role in pregnancy outcomes, especially preterm birth, offers insight into the early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent long-term complications of Ureaplasma spp. infections."

We describe the first case of hyperammonemia syndrome due to Ureaplasma infection after liver-kidney transplantation. Our patient rapidly recovered after specific antibiotic treatment. It is important to consider these infections in the differential diagnosis for encephalopathy post-transplant, as these organisms often do not grow using routine culture methods and polymerase chain reaction testing is typically required for their detection. This is particularly critical after liver transplantation, where a number of other etiologies may be considered as a cause of hyperammonemia syndrome."

Its importance as a respiratory pathogen beyond the field of neonatology remains controversial. We report a case of Ureaplasma-pneumonia in a recently lung-transplanted patient, with hyperammonemic syndrome. The 51-year-old lung-transplanted female was admitted to the intensive care unit with new-onset reduction of her mental state due to hyperammonemia. A diagnostic bronchoscopy showed purulent bronchitis and multiple superficial ulcerations of the bronchial mucosa. The DNA-PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum in low concentration (about 5 * 104 copies/ml), which was interpreted as evidence of infection and treated with Doxycycline intravenously. Ureaplasma was also identified by DNA-PCR in the biopsy specimens of the inflammatory enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Bilateral pleural effusions were found to be transudative and culturally sterile. Ureaplasma-pneumonia can cause fatal hyperammonemia in lung-transplant patients and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of every unclear hyperammonemia with normal liver function. The early identification and treatment of the infection leads to clinical and biochemical resolution."

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 480 neonates born prior to 32 weeks' gestation. They were divided into groups according to maternal cervicovaginal culture results. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict neonatal outcome based on maternal culture results, adjusted for perinatal risk factors and neonatal morbidities. RESULT: Maternal cervicovaginal Ureaplasma colonization was independently associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks (BPD) (OR 8.34; 95% CI 1.21-57.45). In neonates with and without maternal cervicovaginal Ureaplasma colonization BPD occurred in 12.3% and 3.8%, respectively. Maternal colonization with other microorganisms was associated with a higher neonatal mortality (p = 0.002), lower gestational age (p = 0.026), and birth weight (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the role of the maternal cervicovaginal microbiome as a predictor of neonatal outcome.

We sought to characterize the epidemiology of Ureaplasma spp in candidates and donors and describe outcomes of antimicrobial therapy in preventing and treating HS. METHODS: Candidate testing for Ureaplasma spp was performed with urine culture and PCR pre-transplant. Positive candidates were treated with levofloxacin. Donor testing was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage culture and PCR intraoperatively. From 7/2014-2/2017 patients were treated according to results; from 2/2017-10/2018 recipients received empiric levofloxacin and azithromycin at transplant until testing returned negative. HS was defined as new onset altered mental status after transplant with ammonia > 200 micromol/L. RESULTS: 60 patients who underwent lung transplant were included. 80% (n = 48) of patients had negative screening tests in donor and candidate pre-lung transplant, 8.3% (n = 5) of recipients had positive Ureaplasma spp testing in urine pre-transplant, and 13.3% (n = 8) had positive donor BAL testing at the time of lung transplant. 3 patients developed HS a median of 7 days post-transplant; 2 died of HS. Recipients of organs with Ureaplasma spp who received empiric therapy did not develop HS. Donors with Ureaplasma spp were younger and more sexually active. CONCLUSION: Donor-derived Ureaplasma spp in lung transplant was associated with HS. Screening lung donors for Ureaplasma spp might allow for targeted therapy to reduce risk for development of HS, but future confirmatory studies are needed."

She underwent urological and gastroenterological examinations which yielded normal findings. After the onset of genital discomfort and copious amounts of vaginal discharge, gynaecological examination and routine microbiological testing of discharge were negative. Finally, she presented with septicaemia and progressive abdominal pain. Laparoscopy was performed due to absence of recovery after initial transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of ovarian cysts.

This prospective study was conducted to specify their role in these diseases. POPULATION AND METHODS--A pharyngeal or tracheal swab specimen for mycoplasmas culture was obtained from 100 infants admitted consecutively to the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU) during the first 24 hours of life. Mycoplasma culture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid was also performed. Pharyngeal and/or tracheal specimens were collected again on days 5, 15 and 28 if the child was still in the NCU. Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) were identified by culture in a modified Hayflick's medium. RESULTS--Three-hundred and ten pharyngeal or tracheal swabs were obtained (100 on day 0, 89 on day 5, 72 on day 15 and 49 on day 28). Twenty-one infants had one or more positive swabs in the first five days of life (20 on day 0 and one on day 5); those forming the ""Myco+"" group and the others forming the ""Myco-"" group. Uu was isolated alone from 20 infants, associated with Mh from one. Both groups were similar for gestational age, birth weight, maternal fever during labor, prolonged rupture of the fetal membranes or chorioamnionitis and for the incidence of acute respiratory distress. There was a statistically significant difference for the route of delivery (chi 2 &lt; 0.02). One blood culture (from 92 performed) was positive for Uu and another positive for Uu and Mh. Both children were cured without any specific mycoplasmacidal therapy. Three children had probable Uu infection and were also cured without specific therapy. CONCLUSIONS--A pharyngeal colonization with genital mycoplasmas is common in the first days of life (21%) but our data do not allow us to conclude that they are accountable for newborn infections."

Her mother suffered from genital mycoplasmosis and had blood antibodies to Myc. Hominis and Ureapl. urealyticum. Most pronounced changes are found in the liver: hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis with PAS- and azur-positive granules in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and macrophages, lymphohistiocytic infiltration of portal tracts and parenchyma, biliary duct proliferation, cholestases. The lungs: interstitial pneumonia with minimal alteration of the bronchial epithelium. The above spectrum of alterations suggests transplacental contamination. Ganglioneuroblastoma consisting of embryonal neuroblasts found in the adrenals is considered as an independent disease. The first child of this woman died 14-days old and had morphological signs of the intrauterine infection and pronounced liver dysplasia; possible oncogenicity of mycoplasma is discussed."

The association of U. urealyticum with acute and chronic respiratory disease in term and preterm newborns has recently been reported. Our two cases are similar to other case reports from the literature, but we were unable to find any previous reports of osteomyelitis due to U. urealyticum in the premature babies. Isolation of U. urealyticum in pure culture from the blood was considered to be related to local infection in all three patients. All patients were cured by erythromycin."

We hypothesized that among infants with birth weights &lt; or = 1,250 g and respiratory disease, those with U. urealyticum in their tracheal aspirates would have radiographic evidence of more-severe pulmonary disease more often than would those without this organism. A total of 292 low-birth-weight infants who had endotracheal aspirate cultured within 7 days of birth were enrolled. The radiographic outcome variables were pneumonia, early severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (precocious), and chronic lung disease. Microorganisms were isolated from 128 infants (44%); U. urealyticum was isolated from 44 (15%). Pneumonia was significantly more common in infants with than without U. urealyticum (30% vs. 16%, P = .03). U. urealyticum also was associated with precocious bronchopulmonary dysplasia independent of prematurity, race, and sex (odds ratio, 2.2; P &lt; .05). Tracheal isolation of U. urealyticum within 7 days of birth is associated with pneumonia and precocious bronchopulmonary dysplasia."

","SPECIES:UreaplasmaID:8399903TITLE:Systemic neonatal infection due to Ureaplasma urealyticum.ABSTRACT:During the past decade considerable evidence, first based on individual case reports and later on prospective studies, has indicated that Ureaplasma urealyticum may be an important neonatal pathogen. Infections of the bloodstream, respiratory tract, and central nervous system have been documented. Isolation of U. urealyticum from the lower genital tract in a large percentage of healthy women and the likelihood that many may transmit infection to their offspring, either in utero or at delivery, have made it difficult to determine the pathogenic potential of this organism in perinatal infections. Early studies showed that newborn infants colonized superficially by U. urealyticum suffered no adverse effects. However, more recent studies involving primarily preterm neonates have clearly demonstrated the ability of U. urealyticum to produce invasive disease. Future investigation should be directed towards a more in-depth characterization of the basic biology of U. urealyticum, identification of the risk factors predictive of invasive disease among those colonized, and the development of rapid tests to detect its presence and to determine the overall significance and prevalence of this organism in specific neonatal infections."

","SPECIES:UreaplasmaID:8399924TITLE:Unique susceptibility of patients with antibody deficiency to mycoplasma infection.ABSTRACT:Patients with congenital or acquired disorders of antibody production suffer from a wide variety of infections. They are most often bacterial and due to Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Chronic pulmonary disease accounts for most of the deaths. While non-urogenital tract infections due to Ureaplasma urealyticum or other mycoplasmas are unusual in individuals with normal resistance, patients with antibody deficiency demonstrate a unique susceptibility. With increasing frequency, patients with impaired humoral immunity have been shown to have a mycoplasmal infection that results in pneumonitis, sinusitis, cystitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, or cellulitis. The mycoplasmas may be responsible for chronic sinopulmonary disease in a majority of such patients. Awareness of the role these organisms play in causing infection in antibody-deficient patients and the institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy will contribute to an improvement in clinical outcome."

","SPECIES:UreaplasmaID:8457981TITLE:Ureaplasma urealyticum intrauterine infection: role in prematurity and disease in newborns.ABSTRACT:Ureaplasma urealyticum, a common commensal of the urogenital tract of sexually mature humans, is gaining recognition as an important opportunistic pathogen during pregnancy. While its etiologic significance in many aspects of adverse pregnancy remains controversial, recent evidence indicates that U. urealyticum in the absence of other organisms is a cause of chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, ureaplasmal infection of the chorioamnion is significantly associated with premature spontaneous labor and delivery. In at least some cases, it appears to be causal. Present evidence indicates that U. urealyticum is a cause of septicemia, meningitis, and pneumonia in newborn infants, particularly those born prematurely. There is strong but not definitive evidence that ureaplasmal infection of the lower respiratory tract can lead to development of chronic lung disease in very low-birth-weight infants. Although risk factors for colonization of the lower genitourinary tract have been identified, little information is available concerning risk factors for intrauterine infection and host immune responses to invasive infection. Recent establishment of animal models of respiratory and central nervous system diseases should provide an opportunity to evaluate risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms, and operative immune mechanisms. However, the most critical need is additional information concerning indications for diagnosis and treatment as well as efficacy of treatment."

","SPECIES:UreaplasmaID:8474408TITLE:Ureaplasma urealyticum and its role in neonatal lung disease.ABSTRACT:Ureaplasma urealyticum, a species of mycoplasma organisms, is a sexually transmitted organism which can cause a pneumonia in premature neonates. Ureaplasma urealyticum infection in the neonate occurs secondary to maternal transmission of the organism to the neonate. Recent studies show very low birth weight neonates with Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia are approximately two times more likely to develop chronic lung disease. Clinically Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia presents in a premature neonate and is often coexistent with hyaline membrane disease, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and continued respiratory distress without identification of a causative organism. Diagnosis is generally by tracheal aspirate or spinal fluid culture. Ureaplasma urealyticum requires specific culture media to grow, and recovery of the organism can take several weeks. Clinical management of the infant includes administration of erythromycin and meticulous pulmonary toilet. A case study which represents the typical presentation of Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia is included."

No C. trachomatis was found and this probably reflects the low prevalence of genital carriage in antenatal patients in our population. Nine percent of babes were colonized at birth with Ureaplasma urealyticum and 5% acquired colonization. One child whose mother was bacteremic for ureaplasma, had evidence of persistent respiratory colonization and development of pneumonia at day 16 of life, supporting a role for this organism as a respiratory pathogen. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) occurred in 39% of the infants. Ureaplasma carriage correlated significantly with BPD development, as 29% of infants with BPD were ureaplasma positive compared to 4% of those without development of BPD (p = 0.02)."

METHODS: From October, 1993, to January, 1996, all infants who met the following entry criteria were enrolled in the study: birth weights &lt; or = 1500 g; admission to the NICU within 24 h after birth; evidence on admission of respiratory distress; and no prior antibiotic treatment. Infants were cultured for mycoplasmas, viruses, chlamydiae and aerobic and anaeroic bacteria. RESULTS: Ninety-four critically ill newborns constituted our study cohort. Within 7 days of birth more infants with U. urealyticum infection showed radiographic features of pneumonia (53.1%, 25 of 47) than infants without U. urealyticum infection (21.2%, 10 of 47). Infants with U. urealyticum were more likely to have radiographic evidence of precocious bronchopulmonary dysplasia than those without this isolate (22.5%, 9 of 40 vs. 2.3%, 1 of 42). The relative risk of oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of corrected age in U. urealyticum-positive infants was 11.0 times that in U. urealyticum-negative infants (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 75.5). Association of U. urealyticum and chronic lung disease at this age was not weakened after adjustments were made in a multivariate analysis for other significant risk factors including gestational age and presence of a patent ductus arteriosus. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation of U. urealyticum from respiratory tracts is associated with radiographic changes compatible with pneumonia within 7 days of birth, precocious bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmonary outcome."

They can also cause pneumonia and meningitis in newborn infants. In this paper we used nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction to analyze 22 samples from patients with different urogenital symptoms in order to detect mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas. We obtained 10 positive samples and 12 were negative. From positive samples we identified two with Mycoplasma hominis, two with Ureaplasma and six with both species. The results obtained by these molecular techniques were compared with reference methods and we found coincident results in 18 samples, while in four the results were discordant. These discordant findings were not statistically significant."
