TITLE:Vibrio vulnificus infection in Taiwan: report of 28 cases and review of clinical manifestations and treatment.
ABSTRACT:From May 1985 through July 1990, 28 episodes of Vibrio vulnificus infection in 27 patients were encountered in five major hospitals in Taiwan. The ages of patients ranged from 19 to 76 years; the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. Eighteen episodes manifested as bacteremia and eight as wound infections alone. One patient each developed gastroenteritis and pneumonia after nearly drowning. Twenty-three patients exhibited skin manifestations. Twenty patients had underlying diseases. All patients were treated with antibiotics, and 14 also underwent some form of surgical treatment (incision and drainage, fasciotomy, debridement, or amputation). Thirteen of the 28 episodes were preceded by precipitating factors; most were due to ingestion of seafood or exposure of abraded skin to salt water. Ten of the 18 septicemic patients died--most within 48 hours of hospitalization. One patient without bacteremia who had a wound infection died. Results of in vitro susceptibility studies suggested that ampicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin would be effective. Susceptibility to aminoglycosides was observed for greater than 90% of isolates. We recommend combined therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside along with appropriate surgical therapy for the treatment of V. vulnificus infection.

题目:台湾创伤弧菌感染28例报告及临床表现及治疗回顾。
摘要:1985年5月至1990年7月，台湾省五所主要医院共发生创伤弧菌感染27例，共28例。患者年龄19 ~ 76岁;男女之比为2:1。18例为菌血症，8例仅为伤口感染。各有一名病人在接近溺水后出现肠胃炎和肺炎。23例患者出现皮肤表现。有基础疾病者20例。所有患者均接受抗生素治疗，14例也接受了某种形式的手术治疗(切口引流、筋膜切开术、清创或截肢)。在28起事件中，有13起事件之前有诱发因素;其中大部分是由于食用海鲜或皮肤被海水擦伤造成的。18名败血症患者中有10人死亡——大多数在住院48小时内死亡。一名没有菌血症但有伤口感染的病人死亡。体外药敏试验结果表明，氨苄西林或第三代头孢菌素是有效的。观察到超过90%的分离株对氨基糖苷类药物敏感。对于创伤弧菌感染，我们建议联合使用第三代头孢菌素或氨苄西林和氨基糖苷类药物，同时辅以适当的手术治疗。"

ABSTRACT:An 80-year-old man with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia developed pneumonia and empyema due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus (formerly CDC group DF-2). No growth was detected in blood cultures, but the organism was identified from cultures of pleural fluid. The infection responded well to antibiotics and drainage via a chest tube. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical isolate of C. canimorsus from a pulmonary source. The absence of concurrent bacteremia raises the possibility that the lower respiratory tract can be the site of primary infection with this organism.

TITLE:Bacteremia in a long-term-care facility: a five-year prospective study of 163 consecutive episodes.
ABSTRACT:The clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes of 163 episodes of bacteremia occurring at a long-term-care facility were evaluated. The rate of nosocomial bacteremia increased from 0.20 to 0.36 cases/1,000 patient-days from 1985 to 1989; there was a parallel increase in the rate of all nosocomial infections combined. Bacteremia was documented in 6.5% of all hospital-acquired infections. The majority of isolates were gram-negative, and Providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative species. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent isolate; one-third of S. aureus strains were resistant to methicillin. Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 36 episodes (22%), 14 of which involved an enterococcal species. Portals of entry included the urinary tract (55%), the respiratory tract (11%), and soft tissue (9%). Overall mortality was 21.5%. Death was significantly associated with residence on the intermediate-care unit, the presence of a respiratory infection, a change in mental status, and relatively recent admission. Optimal management of bacterial infection in a long-term-care setting requires the availability of blood culture results. Initial decisions about antibiotic therapy should be made in light of the likelihood of infection with multiresistant organisms and of polymicrobial infection.

标题:长期护理机构中的菌血症:一项连续163例病例的5年前瞻性研究。
摘要:对163例发生在长期护理机构的菌血症患者的临床特征、微生物学特征和预后进行了评估。从1985年到1989年，医院内菌血症发生率从0.20例/千例天增加到0.36例/千例天;同时，所有医院感染的发生率也在增加。6.5%的医院获得性感染有菌血症的记录。大多数分离株为革兰氏阴性，其中最常见的革兰氏阴性菌为stuartii。金黄色葡萄球菌是最常见的分离株;三分之一的金黄色葡萄球菌菌株对甲氧西林耐药。菌血症是多微生物的36例(22%)，其中14例涉及一种肠球菌。进入通道包括尿路(55%)、呼吸道(11%)和软组织(9%)。总死亡率为21.5%。死亡与在中级护理病房的居住、呼吸道感染的存在、精神状态的变化和相对最近的入院有显著相关。在长期护理环境下细菌感染的最佳管理需要血液培养结果的可用性。关于抗生素治疗的最初决定应根据感染多耐药微生物和多菌感染的可能性作出。"

TITLE:Pseudomonas infections in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.
ABSTRACT:We identified and reviewed retrospectively all the cases of infection by Pseudomonas and related genera in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) who were hospitalized at our Institution over a 36-month period. We recorded 48 episodes of infection in 34 of 355 patients with AIDS, and in two of 73 patients with ARC: 25 pneumonias (9 community-acquired and 16 of nosocomial origin). 20 urinary tract infections, two soft tissue infections and one sepsis. In 14 of 16 patients with nosocomial pneumonia but in only one of nine patients with community-acquired pneumonia did we find coexisting opportunistic lung diseases. The following micro-organisms were isolated: P. aeruginosa in 41 cases, P. fluorescens in three cases, Xanthomonas maltophilia (P. maltophilia) in two cases, P. putida in one case. Comamonas testosteronis (P. testosteronis) and Comamonas acidovorans (P. acidovorans) in one case. Amikacin and ceftazidime, alone or in combination, appear to be the optimal choice of therapy for severe Pseudomonas infections in HIV-infected patients, although in our study six of 47 isolates were resistant in vitro to amikacin, and nine of 31 isolates were resistant to ceftazidime.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To present the first case in Australia in which Legionella maceachernii has been documented as a cause of infection. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 71-year-old retired carpenter with underlying autoimmune disease and pulmonary fibrosis was admitted to hospital with increasing shortness of breath and fever, and pneumonia was diagnosed. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: He was treated with ampicillin then gentamicin and flucloxacillin and later imipenem but his condition deteriorated with progression of the pneumonia and abscess formation and he died 25 days after admission. Subsequently, L. maceachernii was isolated from three sputum samples collected before the patient died. 
CONCLUSION: There is a need for clinical awareness of the value of sputum culture in the diagnosis of infection due to Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila.

ABSTRACT:A 46-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on Mar. 16, 1988 with the chief complaint of productive cough. The chest roentgenogram and tomogram showed a tumorous shadow in the right upper lobe, accompanied with stenosis of the trachea and the right main bronchus. Bronchofiberscopic examination confirmed a nodular tumor protruding into the lower part of the trachea from the right lateral wall and nearly complete obstruction of the right main bronchus. Pathological specimen obtained by transbronchial biopsy revealed ""low differentiated adenocarcinoma"". It was highly suspected that the primary lung cancer had directly invaded the trachea and the right main bronchus. His symptoms and roentgenological findings remarkably improved after radiation therapy. He was discharged on May 12. On Sep. 14, he was admitted to our hospital again because of hoarseness, general fatigue and increasing dyspnea. The chest CT demonstrated severe stenosis of the trachea, which was treated with another radiation therapy. Although his symptoms diminished, he had a sudden onset of high fever on Oct. 15. Immediately a blood culture and transtracheal aspiration (TTA) were performed. Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the blood culture four days later. The administration of fosfomycin and tobramycin was started. However he died because of massive hemoptysis on Oct. 23. Several days after the death, an isolated strain was identified as Capnocytophaga ochracea by the biochemical characteristics. Culture of sputum obtained by TTA was negative for Capnocytophaga ochracea. Septicemia due to Capnocytophaga spp. is very rare and only one case (due to Capnocytophaga sputigena) has been reported until now in Japan.

TITLE:Infection caused by Francisella philomiragia (formerly Yersinia philomiragia). A newly recognized human pathogen.
ABSTRACT:We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with Francisella philomiragia (formerly Yersinia philomiragia) isolated from normally sterile sites. Isolates from 14 patients were received by the Centers for Disease Control between 1975 and 1987: 9 were from blood; 2 from lung biopsies; and 1 each from pleural, peritoneal, and cerebrospinal fluid. Underlying problems included chronic granulomatous disease in 5 patients, near-drowning in 5, and a myeloproliferative disease in 2. All 13 patients for whom records were available had a febrile syndrome compatible with bacterial infection. Pneumonia and fever-bacteremia were the commonest clinical syndromes reported. In 7 cases, F. philomiragia was the only sterile-site isolate, and the clinical syndrome did not resolve without appropriate antibiotics. Familiarity with this organism is important because of its ability to cause serious disease in chronic granulomatous disease and near-drowning patients. Further study may yield new insights into pathogenic and host defense mechanisms.

TITLE:Legionella species as hospital-acquired respiratory pathogens.
ABSTRACT:Nosocomial pneumonia caused by legionella is an increasingly recognized entity. Legionella sp responsible for documented nosocomial disease include Legionella pneumophila, Tatlockia micdadei, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffi and Legionella oakridgensis. The clinical presentation is nonspecific although diarrhea occurs frequently. Hyponatremia occurs significantly more frequently in legionnaires' disease than pneumonias caused by other agents. Chest roentgenographic findings are nonspecific, although cavitation can be seen in immunosuppressed patients. Laboratory methods require the use of direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains, culture using selective media, serologic testing, and detection of antigen in urine. The DFA test is not sensitive; however, it does correlate with the severity of disease. Culture from sputa is now feasible. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a promising technique for obtaining specimens. The ideal specimen for culture is that obtained by transtracheal aspiration, which bypasses oropharyngeal contamination. Combination therapy of erythromycin and rifampin is recommended for selected patients. Because the source of the organism is the hospital water distribution system, we recommend routine environmental surveillance, especially in hospitals in which organ transplants are performed. The role of cooling towers as a vector for dissemination of the organism is disputed. Disinfection of the water supply can be accomplished by using heat eradication. Chlorination has generally proven unsatisfactory because of organism persistence as well as corrosive damage to the plumbing system from the chlorine. Both physician awareness and availability of specialized laboratory testing are necessary for the detection of cases.

摘要:军团菌引起的医院性肺炎是一个越来越被认识的实体。造成医院疾病的军团菌包括嗜肺军团菌、米达代塔洛克氏菌、波泽曼军团菌、杜莫菲军团菌和奥克里氏军团菌。虽然腹泻也经常发生，但其临床表现是非特异性的。在军团病中，低钠血症明显比其他病原体引起的肺炎更常见。尽管在免疫抑制患者中可见空化现象，但胸部x线片的表现是非特异性的。实验室方法需要使用直接荧光抗体(DFA)染色，使用选择性培养基培养，血清学测试，以及检测尿液中的抗原。DFA检测不敏感;然而，它确实与疾病的严重程度有关。痰培养现在是可行的。支气管肺泡灌洗是一种很有前途的标本获取技术。理想的培养标本是经过口咽污染的经气管抽吸获得的标本。对选定的患者推荐红霉素和利福平联合治疗。因为生物体的来源是医院的水分配系统，我们建议进行常规的环境监测，特别是在进行器官移植的医院。冷却塔作为生物传播媒介的作用是有争议的。水源的消毒可以通过灭热来完成。由于有机物的持久性以及氯对管道系统的腐蚀性损害，氯化反应通常不令人满意。医生的认识和专业实验室检测对于发现病例都是必要的。"

ABSTRACT:During a 14-month study period, 92 patients admitted to the University Clinic for Infectious Diseases with pneumonia were investigated to determine the prevalence and severity of Legionnaires' disease (LD). The diagnosis of LD was based on positive serology. Antibodies to 10 different legionella antigens--Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-6, Fluoribacter (Legionella) bozemanae, F. dumoffii, F. gormanii, and Tatlockia (Legionella) micdadei--were measured by the microagglutination (MA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques. LD was diagnosed in 22 patients showing a 4-fold or greater rise of MA titers. 10 patients showed a 4-fold or greater rise of IFA titer, 2 had standing high titer. One patient died. Legionella infection was the second most common cause of pneumonia. However, in half of the cases legionella infection occurred concomitantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, or viral infections. All 22 LD cases were sporadic. LD had been contracted abroad by 6 patients. Two of the legionella pneumonias were hospital-acquired. Half of the LD patients were older than 60 years. The majority of cases occurred during the winter months. Neither clinical chemistry parameters nor clinical features could distinguish LD from other types of pneumonia.

标题:军团病在丹麦传染病部收治的肺炎患者中的患病率。
摘要:在为期14个月的研究期间，对92例因肺炎感染性疾病而入住大学诊所的患者进行调查，以确定军团病(LD)的患病率和严重程度。LD的诊断以血清学阳性为基础。用微凝集(MA)和间接荧光抗体(IFA)技术检测了10种军团菌抗原——嗜肺军团菌血清群1-6、波兹曼荧光杆菌(bozemanae)、杜氏军团菌(F. dumoffii)、戈曼军团菌(F. gormanii)和米氏军团菌(Tatlockia)的抗体。22名患者被诊断为LD，其血滴度上升了4倍或更多。10例患者的IFA滴度上升4倍或更多，2例持续高滴度。一个病人死了。军团菌感染是肺炎的第二大常见原因。然而，在一半的军团菌感染病例中同时发生肺炎链球菌、流感嗜血杆菌、肺炎支原体、鹦鹉衣原体或病毒感染。22例LD均为散发型。有6例患者在国外感染LD。其中两例肺炎军团菌是在医院感染的。半数LD患者年龄大于60岁。大多数病例发生在冬季。临床化学指标和临床特征均不能区分LD与其他类型肺炎。"

ABSTRACT:Kingella species are rarely reported as a cause of endocarditis. We report two cases of K. denitrificans endocarditis occurring in patients with prosthetic valves. K. denitrificans has not been previously reported to cause prosthetic valve endocarditis. Both patients may have developed bacteremia from altered upper respiratory or oral mucosa with subsequent prosthetic valve infection. Treatment with penicillin G and streptomycin was successful in the first patient, whereas ampicillin alone resulted in clinical cure in the second case. Neither patient required further surgery. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that both organisms were highly sensitive to cefotaxime and ampicillin.

TITLE:Treatment of gram-negative infections with aztreonam.
ABSTRACT:Twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. Twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. No bacteria became resistant. Cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). The bacteria responsible for these infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Serratia marcescens (two), Enterobacter gergoviae (three), Enterobacter aerogenes (two), Escherichia coli (one), Citrobacter diversus (one), and Hemophilus influenzae (one). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. Two patients in whom a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. Diarrhea developed in a single patient with Pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. Aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. The only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients.

ABSTRACT:A new species of Legionella that caused pneumonia in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been characterized. The Legionella wadsworthii species nova is proposed for this bacterium. The type strain is Wadsworth 81-716A (American Type Culture Collection 33877). The new species differs phenotypically from L. pneumophila in that the predominant cellular fatty acid is methyl-12-methyltetradecanoic acid (a-15:0) rather than methyl-14-methylpentadecanoic acid (i-16:0), and in its failure to react with L. pneumophila antiserum. The clinical illness caused by L. wadsworthii was not apparently different from that seen with other legionella infections, except for prolonged fever and slow resolution of pulmonary infiltrates.

TITLE:Pulmonary infection due to Legionella cincinnatiensis in renal transplant recipients: two cases and implications for laboratory diagnosis.
ABSTRACT:We report two cases of pneumonia caused by Legionella cincinnatiensis, a species previously identified as a pathogen in only one other instance. Both infections occurred in renal transplant recipients who were receiving only moderate doses of immunosuppressive drugs several years after transplantation; both patients had no recent episodes of rejection. Their clinical courses varied from mild symptoms to multisystem organ failure and death. Species identification by direct fluorescent antibody testing was misleading; initial results revealed infection due to Legionella longbeachae for one patient and infection due to Legionella dumoffii for the other patient. Slide agglutination testing eventually identified both isolates as L. cincinnatiensis. Infection with Legionella species, including L. cincinnatiensis, should be considered not only in the first months after transplantation but also later in the posttransplantation period as either a nosocomial or community-acquired infection.

TITLE:Balneatrix alpica gen. nov., sp. nov., a bacterium associated with pneumonia and meningitis in a spa therapy center.
ABSTRACT:In 1987, an outbreak of pneumonia and meningitis caused by an unknown bacterium occurred in a spa therapy centre. Nine isolates of this pathogen constituted a tight DNA hybridization group. rRNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the studied bacteria represented a new branch in superfamily II (= gamma subclass) of the Proteobacteria, close to the genus Oceanospirillum. The new bacterium was highly polymorphic and, in young cultures, had curved Gram-negative cells, motile by polar single flagella. The new bacterium differed from the genus Oceanospirillum by its lacking the NaCl requirement and by reducing nitrate into nitrite, producing indole from tryptophan and producing acid from carbohydrates. The name Balneatrix alpica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for the studied organism. The type strain is strain 4-87 (= CIP 103589).

ABSTRACT:Hafnia alvei is a gram-negative bacterium that is rarely isolated from human specimens and is rarely considered to be pathogenic. It has been associated with gastroenteritis, meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, nosocomial wound infections, endophthalmitis, and a buttock abscess. We studied 80 H. alvei isolates recovered from 61 patients within a period of 30 months. H. alvei was cultured from sites that included the respiratory tract (n = 38), the gastrointestinal tract (n = 16), and the urogenital tract (n = 12); the organism was found in blood cultures (n = 8), on central venous catheters (n = 3), and on the skin (n = 3). Only 25% of H. alvei isolates were recovered in pure cultures. Fifty-seven (93.4%) of the patients had an underlying illness. H. alvei proved to be the etiologic agent in two episodes of septicemia and in one episode of peritonitis and was probably responsible for septicemia in two other patients and pneumonia in one. All six of these patients recovered after receiving antibiotic treatment and/or standard surgical treatment, when needed. Three of these infections were nosocomial, and three were community acquired. Of the strains of H. alvei tested in our study, 100% were susceptible to netilmicin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem; 92% were susceptible to piperacillin; 90% were susceptible to co-trimoxazole; and 88% were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. In this study, we found H. alvei to be a rare significant etiologic agent of nosocomial and community-acquired infections.

ABSTRACT:Aeromonas is increasingly recognized as a human pathogen that causes a variety of different infections. Aeromonas has rarely been reported as a cause of respiratory infection, and it has been described in near-drowning-associated pneumonia. This article reviews a case of Aeromonas sobria pneumonia associated with a near drowning and considers the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 10 previously reported cases. Nearly all of the cases involved young healthy men, a rapid development of pneumonia and sepsis after a brief stable period postimmersion, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography. A very high rate of positive blood cultures and mortality was also noted. The epidemiological and clinical data in this review may be helpful to the clinician caring for near-drowning victims. Although prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for near-drowning victims, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be rapidly instituted with any evidence of infection.

ABSTRACT:Flavimonas oryzihabitans is rarely reported as a pathogen in humans. Twelve cases of F. oryzihabitans bacteremia were diagnosed at National Taiwan University Hospital over a 3-year period. The clinical features of these patients were analyzed, and antimicrobial susceptibilities and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns of the 12 isolates were studied. Among these 12 patients, eight (67%) had underlying neoplastic diseases and all acquired F. oryzihabitans bacteremia while hospitalized. The clinical syndromes included primary bacteremia in 5 patients (42%), biliary tract infection in 3 (25%), and peritonitis, subdural empyema, infusion-related bacteremia, and pneumonia in 1 each. Polymicrobial bacteremia or concomitant fungemia was seen in three patients (25%). All the patients survived after antibiotic treatment. All isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones but resistant to cephalothin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim. Susceptibility to aztreonam was variable (25%). The RAPD patterns differed among the isolates, indicating the epidemiological unrelatedness of these infections. F. oryzihabitans should be included as an etiology of severe nosocomial infection in patients with underlying debilitating diseases.

ABSTRACT:Leclercia adecarboxylata has been rarely isolated from environmental and clinical specimens. On review of the world literature, we found two reports of L. adecarboxylata infection: one report described a patient with hepatic cirrhosis, and the other described a child dependent on total parenteral nutrition. L. adecarboxylata was isolated from five infected patients who were evaluated at our institution. Three patients had lower-extremity wound infections in which L. adecarboxylata was part of a mixed microbial growth. One patient had pneumonia due to multiple bacteria, including L. adecarboxylata, which were isolated from sputum. L. adecarboxylata was isolated from the blood of one patient with neutropenia and from the blood of the two patients reported in the literature. All patients except one had fever and leukocytosis. L. adecarboxylata isolates were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested. L. adecarboxylata is most frequently isolated as part of a mixed microbial growth. Its role in these infections is not clear. However, the organism caused bacteremia in three patients.

TITLE:Two nursing home outbreaks of respiratory infection with Legionella sainthelensi.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe outbreaks of infection caused by Legionella sainthelensi occurring in older residents of two nursing homes and to determine risk factors for the development of infection. DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology and a case-control study. SETTING: Two nursing homes (140 beds and 254 beds in nursing homes A and B, respectively) located in southern Ontario, Canada, experiencing outbreaks of respiratory tract infection in July and August 1994. SUBJECTS: Case-residents of the two nursing homes who met clinical and laboratory criteria for Legionella infection. Control-residents were defined as those who were in the homes during the outbreaks and were asymptomatic. MEASUREMENTS: Active surveillance was conducted in both nursing homes to identify symptomatic residents. Residents with fever or respiratory tract symptoms had nasopharyngeal swabs taken for viral antigen detection and culture, urine for Legionella antigen detection, and acute and convalescent serology for viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella. Chest X-rays were performed, and an attempt was made to obtain blood and sputum cultures. Water samples from shower heads, faucets, and air conditioning units were collected for Legionella culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A case-control study was done to assess possible risk factors for legionellosis. 
RESULTS: Twenty-nine cases -- 17 in nursing home A; 12 in nursing home B - were identified. Four (14%) case-residents had documented pneumonia and four case-residents died. Univariate analysis revealed that a history of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0-5.3)), eating pureed food (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6-12.7)), and having fluids administered with medication (OR 2.5 (95% CI, 1.0-5.9)) were significant risk factors. Cases were less likely to wear dentures (OR .4 (95% CI, .2-.9)) or to eat solid food (OR .3, (95% CI, .1-.6)). Only eating pureed food remained significant in a multivariable analysis (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6-13.0, P = .01)). 
CONCLUSION: This report describes outbreaks of legionellosis in two nursing homes, representing the first reported outbreaks of infection caused by Legionella sainthelensi. The association with illness of dietary characteristics indicative of swallowing disorders suggests that aspiration was the most likely mode of infection. The diagnosis of legionellosis should be considered during outbreaks of respiratory infection in nursing homes.

标题:两起在养老院爆发的圣特伦斯军团菌呼吸道感染。
文摘:
目的:描述发生在两家养老院老年居民中由圣特伦斯军团菌引起的感染暴发，并确定发生感染的危险因素。设计:描述性流行病学和病例对照研究。环境:位于加拿大安大略省南部的两家养老院(分别为A和B养老院的140张病床和254张病床)，在1994年7月和8月爆发了呼吸道感染。研究对象:两所养老院符合军团菌感染临床和实验室标准的病例居民。对照居民的定义是那些在疫情爆发期间在家中且无症状的人。测量方法:在两个养老院进行积极监测，以识别有症状的居民。有发热或呼吸道症状的居民采集鼻咽拭子进行病毒抗原检测和培养，尿液进行军团菌抗原检测，急性和恢复期血清学检查病毒、肺炎支原体、肺炎衣原体和军团菌。进行胸部x光检查，并尝试进行血液和痰培养。收集喷头、水龙头和空调装置的水样进行军团菌培养和聚合酶链反应检测。通过病例对照研究来评估军团菌病的可能危险因素。
结果:29例，其中A养老院17例;B -养老院12例。4名(14%)住院病例有肺炎记录，4名住院病例死亡。单因素分析显示，卒中史(OR) 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0-5.3)、吃泥状食物(OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6-12.7))和有液体药物给药(OR 2.5 (95% CI, 1.0-5.9))是显著的危险因素。患者戴假牙的可能性较低(OR .4)(95%可信区间，。2。9))或吃固体食物(或。3,(95% CI。1。6))。在多变量分析中，仅食用糊状食物仍有显著意义(OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6-13.0, P = 0.01))。
结论:本报告描述了军团菌病在两家养老院的暴发，这是首次报道的由圣特伦斯军团菌引起的感染暴发。与表明吞咽障碍的饮食特征疾病的相关性表明，吸入性感染是最有可能的感染方式。在疗养院暴发呼吸道感染时应考虑军团病的诊断。"

TITLE:Second-trimester abortion caused by Capnocytophaga sputigena: case report.
ABSTRACT:Intra-amniotic infection is often the cause of a second-trimester abortion. The bacterial species involved include bacteria with low pathogenicity like Ureaplasma urealyticum and various Mycoplasma species. In this case we describe an intra-amniotic infection caused by Capnocytophaga sputigena, often found in the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity, but not in the vagina. Oral sex during pregnancy was the most probable source of the infection. The aborted fetus showed signs of pneumonia upon histologic examination. The bacterial species was identified using broad-spectrum 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly from the amniotic fluid and after bacterial culture. Amniotic fluid glucose was below detection level, confirming the presence of an intra-amniotic infection.

TITLE:Relapsing life threatening community acquired pneumonia due to rare Legionella species responsive to ceftriaxone and aztreonam.
ABSTRACT:A 24 year old Saudi housewife was admitted thrice with life threatening community acquired pneumonia. Even though she responded to an initial cocktail of cefriaxone, erythromcin, rifampicin and flucloxacillin during the second admission, she relapsed within four days of discharge when she was on erythromycin only. During the third admission she was put on ceftriaxone and aztreonam and recovered fully without any relapse. Serology results received later showed Legionella IgM titres of more than 1:256 for Legionella micdadei and Legionella bozemanii, and IgG titres of Legionella hackeliae. This case demonstrates relapsing pneumonia due to Legionella micdadei and bozemanii infection, and previous exposure to Legionella hackeliae. Both species, that is, Legionella micdadei and bozemanii, are resistant to erythromycin, but responded very well to a combination of ceftriaxone and aztreonam have not been used previously for the treatment of Legionnaires diseases.

TITLE:Flavobacterium spp. organisms as opportunistic bacterial pathogens during advanced HIV disease.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of Flavobacterium spp. infection in patients with HIV disease. 
METHODS: Clinical charts of 2412 consecutive HIV-infected patients hospitalized in a 8-year period were retrospectively reviewed, to identify all cases of Flavobacterium spp. infections, and to evaluate their occurrence and outcome according to several epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters. 
RESULTS: Six patients out of 2412 (0.25%), developed Flavobacterium spp. complications: septicaemia in five cases, and pneumonia in the remaining patient, with F. meningosepticum and F. odoratum isolated in two cases and one case, respectively, and unnamed Flavobacterium spp. organisms in the remaining three cases. Flavobacterium spp. organisms were responsible for six out of 1939 overall episodes of non-mycobacterial bacterial diseases observed in our patient group (0.31%). All patients were severely immunocompromised, showing a prior diagnosis of AIDS, a mean CD4+ lymphocyte count of 64.2 (range 12-187) cells/microl, and a mean neutrophil count of 1.143 (range 700-1600) cells (range 700-1600) cells/microl. Antibiotic, corticosteriod, or cotrimoxazole treatment was carried out during the month preceding disease onset by three, two and five patients, respectively. Community-acquired and nosocomial Flavobacterium spp. disease were equally frequent, but the latter occurred with a significantly lower mean neutrophil and CD4+ cell count. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays showed complete sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, and variable resistance to ureidopenicillins, ceftazidime, imipenem, aztreonam, and aminoglycosides. An appropriate antimicrobial regimen obtained clinical and microbiological cure in all cases, in absence of related mortality or relapses. 
CONCLUSIONS: Since only one episode of HIV-associated F. (Sphingobacterium) multivorum complication has been described to date, our series represents the largest one dealing with Flavobacterium spp. infection in the setting of HIV disease. Our experience suggests that Flavobacterium spp. organisms may play a pathogenic role in patients with advanced HIV disease, even when some commonly recognized risk factors are lacking (i.e. indwelling catheters, instrumentation, IV drug abuse), while a very low CD4+ lymphocyte count, leukopaenia-neutropaenia, and concurrent AIDS-related infectious complications may act as important predisposing factors. In view of the infrequent occurrence of these infections, early suspicion is essential for both clinicians and microbiologists facing immunocompromised patients at risk for invasive bacterial complications. Flavobacterium spp. organisms should be taken into consideration as nosocomial- or community-acquired opportunistic pathogens, due to their relationship with advanced immunodeficiency and their elevated resistance to many antimicrobial agents commonly used against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

标题:黄杆菌属微生物作为机会性细菌病原体在晚期艾滋病。
文摘:
目的:探讨黄杆菌属(Flavobacterium spp.)感染在HIV患者中的作用。
方法:回顾性分析2412例连续8年住院的hiv感染者的临床病历，对所有黄杆菌感染病例进行鉴定，并根据流行病学、临床和实验室参数评价其发生和预后。
结果:2412例患者中有6例(0.25%)出现了黄杆菌。并发症:5例出现败血症，1例出现肺炎，2例分离出脑膜炎败血症和飞机菌，1例分离出飞机菌，3例未命名黄杆菌。在我们的患者组中，在1939年观察到的全部非分枝杆菌性细菌疾病中，黄杆菌属占6例(0.31%)。所有的患者都有严重的免疫缺陷，有艾滋病的早期诊断，平均CD4+淋巴细胞计数为64.2(12-187范围)细胞/微升，平均中性粒细胞计数为1.143(700-1600范围)细胞/微升。分别有3名、2名和5名患者在发病前一个月进行了抗生素、皮质激素或复方新诺明治疗。社区获得性黄杆菌病和医院感染黄杆菌病同样常见，但后者发生时中性粒细胞和CD4+细胞计数显著降低。对环丙沙星完全敏感，对脲霉素、头孢他啶、亚胺培南、氨曲南和氨基糖苷类药物有不同的耐药性。在所有病例中，适当的抗菌素治疗方案均获得了临床和微生物治疗，无相关死亡或复发。
结论:由于只有一次与hiv相关的F. (Sphingo迄今为止，已经描述了多vorum并发症，我们的系列代表了在HIV疾病背景下黄杆菌感染最大的一种。我们的经验表明,黄杆菌属种虫害的生物会在晚期艾滋病患者致病作用,即使一些普遍公认的危险因素是缺乏(即留置导管、仪表、静脉药物滥用),在一个非常低的CD4 +淋巴细胞计数,leukopaenia-neutropaenia,并发艾滋病感染并发症可能作为重要的诱发因素。鉴于这些感染很少发生，临床医生和微生物学家在面对免疫功能低下的有侵袭性细菌并发症风险的患者时，早期怀疑是必要的。黄杆菌属微生物应作为医院或社区获得的机会性病原体考虑，因为它们与晚期免疫缺陷症有关，而且它们对许多常用来对抗革兰氏阴性细菌病原体的抗菌药的耐药性提高。"

ABSTRACT:Recurrent soft tissue abscesses of the jaw, wrist, and arm developed in a 73-year-old housewife with nephrotic syndrome and immunoglobulin A(kappa) gammopathy of unknown etiology. Conventional cultures remained negative, despite visible gram-negative rods on microscopy. Broad-spectrum PCR revealed Legionella cincinnatiensis, which was confirmed by isolation of the organism on special Legionella medium. Infections due to Legionella species outside the lungs are rare. L. cincinnatiensis has been implicated in only four cases of clinical infection; these involved the lungs in three patients and the central nervous system in one patient. We conclude that broad-spectrum PCR can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of culture-negative infections with a high probability of bacterial origin and that Legionella might be an underdiagnosed cause of pyogenic soft tissue infection.

In addition, fluoroquinolone resistance is rarely seen in these species, and has never been reported in C. gingivalis. We report a case of pneumonia (confirmed by culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and sepsis due to fluoroquinolone- resistant Capnocytophaga gingivalis in a patient following autologous stem cell transplantation, who responded to treatment with linezolid and metronidazole. Capnocytophaga infections should be considered in patients with fever following stem cell or marrow transplantation, especially those with neutropenia and mucositis.

ABSTRACT:Neisseria weaveri (formerly CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] group M-5 is part of the normal canine oral flora. Infections in humans are usually associated with dog bite wounds. Very rarely the organism has been isolated from sites other than wounds, or from deep seated infections. A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of an acute exacerbation of his bronchiectasis. Gram stain of bronchial washings and expectorated sputum showed numerous polymorphs and Gram-negative bacilli. Routine bacterial culture yielded a heavy pure growth of a Gram-negative rod-shaped organism that was strongly oxidase and catalase positive, indole negative, non-motile and did not ferment carbohydrates. The organism was identified as N. weaveri by using 16S rRNA sequencing. The patient was treated with a 3 weeks course of ofloxacin and had a good response. Sputum culture after treatment yielded normal respiratory flora only. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of lower respiratory tract infection caused by N. weaveri.

ABSTRACT:Moraxella osloensis, a gram-negative bacterium that is saprophytic on skin and mucosa, rarely causes infections. Moreover, infections in patients with cancer have not been reported. We describe 10 cases of M. osloensis blood or catheter infections that occurred during anticancer chemotherapy with or without preexisting neutropenia. The organism was identified definitively by sequencing analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Fever (up to 39.7 degrees C) with substantial neutrophilia characterized these infections. The infections were monomicrobic for 3 patients and polymicrobic for 7 patients. Nine patients acquired the infection through central venous catheter colonization. The likely sources of the organism were sinusitis (3 cases), bronchitis (1 case), presumed subclinical mucositis from anticancer therapy (4 cases), and cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (2 cases). The infections resolved, without catheter removal, after antibiotic therapy with cell wall-active agents, to which all strains were shown to be susceptible. The M. osloensis strains exhibited significant morphologic variations on gram stain, and sheep blood agar was the preferred culture medium for 9 strains.

摘要:osloensis莫拉菌是一种革兰氏阴性菌，在皮肤和粘膜上腐生，很少引起感染。此外，癌症患者的感染还没有报道。我们描述了10例osloensis血液或导管感染发生在与或不存在中性粒细胞减少症的抗癌化疗期间。通过16S核糖体RNA基因测序分析，确定了该生物。发烧(高达39.7摄氏度)伴大量中性粒细胞增多是这些感染的特征。单微生物感染3例，多微生物感染7例。9例患者通过中心静脉导管定殖获得感染。可能的机体来源为鼻窦炎(3例)、支气管炎(1例)、因抗癌治疗而推测为亚临床黏膜炎(4例)和皮肤移植物vs-宿主病(2例)。在用细胞壁活性药物进行抗生素治疗后，感染消失了，不需要移除导管，所有菌株都对这些药物敏感。革兰氏染色显示出明显的形态学变化，绵羊血琼脂是9株菌株的首选培养基。"

TITLE:Legionella in two splenectomized patients. Coincidence or causal relationship?
ABSTRACT:We describe two splenectomized patients admitted with pneumonia. The course in one was complicated by overwhelming multiorgan failure when the only indicative laboratory result was seropositivity for Legionella hackeliae and Legionella longbeachae. He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and roxithromycin, followed by levofloxacin as well as intensive supportive treatment, and survived. The second patient was seroreactive for Legionella micdadei. In some cases of pneumonia in splenectomized patients tentatively considered to be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the causative agent might have, in fact, been Legionella. We suggest that splenectomy be considered a possible predisposing factor for Legionella pneumonia. Since prompt diagnosis of Legionella infection, especially the non- pneumophila species, is extremely difficult, alertness to this diagnostic option and early empirical initiation of appropriate aggressive antibiotic treatment may be of critical importance.

摘要:我们描述两名因肺炎而接受脾切除术的病人。其中一例的病程因严重的多器官衰竭而复杂化，当时唯一的实验室指示性结果是血清学检测血清学阳性的hackeliae军团菌和longbeachae军团菌。他最初接受头孢曲松和罗红霉素治疗，随后接受左氧氟沙星和强化支持治疗，存活下来。第二例患者对米达代军团菌有血清反应。在一些经脾切除的病人中，肺炎暂时被认为是由肺炎链球菌引起的，实际上病原体可能是军团菌。我们认为脾切除术可能是军团菌肺炎的易感性因素之一。由于军团菌感染，特别是非嗜肺菌种的迅速诊断是极其困难的，对这种诊断选择的警觉性和早期经验性的适当积极的抗生素治疗可能是至关重要的。"

TITLE:Microbiological investigations on a nosocomial case of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia associated with water birth and review of neonatal cases.
ABSTRACT:A case of Legionella pneumophila 1 pneumonia, confirmed by positive serology and urinary antigen, occurred in a 7-day old neonate after water birth in hospital. As respiratory samples were not available for culture, further microbiological investigations were performed in neonate and environment, in order to recognize the source of infection. The hospital water supply was contaminated by L. pneumophila 1 strains (300-2000 cfu/L) of two monoclonal subtypes of Pontiac subgroup. L. spiritensis (10-225 cfu/L) was isolated from cold tap water of the patient's home. PCR from tap and humidifiers water of the patient's home was positive for Legionella spp, but not for L. pneumophila. Because L. pneumophila 1, responsible of child infection, was only isolated from the hospital pool water for waterbirthing, we conclude that the infant acquired the nosocomial legionellosis by prolonged delivery in contaminated water, perhaps by aspiration. Infection control measures for waterbirthing are highly recommended. A review of neonatal case of legionellosis is also presented. As this rare infection may have a high fatality rate if unrecognized, pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of the legionellosis in newborns.

ABSTRACT:Though the pathogenic significance and the reservoir of Ewingella americana have not been clarified, this organism has caused several pathogenic infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. We report a pneumonia in a patient with chronic renal failure, who had chronic rejection of transplanted kidney. E. americana was identified to be the pathogen of pneumonia with clinical symptoms and signs and radiological examination. As soon as he was treated with ceftriaxone and isepamicin, clinical improvement was followed with no further growth of E. americana or other pathogenic isolates from sputum culture. This suggests to be the case of pneumonia caused by E. americana for the first time in the Korean literature.

ABSTRACT:In July 2002, a large outbreak of legionellosis occurred in a bathhouse with spa facilities in Miyazaki Prefecture. Two hundred-ninety-five patients (including suspected cases) that had pneumonia and/or symptoms of fever, cough and so forth were reported; 37% of them were hospitalized and seven people died. In environmental investigations, Legionella pneumophila serogroups (SGs) land 8, L. dumoffii, L. londiniensis, some other Legionella species and many kinds of amoeba were isolated from 55 samples of bathtub water, tank water, filters and so forth in the spa facilities. The dominant isolates from the bathtab waters belonged to L. londiniensis, L. dumoffii and L. pneumophila SG1, and their maximum concentrations were 1.5 x 10(6), 5.2 x 10(5) and 1.6 x 10(5) cfu/100 mL, respectively. L. pneumophila SG1 strains isolated from bathtub water, tank water, filters and sputa of patients showed a indistinguishable DNA fingerprint pattern by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), confirming that the source of infection was the spa water. Our study indicate that spas may be a significant health hazard if hygienic management fails.

On the third day after surgery the patient developed radiographic signs consistent with pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Two blood cultures and a respiratory secretion sample grew a microorganism identified as Hafnia alvei. H. alvei is a gram-negative bacillus that colonizes the digestive tract of humans and animals and in immunodepressed patients it can colonize the mouth and pharynx. Isolation of H. alvei is described in the literature on pediatric patients and those with a history of immune deficiency or chronic disease. Infection has a severe impact on general health. We report a rare and interesting case of pneumonia and bacteremia from H. alvei infection acquired by an immunocompetent patient soon after arrival in the postoperative recovery unit.

ABSTRACT:UNLABELLED: A 5-y-old girl was admitted to our hospital with fever, cough, respiratory distress and rapidly increasing oxygen requirements. A chest radiograph showed bilateral central infiltrates. PCR was performed with pharyngeal washings and revealed Legionella DNA, while no genetic materials of other pathogens such as respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia were detected. The clinical condition improved gradually after administration of steroids and therapy with clarithromycin. Further sequencing of Legionella DNA led to the identification of Legionella waltersii. This Legionella species has never been described as a human pathogen before. 
CONCLUSION: For the first time, L. waltersii was identified as a cause of severe pneumonia. Since L. waltersii is not detected by routine laboratory tests, it may be speculated that these bacteria, like other Legionella species, are underestimated as a probable cause of community-acquired pneumonia.

The infectious agents were identified in 15 patients: Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, 8; Legionella pneumophila, 3; L. anisa, 1; Parachlamydia sp., 1; Bosea massiliensis, L. worsleiensis, L. quinlivanii, and L. rubrilucens, 1; and M. amorphae and R. bacterium, 1. A. polyphaga mimivirus was the fourth most common etiologic agent, with a higher seroprevalence than noted in healthy controls. This finding suggested its clinical relevance. Therefore, AAM might cause nosocomial pneumonia and should be suspected when conventional microbiologic results are negative.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe and report a case of multidrug-resistant Ewingella americana associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old female presented to her physician with shortness of breath and an initial assessment of pneumonia. Her past medical history included COPD, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, recent Mycobacterium avium infection, and Crohn's disease. Blood and urine cultures revealed no growth; however, a sputum culture later revealed multidrug-resistant E. americana. The patient was ultimately treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), with complete resolution of symptoms following a 10 day course. DISCUSSION: E. americana is a rare gram-negative bacillus that has infrequently been reported to cause infection. This organism has been reported in humans in the blood, sputum, conjunctiva, wounds, and peritoneal fluid. In several of these cases, as well as in our case, this organism appeared to occur more frequently in immunocompromised patients. Although generally susceptible to most antibiotics, our patient's organism was resistant to all antibiotics tested, with the exception of TMP/SMX, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and cefotetan. 
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is only the second case of an E. americana respiratory infection, and the only one in which multidrug resistance has been reported.

ABSTRACT:Bordetella spp. are not normally included when considering the opportunistic bacterial species that are typically involved in respiratory tract infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). By using a combination of bacterial genotyping and 16S rDNA sequencing, Bordetella spp. were identified in cultures obtained from 43 individuals with CF. Most (n = 23) patients were infected with Bordetella bronchiseptica/parapertussis; five were infected with Bordetella hinzii, four with Bordetella petrii, three with Bordetella avium, and eight with unidentified Bordetella spp. Consideration should be given to the presence of these organisms in the evaluation of CF sputum cultures.

ABSTRACT:We describe in this article a case of septicaemia with Capnocytophaga suptigena in a premature newborn child. The newborn child exhibited fever at birth, a light inflammatory syndrome and a respiratory failure. The germ was initially identified in the blood-culture of the newborn child by conventional techniques, and then confirmed by sequencing of the ARN 16S. After investigation, it was also found in the mother's vaginal sample. Capnocytophaga sputigena carried by the mother is certainly responsible for infection of the newborn child by ascending way. After antibiotherapy, both mother and child did not present aftereffects. This is the 16th case described in the literature; Capnocytophaga sputigena carried in vaginal area is responsible for preterm labor and for septicaemia associated to respiratory failure of the newborn child. It is thus important not to neglect this germ and to estimate its sensibility to antibiotics.

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of severe pneumonitis with Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria. 
METHOD: Case report and review of the related literatures. The clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, radiographic patterns, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of a case of severe pneumonia caused by A. veronii biovar sobria were described. 
RESULTS: The clinical symptoms of this patient included cough and sputum production with high fever, followed by acute respiratory distress symptom associated with septic shock. Progressive infiltration of lungs was evident in chest radiography, changes suggestive of interstitial pneumonia. Oxygenation was improved by mechanical ventilation and anti-shock therapy was administered. A. veronii biovar sobria was grown in three consecutive cultures of airway secretions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Mild interstitial inflammation was revealed by pathology of transbronchial lung biopsy specimens. The clinical symptoms and the chest infiltrates improved significantly after therapy with antibiotics and glucocorticoids. 
CONCLUSIONS: A. veronii biovar sobria, an intestinal bacterial pathogen, can cause severe pneumonia, which is often underestimated and inadequately understood. Appropriate antibiotics, glucocorticoids and nutritional support are effective treatments.

ABSTRACT:Cedecea spp. which are the members of Enterobacteriaceae family, are mostly isolated from sputum and their clinical importance is not yet demonstrated. This report presents a pneumonia case caused by Cedecea lapagei. A 38-years-old male patient admitted to Inonu University Faculty of Medicine Emergency department with prediagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage was operated and transferred to Intensive Care Unit of Reanimation where he underwent artificial ventilation. On the third day of hospitalization his temperature was 39 degrees C, white blood cell count was 27.000/ml and he was still unconscious. He had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chest X-ray revealed opacities in the right lower lobe and mucoid tracheal secretion ensued following tracheal entubation performed after operation. Direct microscopic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid yielded abundant number of leukocytes and gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria isolated from BAL specimen were identified as C. lapagei by Phoenix 100 (Becton Dickinson, USA) automated system and also by API 20E kit (Biomerieux, France). Upon the initiation of intravenous amikacin (1 x 1 g) and meropenem (3 x 1 g), the signs of infection decreased in intensity, however, the patient was lost due to subarachnoid hemorrhage on the 12th day of hospitalization. In this case it was estimated that C. lapagei pneumonia originated from the aspiration of upper airway secretion owing to unconsciousness of the patient. Although there were reports of Cedecea infections in the literature, this was the first documented case of C. lapagei pneumonia when the accessible related literature was concerned.

TITLE:[A community acquired pneumonia case caused by Ralstonia pickettii].
ABSTRACT:Ralstonia pickettii, formerly known as Burkholderia pickettii, is a non-fermentative gram-negative bacillus. It is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen both in the hospital setting and in the environment, leading to outbreaks especially in the intensive care units. The available literature revealed two case reports of pneumonia associated with R. pickettii in adults. In this report, a case of pneumoniae due to R. pickettii, in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was presented. Fifty-six years old male patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of shortness of breath, cough, purulent sputum, weakness, fatigue and green colorred diarrhea lacking blood. Lung auscultation revealed decreased respiratory sounds in the right lower lobe. Laboratory findings yielded decreased arterial pH and paO2 and increased pCO2 values, while hemoglobin, hematocrite, blood urea and creatinine levels were increased. Chest X-ray showed an infiltration on right lower zone. The patient was intubated and imipenem 1 x 500 mg/day and netilmicin 1 x 80 mg/day were initiated. Deep tracheal aspirate specimen revealed gram-negative rods and leukocytes, and cultures yielded growth of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli on blood agar and EMB agar. These bacilli were identified as R. pickettii by using VITEK 2 system (bi-oMerieux Inc, Mercy L'etoil, France). Antibiotic sensitivity test performed by VITEK 2 GP system (bioMerieux Inc, Mercy L'etoil, France) revealed sensitivity to ceftriaxone, imipenem/cilastatin, piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, cefoperazone-sulbactam and ciprofloxacin. Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was continued for 14 days and the patient was completely recovered. This case was presented in order to call attention to R. pickettii as a pathogen that may cause community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection.

TITLE:Lung abscess caused by Legionella species: implication of the immune status of hosts.
ABSTRACT:Legionella pneumonia typically presents as lobar pneumonia with multiple-lobe involvement, but Legionella lung abscess is rare. To identify the predisposing factors for Legionella abscess, we analyzed 62 of the 79 case reports on Legionella abscess found in literature; 28 (45.2%) were of hospital-acquired infection and 28 (45.2%), community-acquired infection. Seventeen patients (27.4%) died. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the most common, but other serogroups of L. pneumophila, L. micdadei, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, and L. maceachernii were also isolated from the abscess. Corticosteroids were administered for underlying diseases to 43 (69.4%) patients. Peripheral neutrophil counts were higher in patients with abscess than in those with only pulmonary infiltration. In certain cases, Legionella abscess developed during neutropenia recovery. However, lymphocyte counts were low in most cases. Clinical factors like corticosteroid treatment, which causes impaired cellular immunity and subsequent neutrophil accumulation in the lesion, might function as predisposing factors for Legionella abscess.

摘要:军团菌肺炎典型表现为大叶性肺炎并累及多叶，但军团菌肺脓肿少见。为确定军团菌脓肿的易感因素，我们分析了文献报道的79例军团菌脓肿中的62例;医院感染28例(45.2%)，社区感染28例(45.2%)。17例(27.4%)死亡。脓肿中以嗜肺L.血清组1最常见，但也分离到嗜肺L.、米达克代L.、博泽曼L.、杜莫菲L.和麦氏L.。对43名(69.4%)患者使用糖皮质激素治疗基础疾病。脓肿患者外周血中性粒细胞计数高于单纯肺浸润患者。在某些病例中，军团菌脓肿是在嗜中性白血球减少症恢复期间发生的。然而，淋巴细胞计数在大多数情况下是低的。临床因素如皮质类固醇治疗，可导致细胞免疫功能受损和随后的中性粒细胞在病灶积聚，可能是军团菌脓肿的易感性因素。"

TITLE:[A case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Cupriavidus pauculus].
ABSTRACT:Cupriavidus pauculus (formerly CDC Group IVc-2) is a non-fermentative, motile, gram-negative bacillus, rarely associated with human infections. It has been isolated from water, water from ultrafiltration systems and bottled mineral water. To date, 19 cases of bacteremia, two cases of peritonitis and one case of tenosynovitis associated with C. pauculus have been reported in English literature. In this paper, we report the first case of C. pauculus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in Turkey. A 47 years-old female with breast cancer was performed total mastectomy six years ago and received six cures of chemotherapy after surgery. The patient was hospitalized in medical oncology clinic with complaints of weight loss, nausea and vomiting for one year. Since she had problems of consiousness, dysphagia and pitosis, lumbar puncture was performed to rule out central nervous system infection or metastasis. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed upon the examination of Indian-ink stained smear of cerebrospinal fluid and amphotericin B was initiated. On the 11th day of her follow up, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred to pulmonary intensive care and underwent invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) therapy. On the 4th day of IMV; a new infiltration was detected on the upper zone of chest X-ray in addition to fever (38.3 degrees C) and intense endotracheal secretion. Therefore, bronchoscopic examination was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscope aspiration materials were obtained and cultivated. Bacteria grown at blood agar and EMB agar after 48 hours of incubation were stained as gram-negative bacilli and identified as C. pauculus by VITEK 2 compact system (bioMerieux Inc, USA). The strain was susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacilin/tazobactam and resistant to amikacin. The case was considered as C. pauculus VAP and imipenem (500 mg, 4 x 1) for 14 days was initiated. Clinical and microbiological resolution was achieved by imipenem therapy. In conclusion, rare pathogens like C. pauculus should be considered among the possible causative agents in infections that develop in immunocompromised host.

ABSTRACT:A 28-year-old Cambodian man with a history of congenital heart disease presented with a 6-month history of increasing fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss. His surgical history included two Blalock-Taussig shunts, ventricular septal defect closure, and placement of a pulmonary valve conduit via a Rastelli procedure. Echocardiographic and cardiac computed tomographic studies revealed a vegetation in the pulmonary homograft. Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods that were eventually identified as Suttonella indologenes. The patient underwent a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, which was complicated by septic pulmonary embolism that clinically resolved. Bacterial endocarditis caused by aerobic gram-negative organisms is uncommon. The authors report the first case of S. indologenes endocarditis in a patient with complex congenital heart disease.

TITLE:Two Legionnaires' disease cases associated with industrial waste water treatment plants: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Finnish and Swedish waste water systems used by the forest industry were found to be exceptionally heavily contaminated with legionellae in 2005. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of severe pneumonia in employees working at two separate mills in Finland in 2006. Legionella serological and urinary antigen tests were used to diagnose Legionnaires' disease in the symptomatic employees, who had worked at, or close to, waste water treatment plants. Since the findings indicated a Legionella infection, the waste water and home water systems were studied in more detail. The antibody response and Legionella urinary antigen finding of Case A indicated that the infection had been caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Case A had been exposed to legionellae while installing a pump into a post-clarification basin at the waste water treatment plant of mill A. Both the water and sludge in the basin contained high concentrations of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, in addition to serogroups 3 and 13. Case B was working 200 meters downwind from a waste water treatment plant, which had an active sludge basin and cooling towers. The antibody response indicated that his disease was due to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2. The cooling tower was the only site at the waste water treatment plant yielding that serogroup, though water in the active sludge basin yielded abundant growth of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 5 and Legionella rubrilucens. Both workers recovered from the disease. 
CONCLUSION: These are the first reported cases of Legionnaires' disease in Finland associated with industrial waste water systems.

TITLE:Virulence of an emerging respiratory pathogen, genus Pandoraea, in vivo and its interactions with lung epithelial cells.
ABSTRACT:Pandoraea species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens among cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF patients. Pandoraea pulmonicola is the predominant Pandoraea species among Irish CF patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the pathogenicity and potential mechanisms of virulence of Irish P. pulmonicola isolates and strains from other Pandoraea species. Three patients from whom the P. pulmonicola isolates were isolated have since died. The in vivo virulence of these and other Pandoraea strains was examined by determining the ability to kill Galleria mellonella larvae. The P. pulmonicola strains generally were the most virulent of the species tested, with three showing a comparable or greater level of virulence in vivo relative to another CF pathogen, Burkholderia cenocepacia, whilst strains from two other species, Pandoraea apista and Pandoraea pnomenusa, were considerably less virulent. For all Pandoraea species, whole cells were required for larval killing, as cell-free supernatants had little effect on larval survival. Overall, invasive Pandoraea strains showed comparable invasion of two independent lung epithelial cell lines, irrespective of whether they had a CF phenotype. Pandoraea strains were also capable of translocation across polarized lung epithelial cell monolayers. Although protease secretion was a common characteristic across the genus, it is unlikely to be involved in pathogenesis. In conclusion, whilst multiple mechanisms of pathogenicity may exist across the genus Pandoraea, it appears that lung cell invasion and translocation contribute to the virulence of P. pulmonicola strains.

摘要:Pandoraea作为机会致病菌出现在囊性纤维化(CF)和非CF患者中。在爱尔兰CF患者中，肺潘多拉菌是主要的潘多拉菌种类。本研究的目的是研究爱尔兰肺叶假单胞菌分离株和其他潘多拉菌菌株的致病性和潜在的毒力机制。三名从其身上分离出肺支原菌的患者已经死亡。通过测定对黑胸Galleria mellonella幼虫的杀伤能力，检测了这些和其他Pandoraea菌株的体内毒力。肺部疟原虫的毒力最高，其中3株体内毒力与另一种致病菌cenocepacia相当或更高，而来自apista Pandoraea和panoraea nomenusa的毒力则低得多。所有Pandoraea都需要全细胞才能杀死幼虫，因为无细胞上清对幼虫存活率影响不大。总的来说，侵袭性Pandoraea菌株表现出两种独立的肺上皮细胞系具有相当的侵袭性，无论它们是否具有CF表型。Pandoraea菌株也能够在极化的肺上皮细胞单层中易位。虽然蛋白酶分泌是该属的共同特征，但它不太可能参与发病机制。综上所述，虽然Pandoraea属可能存在多种致病机制，但肺细胞的侵袭和易位可能对P. pulmonicola菌株的毒力有贡献。"

ABSTRACT:We report the repeated isolation of Bordetella petrii in the sputum of a 79-year-old female patient with diffuse bronchiectasis and persistence of the bacterium for &gt;1 year. The patient was first hospitalized due to dyspnea, which developed into severe cough with purulent sputum that yielded B. petrii on culture. After this first episode, the patient was hospitalized an additional 4 times with bronchorrhea symptoms. The isolates collected were analyzed by using biochemical, genotypic, and proteomic tools. Expression of specific proteins was analyzed by using serum samples from the patient. The B. petrii isolates were compared with other B. petrii isolates collected from humans or the environment and with isolates of B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii, obtained from human respiratory tract infections. Our observations indicate that B. petrii can persist in persons with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease as has been previously demonstrated for B. bronchiseptica.

TITLE:Lobar pneumonia caused by Ralstonia pickettii in a sixty-five-year-old Han Chinese man: a case report.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Ralstonia pickettii is a gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus and is an emerging pathogen found in infections described in hospital settings. The cases reported in the literature mostly are nosocomial infections due to contaminated blood products, sterile water, saline, treatment fluids and venous catheters. Human infection unrelated to contaminated solutions is rare. We report a case of lobar pneumonia and pulmonary abscess caused by Ralstonia pickettii in an older patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A sixty-five-year old Han Chinese man presented having had cough, expectoration, chest pain and fever lasting for twenty days. His medical history was notable for hypertension over the previous ten years, and the habit of smoking for forty years. A thoracic computed tomography scan supported the diagnosis of right-sided lobar pneumonia. A lung biopsy was done and pathological analysis confirmed lobar pneumonia. Two lung biopsy specimens from separate sites grew Ralstonia pickettii. After six days, a repeat thoracic scan revealed a right-sided abscess. A thoracentesis was performed and the purulent fluid grew Ralstonia pickettii. The chest tube remained inserted to rinse the cavity with sterile sodium chloride. He received an antibiotic course of intravenous cefoperazone sodium-sulbactam sodium for eighteen days and imipenem-cilastatin for twelve days. A repeat chest X-ray revealed resolution of the pulmonary abscess and improvement of pneumonia. He remained afebrile and free of respiratory symptoms after treatments. 
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates a Ralstonia pickettii infection in the absence of an obvious nosocomial source. It is possible that such cases will become common in the future. Therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate its sensitivity to common antibiotics.

TITLE:[Pandoraea sputorum colonization in a patient with cystic fibrosis].
ABSTRACT:Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease produced by a defect in the transmembrane conductance regulator protein, CFTR. Currently, the morbidity and mortality associated with CF are fundamentally related with the lung affectation that is a consequence of this defect. With the progression of the disease, there is an increase in the isolation of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli colonizing these patients. The genus Pandoraea arises from a reclassification of species included within the ""Burkholderia cepacia complex"". It is made up of 9 species susceptible only to tetracycline, imipenem and cotrimoxazole. We report the first clinical case in Spain of colonization by Pandoraea sputorum in a patient diagnosed with CF at the age of eleven. After several previous colonizations by different Pseudomonas species in September 2005, a gram-negative bacillus was isolated in sputum, which was identified by sequencing and mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) as P. sputorum, only sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam, cotrimoxazole and imipenem. From 2005 to 2008, chronic colonization by this microorganism was associated with deterioration in lung function that was recuperated after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. In 2010, this microorganism was once again isolated and treated with imipenem, to which the patient responded favorably. Currently, it is not known whether this microorganism is a chronic colonizer, whether it produces a transitory infection or whether it constitutes an important problem in CF patients, but given its special characteristics of sensitivity to anti-microbial drugs, the correct identification of this genus is essential. Mass spectrometry seems to be a valid technique that is faster than sequencing methods for identifying these species.

ABSTRACT:Serratia ficaria was first described in 1979 as a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod. S. ficaria was found in figs, but also isolated from human specimens in a few cases. We now report an isolate of S. ficaria from sputum specimen.A 46-year-old man was suffering from a chronic renal failure of five years, four months of peritoneal dialysis and one week of fever due to respiratory tract infection, accompanied by cough. Sputum culture yielded a Gram-negative rod. It was identified as S. ficaria and the antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by automated Vitek II (bioMerieux). The tested S. ficaria strain was susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, cefepime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, imipenem, meropenem, tigecycline and ciprofloxacin. This strain was resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitine, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone. The patient was treated successfully (80 mg trimethoprim/400 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily for 7 days)S. ficaria is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for intestinal colonization or serious infections such as septicaemia, gall bladder empyema in immunocompromised patients. The fig tree and fig play an important role in human colonization. It should be remembered that S. ficaria infections may be encountered frequently especially in fig tree culture zones.

ABSTRACT:Pantoea species, which are the members of Enterobacteriaceae family are gram-negative bacilli that are frequently found on many plants and in soil. They may lead to localized infections in healthy subjects and systemic infections in immunosuppressed patients. In this case report a ventilator-associated pneumoniae due to Pantoea agglomerans was presented. A 55 year-old male patient with chronic renal failure was hospitalized in intensive care unit following cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient developed fever (38.8 C), had pulmonary infiltrations in chest X-ray and leucocytosis. Treatment with piperacillintazobactam was initiated upon diagnosis of nosocomial pneumoniae. Bacterial growth from the deep tracheal aspirate of the patient was identified as P.agglomerans by VITEK2 automated system (bioMerieux, France) and the identification was confirmed by conventional microbiological methods. Since the strain was susceptible to the cephoperazon-sulbactam, tobramycin, tetracycline, gentamicin and levofloxacine, the treatment was changed to levofloxacine and cephoperazon-sulbactam and the patient improved. This case was presented to withdraw attention to rare opportunistic pathogens that may lead to nosocomial infections particularly in patients with underlying diseases.

ABSTRACT:Pneumatocele formation is a known complication of pneumonia. Very rarely, they may increase markedly in size, causing cardiorespiratory compromise. Many organisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease; however, this is the first report of tension pneumatocele resulting from Enterobacter gergoviae pneumonia. We report a case of a 3-month-old Nigerian male child who developed two massive tension pneumatoceles while on treatment for postpneumonic empyema due to Enterobacter gergoviae pneumonia. Tube thoracostomy directed into both pneumatocele resulted in complete resolution and recovery. Enterobacter gergoviae is a relevant human pathogen, capable of causing complicated pneumonia with fatal outcome if not properly managed. In developing countries where state-of the-art radiological facilities and expertise for prompt thoracic intervention are lacking, there is still room for nonoperative management of tension pneumatocele especially in very ill children.

TITLE:Serologic prevalence of amoeba-associated microorganisms in intensive care unit pneumonia patients.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to intensive care units are frequently exposed to pathogenic microorganisms present in their environment. Exposure to these microbes may lead to the development of hospital-acquired infections that complicate the illness and may be fatal. Amoeba-associated microorganisms (AAMs) are frequently isolated from hospital water networks and are reported to be associated to cases of community and hospital-acquired pneumonia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS: We used a multiplexed immunofluorescence assay to test for the presence of antibodies against AAMs in sera of intensive care unit (ICU) pneumonia patients and compared to patients at the admission to the ICU (controls). Our results show that some AAMs may be more frequently detected in patients who had hospital-acquired pneumonia than in controls, whereas other AAMs are ubiquitously detected. However, ICU patients seem to exhibit increasing immune response to AAMs when the ICU stay is prolonged. Moreover, concomitant antibodies responses against seven different microorganisms (5 Rhizobiales, Balneatrix alpica, and Mimivirus) were observed in the serum of patients that had a prolonged ICU stay. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our work partially confirms the results of previous studies, which show that ICU patients would be exposed to water amoeba-associated microorganisms, and provides information about the magnitude of AAM infection in ICU patients, especially patients that have a prolonged ICU stay. However, the incidence of this exposure on the development of pneumonia remains to assess.

研究结果:我们使用多重免疫荧光法检测重症监护病房(ICU)肺炎患者血清中AAMs抗体的存在，并与ICU住院患者(对照组)进行比较。我们的研究结果表明，与对照组相比，一些AAMs可能在医院获得性肺炎患者中更经常被检测到，而其他AAMs则普遍被检测到。然而，ICU患者在ICU停留的时间延长时，似乎对急性淋巴细胞白血病的免疫反应增加。此外，在ICU住院时间较长的患者的血清中观察到伴随的抗七种不同微生物的抗体反应(5种根瘤菌、羊齿Balneatrix羊齿balpica和Mimivirus)。

ABSTRACT:We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with pneumonia caused by Aeromonas species. Patients with pneumonia caused by Aeromonas species during the period 2004 to 2011 were identified from a computerized database of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 84 patients with pneumonia due to Aeromonas species, possible Aeromonas pneumonia was diagnosed in 58 patients, probable Aeromonas pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 patients, and pneumonia due to Aeromonas was conclusively diagnosed in 8 patients. Most of the cases of Aeromonas pneumonia developed in men and in patients of advanced age. A. hydrophila (n = 50, 59.5 %) was the most common pathogen, followed by A. caviae (n = 24, 28.6 %), A. veronii biovar sobria (n = 7, 8.3 %), and A. veronii biovar veronii (n = 3, 3.6 %). Cancer (n = 37, 44.0 %) was the most common underlying disease, followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 27, 32.1 %). Drowning-associated pneumonia developed in 6 (7.1 %) patients. Of 47 patients who were admitted to the intensive care ward, 42 patients developed acute respiratory failure and 24 of those patients died. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was significantly associated with liver cirrhosis, cancer, initial presentation of shock, and usage of mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, Aeromonas species should be considered as one of the causative pathogens of severe pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised patients, and should be recognized as a cause of drowning-associated pneumonia. Cirrhosis, cancer, and shock as the initial presenting symptom are associated with poor outcome.

ABSTRACT:Among 82 clinical isolates of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex recovered in 13 hospitals of Sichuan, China, in 2011, 13 were Acinetobacter pittii and 2 were Acinetobacter nosocomialis. Multilocus sequence typing revealed a novel sequence type (ST) of A. nosocomialis and 7 novel STs of A. pittii. Most isolates were hospital-acquired and colonized in the respiratory tract, while 6 cases with pneumonia due to A. pittii were identified. This study provided a snapshot of the local incidence of A. pittii and A. nosocomialis.

ABSTRACT:Following a bloodstream infection in June 2011 with Ralstonia mannitolilytica in a premature infant treated with a humidifying respiratory therapy device, an investigation was initiated at the Hadassah Medical Centres in Jerusalem. The device delivers a warmed and humidified mixture of air and oxygen to patients by nasal cannula. The investigation revealed colonisation with R. mannitolilytica of two of 15 patients and contamination of components of five of six devices deployed in the premature units of the Hadassah hospitals. Ten isolates from the investigation were highly related and indistinguishable from isolates described in an outbreak in 2005 in the United States (US). Measures successful in containing the US outbreak were not included in user instructions provided to our hospitals by the distributor of the device.

TITLE:Adaptability and persistence of the emerging pathogen Bordetella petrii.
ABSTRACT:The first described, environmentally isolated, Bordetella petrii was shown to undergo massive genomic rearrangements in vitro. More recently, B. petrii was isolated from clinical samples associated with jaw, ear bone, cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary disease. However, the in vivo consequences of B. petrii genome plasticity and its pathogenicity remain obscure. B. petrii was identified from four sequential respiratory samples and a post-mortem spleen sample of a woman presenting with bronchiectasis and cavitary lung disease associated with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Strains were compared genetically, phenotypically and by antibody recognition from the patient and from inoculated mice. The successive B. petrii strains exhibited differences in growth, antibiotic susceptibility and recognition by the patient's antibodies. Antibodies from mice inoculated with these strains recapitulated the specificity and strain dependent response that was seen with the patient's serum. Finally, we characterize one strain that was poorly recognized by the patient's antibodies, due to a defect in the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, and identify a mutation associated with this phenotype. We propose that B. petrii is remarkably adaptable in vivo, providing a possible connection between immune response and bacterial evasion and supporting infection persistence.

TITLE:16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND AND 
OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. 
RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. 
CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.

目的:慢性阻塞性肺疾病(AE-COPD)急性加重是医院重症监护病房死亡的主要原因。我们试图确定牙菌斑生物膜是否可能含有最终导致严重AE-COPD患者肺部感染的致病菌。材料和
方法:收集53例重症AE-COPD患者的龈下菌斑生物膜和气管抽吸标本。分别从每个样本中提取细菌总DNA，进行聚合酶链反应扩增和/或生成细菌16S rDNA序列和cDNA文库。我们使用基于细菌16S rDNA序列的宏基因组学方法来比较牙菌斑和肺中物种的分布。
结果:对1060个序列(每个病人20个克隆)的分析显示了广泛的好氧、厌氧、致病性、机会性、新型和不可培养的细菌种类。物种之间的配对所用龈下的牙菌斑和气管吸入样本(97 - 16 s rDNA序列相似度100%)是牙菌斑病原体(Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella连翘和梅毒denticola)和肺病原体(鲍曼不动杆菌、肺炎克雷伯菌、铜绿假单胞菌和肺炎链球菌)。16S rDNA实时聚合酶链反应显示，与配对的气管抽吸标本相比，铜绿假单胞菌和牙龈卟啉单胞菌在牙菌斑上的定植水平较低。
结论:这些结果支持了牙齿细菌可能参与严重AE-COPD病理的假设。"

ABSTRACT:Infection with Burkholderia species is typically considered a contraindication leading to transplantation in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the risks posed by different Burkholderia species on transplantation outcomes are poorly defined. We present the case of a patient with CF who underwent lung transplantation due to a severe respiratory failure from chronic airways infection with Burkholderia pyrrocinia (B. cepacia genomovar IX) and pan-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent B. pyrrocinia infections, ultimately lea ding to uncontrollable sepsis and death. This is the first case report in CF of Burkholderia pyrrocinia infection and lung transplantation, providing further evidence of the high risk nature of the Burkholderia species.

ABSTRACT:Oligella ureolytica is an emerging bacteria rarely implicated as a human pathogen. It is infrequently recovered from clinical specimens probably because of inadequate processing of non-fermenting oxidase positive Gram negative bacilli. We present here a case of a 30 year old male suffering from right lung adenocarcinoma (moderately differentiated) with multiple abdominal lymph node metastasis with Syringohydromyelia whose blood culture yielded Oligella ureolytica in pure culture. Oligella ureolytica isolation in pure culture and the patient's response to targeted treatment supported that Oligella ureolytica was the true causative agent of the blood stream infection. Early suspicion, diagnosis and treatment with potent antibiotics are needed to prevent further complications resulting from infection with this emerging pathogen.

TITLE:Antibiotic treatment following a dog bite in an immunocompromized patient in order to prevent Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium found in the saliva of dogs and cats. Clinically significant infections in humans after a bite are often associated with the presence of immune deficiency. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient survival. In addition, patients with immune deficiency are susceptible to serious life-threatening nosocomial infections, which may also influence the prognosis of patients with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation after suffering two small bites from her dog. She had received a splenectomy during childhood. The patient survived after early empiric treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive care, including ventilation support, a high dose of noradrenalin, and continuous venovenous hemodialysis applied prior to the definitive diagnosis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. She improved within 2 weeks but, despite all efforts to prevent nosocomial infection, her hospital course was complicated by Enterococcus species and Candida albicans pleuropneumonia that prolonged her stay in the intensive care unit, and necessitated ventilation support for 2 months. 
CONCLUSION: Severe Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis may be complicated by life-threatening nosocomial infection in immunocompromized patients. The prophylactic application of antibiotics after a dog bite should be considered in high-risk individuals with immune deficiency in order to prevent both Capnocytophyga canimorsus sepsis and serious nosocomial complications.

TITLE:Aeromonas sobria necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis in an immunocompromised patient: a case report and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria is a rare cause of bacteremia, with several studies indicating that this isolate may be of particular clinical significance since it is enterotoxin producing. A wide spectrum of infections has been associated with Aeromonas species in developing countries that include gastroenteritis, wound infections, septicemia and lung infections. This infection, caused by Aeromonas species, is usually more severe in immunocompromised than immunocompetent individuals. We here describe a case of soft tissue infection and severe sepsis due to Aeromonas sobria in an immunocompromised patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old Caucasian man with a clinical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immune thrombocytopenia, periodically treated with steroids, was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit because of necrotizing fasciitis and multiorgan failure due to Aeromonas sobria, which resulted in his death. The unfortunate coexistence of a Candida albicans infection played a key role in the clinical course. 
CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical therapy are determinants in the treatment of severe septicemia caused by an Aeromonas sobria in an immunocompromised patient.

ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas stutzeri (P. stutzeri) is a Gram-negative, non-fermenting rod. It is a rare pathogen; therefore, its isolation is often associated with colonization or contamination. We herein describe the first reported case of necrotizing pneumonia caused by P. stutzeri in a non-HIV infected patient with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. The isolate was found to be antibiotic resistant, which led to the failure of the initial treatment. This case highlights the unique presentation of necrotizing pneumonia caused by P. stutzeri and the importance of emerging antimicrobial resistance in P. stutzeri.

TITLE:Kerstersia gyiorum Isolated from a Bronchoalveolar Lavage in a Patient with a Chronic Tracheostomy.
ABSTRACT:The use of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) generates rapid microbial identification. We are presenting a case of a 63-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic tracheostomy admitted for hypotension and fevers to illustrate the clinical implication of MALDI-TOF MS on bacterial identification. Kerstersia gyiorum was identified from the bronchoalveolar lavage isolate. Kerstersia gyiorum has been isolated from human sputum samples, and may be a previously unrecognized colonizer of the upper respiratory tract. Thus, patients with long-term tracheotomies or who are chronically aspirating may be at risk of lower respiratory infection with this organism. Increased use of MALDI-TOF MS in the clinical setting may increase reporting of this atypical isolate.

ABSTRACT:In August 2013, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency was notified of a fatal case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a previously healthy male, aged 10 years, who owned pet rats. Two days before his death, the patient experienced rigors, fevers, vomiting, headaches, and leg pains. His physician noted a fever of 102.6 F (39.2oC), documented a normal examination, diagnosed viral gastroenteritis, and prescribed anti-nausea medication. During the next 24 hours, the patient experienced vomiting and persistent fever. He was confused and weak before collapsing at home. Paramedics reported the patient was unresponsive and had dilated pupils; resuscitation was initiated in the field and was continued for &gt;1 hour after arrival at the emergency department but was unsuccessful. A complete blood count performed during resuscitation revealed anemia (hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL [normal = 13.5-18.0 g/dL], thrombocytopenia (platelets 40,000/microL [normal = 140,000-440,000/microL]), leukocytosis (white blood cells 17,900 cells/microL [normal = 4,000-10,500/microL]) with 16% band neutrophils; the patient also had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

TITLE:Microbiological and Clinical Studies of Legionellosis in 33 Patients with Cancer.
ABSTRACT:Legionella, a large group of environmental Gram-negative bacteria, represents an occasional cause of pneumonia. We analyzed the microbiological and clinical features of 33 consecutive cases of Legionella infections that occurred at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, from 2002 to 2014. The Legionella strains were isolated from bronchoscopy specimens (32 strains) and a blood culture (1 strain) and were identified by sequencing analysis of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. The 33 strains involved 12 Legionella species or subspecies: 15 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, 3 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri or L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei, 4 strains of ""L. donaldsonii,"" 3 strains of L. micdadei, and one each of L. bozemanae, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. parisiensis, L. sainthelensi, and Legionella sp. strain D5382. All patients except one asymptomatic carrier showed pneumonia, including one with concurrent bacteremia. Nine patients died, with this infection being the immediate cause of death in six. Twenty-seven patients had underlying hematologic malignancies. Twenty-three patients were leukopenic. Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp. D5382 are likely the first reports of human infection with these organisms.

TITLE:Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a high school teacher.
ABSTRACT:Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an inflammatory lung disease mediated by an immunological response to an inhaled antigen. Outbreaks of HP have been reported in industrial settings where manufacturing workers are exposed to water-based metalworking fluids (MWFs). Water-based MWFs promote growth of microorganisms and can be easily aerosolized and are thus potential aetiological agents of HP. We present a case of HP caused by exposure to water-based MWF in a vocational high school teacher. Culture of MWF used at his school grew Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes. This is the first known report of MWF-induced HP outside an industrial setting. The growth of Pseudomonas spp in this case recalls the earliest reports of the microbiology of MWF-induced HP and suggests that routine bacterial culture may be useful in the diagnosis of HP in workplaces without standard cleaning and biocide regulations.

TITLE:Delftia acidovorans: A rare pathogen in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.
ABSTRACT:Delftia acidovorans is an aerobic, nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus. It is usually a nonpathogenic environmental organism and is rarely clinically significant. Although D acidovorans infection most commonly occurs in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients, there are also several reports documenting the infection in immunocompetent patients. The present article describes a B cell lymphoblastic leukemia patient with D acidovorans pneumonia who was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy. The present report indicates that unusual pathogens may be clinically significant in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. D acidovorans is often resistant to aminoglycosides; therefore, rapid detection of this microorganism is important.

题目:嗜酸多夫胺:免疫活性和免疫功能低下患者的罕见病原体。
摘要:Delftia acidovorans是一种需氧非发酵革兰氏阴性杆菌。它通常是一种非致病的环境微生物，很少有临床意义。虽然酸福菌感染最常发生在住院或免疫功能低下的患者中，也有一些报告记录免疫能力强的患者感染。本文描述了一例B细胞淋巴母细胞白血病伴D型酸中毒肺炎患者成功地应用抗生素治疗。本报告指出，不同寻常的病原体可能在免疫功能低下和免疫能力强的患者中具有临床意义。D酸多夫胺通常对氨基糖苷类有抗性;因此，快速检测这种微生物是很重要的。"

TITLE:Molecular diagnosis of Legionella infections--Clinical utility of front-line screening as part of a pneumonia diagnostic algorithm.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: Urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the leading rapid diagnostic test for Legionnaires' Disease (LD); however other Legionella species and serogroups can also cause LD. The aim was to determine the utility of front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR in a severe respiratory infection algorithm. 
METHODS: L. pneumophila and Legionella species duplex real-time PCR was carried out on 1944 specimens from hospitalised patients over a 4 year period in Edinburgh, UK. 
RESULTS: L. pneumophila was detected by PCR in 49 (2.7%) specimens from 36 patients. During a LD outbreak, combined L. pneumophila respiratory PCR and urinary antigen testing had optimal sensitivity and specificity (92.6% and 98.3% respectively) for the detection of confirmed cases. Legionella species was detected by PCR in 16 (0.9%) specimens from 10 patients. The 5 confirmed and 1 probable cases of Legionella longbeachae LD were both PCR and antibody positive. 
CONCLUSIONS: Front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR is a valuable addition to urinary antigen testing as part of a well-defined algorithm. Cases of LD due to L. longbeachae might be considered laboratory-confirmed when there is a positive Legionella species PCR result and detection of L. longbeachae specific antibody response.

标题:军团菌感染的分子诊断-作为肺炎诊断算法的一部分的一线筛查的临床应用。
摘要:目的:嗜肺军团菌血清群1尿抗原检测是目前领先的军团病(LD)快速诊断检测方法;然而，其他军团菌种和血清群也可能导致LD。目的是确定一线嗜肺性军团菌和军团菌种PCR在严重呼吸道感染算法中的效用。
方法:对英国爱丁堡4年住院患者的1944例标本进行嗜肺L.肺炎菌和军团菌双实时荧光定量PCR检测。
结果:PCR检测36例患者49例(2.7%)标本中检出嗜肺L.;在一次LD暴发中，肺炎链球菌呼吸道PCR和尿抗原联合检测确诊病例的敏感性和特异性分别为92.6%和98.3%。PCR检测10例患者16份(0.9%)军团菌。5例龙滩军团菌确诊病例和1例龙滩军团菌疑似病例均为PCR阳性和抗体阳性。
结论:作为定义明确的算法的一部分，前线嗜肺性L.和军团菌种PCR是尿抗原检测的一个有价值的补充。当军团菌PCR结果阳性，且检测到龙贝弓形虫特异性抗体反应时，可认为龙贝弓形虫引起的LD病例已得到实验室确认。"

TITLE:Community-Acquired Pneumonia and Empyema Caused by Citrobacter koseri in an Immunocompetent Patient.
ABSTRACT:Citrobacter species, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, are environmental organisms commonly found in soil, water, and the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Citrobacter koseri is known to be an uncommon but serious cause of both sporadic and epidemic septicemia and meningitis in neonates and young infants. Most cases reported have occurred in immunocompromised hosts. The infections caused by Citrobacter are difficult to treat with usual broad spectrum antibiotics owing to rapid generation of mutants and have been associated with high death rates in the past. We believe this is the first case described in the literature of a community-acquired pneumonia and empyema caused by Citrobacter koseri in an immunocompetent adult patient.

TITLE:Epidemic spread of Pandoraea pulmonicola in a cystic fibrosis center.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pandoraea spp. are recently discovered bacteria, mainly recovered from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, but their epidemiology and clinical significance are not well known. We describe an epidemic spread of Pandoraea pulmonicola from 2009 in our CF center, involving 6 out of 243 CF patients. 
METHODS: Bacterial identification used amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The clonal link between strains was assessed with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using XbaI. Clinical data were gathered for all patients. 
RESULTS: The index case was chronically colonized since 2000. The main hypothesis for this bacterial spread was a droplet cross-transmission, due to preventive measures not being strictly followed. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin and colistin. However, there was susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the acquisition of P. pulmonicola resulted in chronic colonization in all patients. Three patients died, and two patients remained clinically stable, whereas one patient had a decline in lung function. 
CONCLUSIONS: This study, which is the first to describe an epidemic spread of P. pulmonicola, notes the potential transmissibility of this bacterial species and the need for infection control measures.

方法:细菌鉴定采用扩增核糖体DNA限制分析(addra)、MALDI-TOF质谱(MALDI-TOF MS)和16S rDNA基因测序。XbaI应用脉冲场凝胶电泳(PFGE)技术检测菌株间的克隆联系。收集所有患者的临床资料。
结果:2000年以来，首例慢性殖民。由于没有严格执行预防措施，这种细菌传播的主要假设是通过飞沫交叉传播。药敏试验显示对-内酰胺类、环丙沙星和粘菌素耐药。但对甲氧苄啶-磺胺甲恶唑有敏感性。所有患者均慢性定植铜绿假单胞菌，而获得的P.肺菌导致所有患者的慢性定植。3例死亡，2例临床稳定，1例肺功能下降。
结论:本研究首次描述了肺炎支原体的流行，指出了这种细菌的潜在传播能力和需要采取感染控制措施。"

TITLE:Distribution of the species of Achromobacter in a French Cystic Fibrosis Centre and multilocus sequence typing analysis reveal the predominance of A. xylosoxidans and clonal relationships between some clinical and environmental isolates.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Achromobacter spp. are emerging pathogens in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Recent studies proposed Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme and a species-level identification method by nrdA sequencing for this genus. Epidemiological data are needed to assess the species and/or the sequence types (STs) involved and their potential role in CF patients lung function degradation. The aims of this study were i) to describe the distribution of the different species of Achromobacter in our CF centre ii) to detect potential STs more involved in chronic colonisations iii) to detect a potential local or worldwide predominance of some STs among clinical and environmental isolates. 
METHODS: All the isolates (477) collected in our CF centre from 2007 to 2014 among the 177 patients attending the centre were identified using nrdA sequencing. MLST analysis was performed for 37 clinical and 14 environmental isolates. 
RESULTS: A total of 47 out of 177 patients presented positive culture(s) with Achromobacter spp., representing 12.7% of the patients of the centre each year. Eleven species were detected, A. xylosoxidans being the most prevalent species (27 patients). Only A. xylosoxidans (&gt;80%) and A. insuavis were involved in chronic colonisation (6.7%). MLST analysis revealed a wide diversity among the isolates (36 STs for 51 isolates). Nevertheless, one third of the isolates belonged to STs previously detected in clinical isolates from other countries. 
CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first approach in understanding the global epidemiology of Achromobacter species in CF. These results confirm the high prevalence of the species A. xylosoxidans among CF patients, reveal the worldwide distribution of some STs and point out the potential role of environmental sources of contamination. More studies are needed to search for relationships between species and/or ST and pathogenicity.

背景:无色杆菌是囊性纤维化(CF)患者中出现的病原菌。最近的研究提出了多位点序列分型(MLST)方案和一种利用nrdA测序对该属植物进行种级鉴定的方法。需要流行病学数据来评估涉及的物种和/或序列类型(STs)及其在CF患者肺功能退化中的潜在作用。本研究的目的是:(1)描述我们CF中心不同种类的Achromobacter的分布;(2)检测潜在的与慢性定植有关的STs;(3)检测临床和环境分离的某些STs在当地或世界范围内的潜在优势。
方法:对2007年至2014年在CF中心就诊的177例患者中收集的所有分离株(477株)进行nrdA测序鉴定。对37例临床分离株和14例环境分离株进行MLST分析。
结果:177例患者中47例为无色杆菌阳性培养，占本中心每年患者总数的12.7%。共检出11种，其中木糖氧化酶属(A. xylosooxidans)最为常见(27例)。只有木糖氧化A.(80%)和A. insuavis参与了慢性定植(6.7%)。MLST分析显示，51株分离株中有36个STs。然而，三分之一的分离株属于以前在其他国家的临床分离株中检测到的STs。
结论:本研究是了解CF中无色杆菌种类的全球流行病学的第一个方法，这些结果证实了a . xylosooxidans在CF患者中的高患病率，揭示了世界指出了一些STs的广泛分布，并指出了环境污染源的潜在作用。需要更多的研究来寻找物种和/或ST与致病性之间的关系。"

TITLE:Emerging role of Raoultella ornithinolytica in human infections: a series of cases and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Raoultella ornithinolytica is known to inhabit aquatic environments. The clinical features and outcomes of human infections caused by R. ornithinolytica have been reported for only a limited number of cases. 
METHODS: A retrospective study of cases of infection caused by R. ornithinolytica managed at four university hospital centres during the period before and after the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed. The aim was to describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. 
RESULTS: Among 187 R. ornithinolytica isolates identified for which clinical information was available, 71 were considered colonizers and 116 were pathogenic. A total of 112 cases of R. ornithinolytica infection were identified. Urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, wound and skin infections, and bacteraemia were observed in 36%, 14%, 13%, and 5% of cases, respectively. Associated infections that have been poorly reported, such as respiratory infections, i.e. pneumonia and pleural effusion, were observed in 24% of cases. Additional diseases reported here for the first time included osteomyelitis, meningitis, cerebral abscess, mediastinitis, pericarditis, conjunctivitis, and otitis. The proportion of R. ornithinolytica isolates resistant to antibiotics was found to be relatively high: 4% of isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, 6% to quinolones, and 13% to co-trimoxazole. The mortality rate related to infection was 5%. 
CONCLUSIONS: R. ornithinolytica is an underreported, emerging hospital-acquired infection and is particularly associated with invasive procedures. R. ornithinolytica should never be considered simply a saprophytic bacterium that occasionally contaminates bronchial lavage or other deep respiratory samples or surgical sites. Physicians should be aware of the high rates of antimicrobial resistance of R. ornithinolytica isolates so that immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment can be established before accurate microbiological results are obtained.

方法:对4所大学医院中心应用基质辅助激光解吸/电离飞行时间质谱(MALDI-TOF MS)前后由溶鸟疟原虫引起的感染病例进行回顾性研究。目的是描述临床和微生物学特征、治疗和结果。
结果:在187株具有临床资料的溶鸟疟原虫分离株中，71株为定殖型，116株为致病性。共确诊112例溶鸟疟原虫感染。尿路感染、胃肠道感染、伤口和皮肤感染和菌血症的发生率分别为36%、14%、13%和5%。未报告的相关感染，如呼吸道感染，即肺炎和胸腔积液，在24%的病例中观察到。本文首次报道的其他疾病包括骨髓炎、脑膜炎、脑脓肿、纵隔炎、心包炎、结膜炎和耳炎。溶鸟疟原虫对抗生素的耐药率较高，对头孢曲松耐药率为4%，对喹诺酮类药物耐药率为6%，对复方新诺明耐药率为13%。与感染有关的死亡率为5%。
结论:溶鸟结核菌是一种未被充分报道的新兴医院获得性感染，尤其与侵入性手术相关。溶鸟僵菌不能简单地认为是一种偶尔污染支气管的腐生细菌al灌洗或其他深呼吸样本或手术部位。医生应该意识到溶鸟结核菌的高耐药性率，以便在获得准确的微生物学结果之前，可以立即建立广谱抗生素治疗。"

TITLE:Fatal transfusion-transmitted infection due to Citrobacter koseri.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI) is still one of the most feared complications of blood transfusion. CASE REPORT: We report a fatal case involving an 8-year-old child with congenital dyskeratosis complicated by severe aplastic anemia who was regularly transfused with platelet (PLT) concentrates for 5 years. The patient received an apheresis PLT concentrate (APC) on Day 0 due to thrombocytopenia complicated by mucocutaneous hemorrhage. Thirty minutes after the start of the transfusion, bradycardia and dyspnea appeared, quickly followed by chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, and hyperthermia. TTBI was suspected and the patient was immediately treated with intravascular antibiotherapy. On Day 3, the patient developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to death on Day 7. Patient blood cultures and APC cultures were both positive for Citrobacter koseri. 
RESULTS: The donor was a 19-year-old woman. She had previously given blood. No infectious symptom was reported during the medical interviews before and after the donation and no postdonation information was received. On the day of the donation (Day -2), her white blood cell count was 5.83 x 109 /L. She came back on Day 8 to undergo additional tests. The cultures from blood, stool, urine, the skin of the inside of the elbow at the point of needle insertion, and ear samples were all negative for C. koseri. However, a nasal sample was positive for C. koseri. 
CONCLUSION: The isolates from the donor's blood cultures, the APC bag, the attached tube, and the donor's nasal sample all gave identical profiles; they were thus identified as the same strain and the TTBI was confirmed.

ABSTRACT:Kluyvera cryocrescens infection has been considered rare; clinical features of K. cryocrescens bacteremia remain unclear because few reports have been published. We report a case of K. cryocrescens bacteremia in an adult male patient and review the literature. Our case was one with nosocomial bacteremia in a patient with interstitial lung disease. The primary infection site was undetermined, although he had an indwelling peripheral intravenous catheter and a urinary catheter. Piperacilin/tazobactam was administered for 2 weeks and the bacteremia resolved. Unfortunately, there was acute exacerbation of the interstitial lung disease, which was fatal. According to our review, including our case, K. cryocrescens bacteremia tends to occur in immunocompromised hosts, and indwelling catheters might be risk factors. Extended spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are generally adequate agents for empiric therapy based on susceptibilities of K. cryocrescens clinical isolates.

TITLE:First report of Wautersiella falsenii genomovar 2 isolated from the respiratory tract of an immunosuppressed man.
ABSTRACT:Wautersiella falsenii is a Gram-negative, non-motile rod, which grows aerobically on common isolation media and is the only acknowledged species among the genus Wautersiella. Two genomovars, namely 1 and 2, phenotypically indistinguishable but genotypically different, are described. To date, few case reports detailing the clinical disease associated with W. falsenii have been reported, all describing localized infection. To our knowledge, this study reports the first isolation of W. falsenii genomovar 2 from a respiratory sample of an immunosuppressed man. Our hypothesis is that the patient was harboring W. falsenii genomovar 2 and both the immunosuppression and the antimicrobial treatments provided a chance for this organism to emerge. The clinical significance of this result is yet to be evaluated. Although infection with W. falsenii remains rare, this bacterium should not be underestimated mainly because of its natural resistance to many available antimicrobials.

ABSTRACT:Pandoraea species are considered as emerging pathogens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The contribution of these organisms to disease progression in CF patients is not fully understood owing in large measure to the scant reports in clinical and research literature describing their colonization of CF patients and their associated virulence determinants. In an effort to increase awareness and evidence for Pandoraea spp. infection in people with CF, and to stimulate research aimed at unraveling the pathogenic properties of Pandoraea, we report a case of a 26-year-old Australian (Tasmanian) man with CF who was chronically infected with Pandoraea pnomenusa for at least one year prior to his death from respiratory failure. In addition, we describe for the first time evidence suggesting that this bacterium is a facultative anaerobe and report on the availability of a whole genome sequence for this organism. To the best of our knowledge, this report represents only the second clinical case study of P. pnomenusa infection in the world, and the first in an Australian CF patient.

TITLE:Near-drowning-associated pneumonia with bacteremia caused by coinfection with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Edwardsiella tarda in a healthy white man: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Edwardsiella tarda is an Enterobacteriaceae found in aquatic environments. Extraintestinal infections caused by Edwardsiella tarda in humans are rare and occur in the presence of some risk factors. As far as we know, this is the first case of near-drowning-associated pneumonia with bacteremia caused by coinfection with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Edwardsiella tarda in a healthy patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old previously healthy white man had an episode of fresh water drowning after acute alcohol consumption. Edwardsiella tarda and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were isolated in both tracheal aspirate cultures and blood cultures. 
CONCLUSION: This case shows that Edwardsiella tarda is an important pathogen in near drowning even in healthy individuals, and not only in the presence of risk factors, as previously known.

TITLE:Multidrug-resistant oral Capnocytophaga gingivalis responsible for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Capnocytophaga genus was recently known to highly contribute to the beta-lactam (BL) and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance gene reservoir in the oral microbiota (BL: blaCSP-1 and blaCfxA; MLS: erm(F) and erm(C)). But fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance remains uncommon in literature, without available data on resistance mechanisms. CASE REPORT: For the first time, a case of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was described in a 78-year-old immunocompetent patient due to a multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga gingivalis isolate with significant microbiological finding. C.gingivalis acquired resistance to third generation cephalosporins (blaCfxA3 gene), MLS (erm(F) gene), and fluoroquinolones. Genetics of the resistance, unknown as regards fluoroquinolone, was investigated and a substitution in QRDR of GyrA was described (Gly80Asn substitution) for the first time in the Capnocytophaga genus. LITERATURE REVIEW: A comprehensive literature review of Capnocytophaga spp. extra-oral infection was conducted. Including the present report, on 43 cases, 7 isolates were BL-resistant (17%), 4 isolates were MLS-resistant (9.5%) and 4 isolates were FQ-resistant (9.5%). The studied clinical isolate of C.gingivalis was the only one to combine resistance to the three groups of antibiotics BL, MLS and FQ. Four cases of Capnocytophaga lung infection were reported, including three infections involving C. gingivalis (two FQ resistant) and one involving C. sputigena. 
CONCLUSION: This multidrug-resistant C. gingivalis isolate illustrated the role of oral flora as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance and its contribution to the limitation of effective antibiotics in severe respiratory infections.

TITLE:Multidrug resistance Acinetobacter species at the intensive care unit, Aseer Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia: A one year analysis.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To identify and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) clinical isolates from ICU at Aseer Central Hospital. 
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit, Aseer Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia over 13 months period (2014-2015). Acinetobacter species (n = 105) were isolated from various clinical samples. Isolates were identified using selected phenotypic criteria and confirmed using the Vitek 2 automated system. This system was used to determine the susceptibilities of 21 antimicrobial agents. Patients, isolates and drug data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package to determine some epidemiological and microbiological patterns. 
RESULTS: Of the 105 stains, A. baumannii accounted for 49 (46.67%), A. baumannii complex, 19 (18.09%), A. baumannii/haemolyticus 32 (30.47), Acinetobacter haemolyticus 4 (3.81%), Acinetobater lwoffii 1 (0.95%) and unidentified Acinetobater species 2 (1.3%). Of the 105 Acinetobacter strains, 103 (98.1%) were found multidrug resistant (MDR). A. baumannii strain were 100% sensitive to colistin and 74.5% to trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole. The remaining 19 antimicrobial agents revealed low or no sensitivities: amikacin 16.3%; ampicillin 7.7%; ceftazidime, 7.3%. Distribution of similar sensitivities was shown by other Acinetobacter species. Mean number of isolates from males and females indicates no statistical variation (P = 0.867) whereas age groups showed significant differences (P = 0.008) as it is clear from the high percentage of infected individuals more than 60 years followed by those aged 20-29 years old (19.05%). Upper respiratory tract (30.48%), lower respiratory tract (47.65%) and subcutaneous tissue (9.5%) were the main sources of Acinetobacter spp. but mean numbers of isolates from these specimens indicate no discrepancy between specimens (P = 0.731). 
CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter species including A. baumannii were found MDR (98.1%) according to the current Acinetobacter spp. antimicrobial categorization. Approximately half of these strains were A. baumannii. All Acinetobacter species were 100% sensitive to colistin and to some extent to trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (74.5%). ICU-acquired pneumonia among patients over 60 years of age who spend prolong times at artificial ventilations made up the majority of the cases.

ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoU, a type III secretory toxin and major virulence factor with patatin-like phospholipase activity, is responsible for acute lung injury and sepsis in immunocompromised patients. Through use of a recently updated bacterial genome database, protein sequences predicted to be homologous to Ps. aeruginosa ExoU were identified in 17 other Pseudomonas species (Ps. fluorescens, Ps. lundensis, Ps. weihenstephanensis, Ps. marginalis, Ps. rhodesiae, Ps. synxantha, Ps. libanensis, Ps. extremaustralis, Ps. veronii, Ps. simiae, Ps. trivialis, Ps. tolaasii, Ps. orientalis, Ps. taetrolens, Ps. syringae, Ps. viridiflava, and Ps. cannabina) and 8 Gram-negative bacteria from three other genera (Photorhabdus, Aeromonas, and Paludibacterium). In the alignment of the predicted primary amino acid sequences used for the phylogenetic analyses, both highly conserved and nonconserved parts of the toxin were discovered among the various species. Further comparative studies of the predicted ExoU homologs should provide us with more detailed information about the unique characteristics of the Ps. aeruginosa ExoU toxin.

TITLE:Ralstonia mannitolilytica in cystic fibrosis: A new predictor of worse outcomes.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Patients with Cystic Fibrosis are subject to repeated respiratory tract infections, with recent increasing isolation of unusual pathogens. Ralstonia species have lately been isolated at our institution, an organism historically frequently misidentified as Burkholderia or Pseudomonas. The prevalence of Ralstonia spp. in cystic fibrosis populations has yet to be determined, along with its clinical implications. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Seven patients out of the 301 followed at our cystic fibrosis clinic have had Ralstonia strains identified in their respiratory tract. Most strains identified were multi-drug resistant. After aquisition of Ralstonia spp., the patients' clinical course was characterized by more frequent and more severe respiratory infections along with prolonged hospitalizations, greater decline of lung function, and greater mortality. The mortality rate in this group of patients was 86%. No other factor that could explain such a dramatic evolution was identified upon review of patient data. Some of the strains involved were recognized as clones on Pulse Field Electrophoresis Gel, raising the question of person-to-person transmission. 
CONCLUSION: New pathogens are identified with the evolution of the microbiota in cystic fibrosis respiratory tracts. In our cohort of patients, acquisition of Ralstonia spp. was associated with dramatic outcomes in terms of disease acceleration and raised mortality rates. It is of critical importance to continue to better define the prevalence and clinical impact of Ralstonia in cystic fibrosis populations.

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Ralstonia genus are gram negative bacillus and includes four bacteria namely Ralstonia picketti, Ralstonia Solanacearum, Ralstonia insidiosa and Ralstonia mannitolilytica. These are opportunistic pathogens and cause infections in immunocompromised host. The sources of infection are usually contaminated solutions and water. The majority of the reported cases are caused by R. picketti. It is very rare cause of neonatal sepsis with less than twenty cases reported in literature till date. CASE PRESENTATION: A late preterm male infant, Indian race was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress developing soon after birth. The infant was managed with respiratory support and gradually infant improved and diagnosis of transient tachypnea of newborn was made. At age of 84 h of postnatal life, the infant developed features of neonatal sepsis and investigations were suggestive of sepsis. The infant was started on intravenous antibiotic, multiple vasopressors and steroids. The blood culture showed growth of multi-drug resistant R. picketti. The antibiotics were changed as per sensitivity pattern and infant was discharged in good condition and was accepting breast feeding at the time of discharge. There was also no other case of R. picketti in the nursery during the same time period. 
CONCLUSION: Ralstonia picketti is an uncommon cause of neonatal sepsis and usually source of infection are contaminated solutions and medical products. The management involves early detection, treatment with appropriate antibiotics and doing surveillance culture to identify the possible source of infection.

TITLE:[Accurate diagnosis of Pseudomonas luteola in routine microbiology laboratory: on the occasion of two isolates].
ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas luteola which was previously known as Chryseomonas luteola; is a gram-negative, non-fermentative, aerobic, motile, non-spore-forming bacillus. It is frequently found as a saprophyte in soil, water and other damp environments and is an opportunistic pathogen in patients with underlying medical disorders or with indwelling catheters. It has been reported as an uncommon cause of bacteremia, sepsis, septic arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, and peritonitis. Thus, early and accurate identification of this rare species is important for the treatment and also to provide information about the epidemiology of P.luteola infections. This report was aimed to draw attention to the accurate identification of P.luteola in clinical samples, upon the isolation and identification in two cases in the medical microbiology laboratory of a university hospital. In February 2011, a 66-year-old man, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia, was admitted to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea. A chest tube was inserted on the 20th day of admission by the reason of recurrent pleural effusion. Staphylococcus aureus and a non-fermentative gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) with wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies were isolated from the pleural fluid sample obtained on the 9th day following the insertion of the chest tube. In February 2012, a 7-year-old male cystic fibrosis patient who had no signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary exacerbation was admitted to the hospital for a routine control. This patient had chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.aureus and his sputum sample obtained at this visit revealed isolation of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus, Aspergillus fumigatus and a wrinkled, sticky yellow NFGNB. Both of these NFGNB were identified as P.luteola by the Phoenix automated microbial identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA). To evaluate the microbiological characteristics of these two isolates, the strains were further analysed by VITEK MS (bioMerieux, France) and Microflex LT mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Both of the MALDI-TOF-MS systems identified the isolates as P.luteola and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (ABI PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems, USA) also confirmed the identification. The strains had wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies which were oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and non-fermentative. The Gram stained smears of the colonies revealed clusters of gram-negative bacilli probably embedded into a biofilm matrix. Since there are no accepted standards for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of P.luteola strains, the standards determined by CLSI for ""other non-Enterobacteriaceae"" (non-fermentative bacteria excluding P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Burkholderia cepacia, B.mallei, B.pseudomallei and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were used for the susceptibility testing. Gradient MIC method (E-Test, bioMerieux, France) revealed that the isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, colistin and levofloxacin. Accurate and prompt identification of P.luteola which is identified as a rare pathogen in serious cases is of critical importance since it has been suggested that this organism is likely to become more frequent as a nosocomial pathogen since the interventional processes increase in current medical practice. This report supported that Phoenix automated phenotypic identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA) and the two MALDI-TOF-MS based systems (VITEK MS and Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer) were successfull in the accurate identification of P.luteola.

题目:【常规微生物实验室黄体假单胞菌的准确诊断:以两株分离株为例】。
摘要:luteola假单胞菌(Pseudomonas luteola)原名为Chryseomonas luteola;是一种革兰氏阴性，非发酵，需氧，运动，不形成芽孢杆菌。它经常在土壤、水和其他潮湿环境中发现腐生菌，是潜在医疗疾病患者或留置导尿管患者的机会性病原体。据报道，它是引起菌血症、脓毒症、脓毒症关节炎、脑膜炎、心内膜炎和腹膜炎的罕见原因。因此，对这一稀有物种的早期准确鉴定对于治疗和提供关于木犀草杆菌感染的流行病学信息是很重要的。本报告的目的是在一所大学医院医学微生物实验室分离和鉴定两例病例的基础上，提请注意在临床样本中对木犀草杆菌的准确鉴定。2011年2月，因进行性呼吸困难入院，患者为66岁男性，慢性阻塞性肺疾病、冠状动脉疾病、再生障碍性贫血。因复发胸腔积液于入院第20天插入胸管。从插入胸管后第9天获得的胸液样本中分离出金黄色葡萄球菌和一种具有皱褶、粘性黄色菌落的非发酵革兰氏阴性杆菌(NFGNB)。2012年2月，收治一名7岁男性囊性纤维化患者，无急性肺加重的体征和症状，作为常规对照。该患者慢性定殖为铜绿假单胞菌和金黄色葡萄球菌，这次访问获得的痰标本显示分离出铜绿假单胞菌、金黄色葡萄球菌、烟曲霉和皱褶的、粘稠的黄色NFGNB。这两种NFGNB都被鉴定为luteola凤凰自动化微生物鉴定系统(BD诊断，美国)。为了评估这两株分离株的微生物学特征，采用VITEK MS(法国bioMerieux)和Microflex LT质谱仪(德国Bruker Daltonics)对菌株进行进一步分析。MALDI-TOF-MS和16S rRNA基因测序(ABI PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems, USA)也证实了鉴定结果。菌落呈皱状、粘稠黄色，呈氧化酶阴性、过氧化氢酶阳性、不发酵。革兰氏染色菌落涂片显示革兰氏阴性杆菌可能嵌在生物膜基质中。因为没有公认的标准测试P.luteola菌株的抗生素敏感性,CLSI标准确定的“其他non-Enterobacteriaceae”(non-fermentative细菌P.aeruginosa除外,不动杆菌spp。伯克不过B.mallei, B.pseudomallei和Stenotrophomonas maltophilia)被用于敏感性测试。梯度MIC法(E-Test, bioMerieux，法国)显示分离株对庆大霉素、哌拉西林-他唑巴坦、头孢他啶、头孢吡肟、美罗培南、粘菌素和左氧氟沙星敏感。准确和迅速的鉴定黄木霉，这是一种罕见的病原体在严重的情况下是至关重要的，因为它已经被建议，这一有机体可能成为更频繁的医院病原体，因为干预过程在当前的医疗实践增加。本报告证实了Phoenix自动表型鉴定系统(BD Diagnostics, USA)和两种基于MALDI-TOF-MS的系统(VITEK MS和Bruker Microflex LT质谱联用仪)可以成功地对木黄草进行准确鉴定。"

TITLE:First time identification of Pandoraea sputorum from a patient with cystic fibrosis in Argentina: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pandoraea species are considered emerging pathogens in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) and are difficult to identify by conventional biochemical methods. These multidrug resistant bacteria remain poorly understood particularly in terms of natural resistance, mechanisms of acquired resistance and impact on the prognosis of the disease and the lung function. Among them, Pandoraea sputorum has been previously described in few cases of CF patients from Spain, Australia, France and United States, underlining the need of more clinical data for a better knowledge of its pathogenicity. This is the first report relating to P. sputorum in a CF patient in Argentina. CASE PRESENTATION: Pandoraea sputorum was identified in a nine-year-old cystic fibrosis patient from Argentina, after treatment failure during an exacerbation. The isolates were successfully identified by combining molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) methods, after reassessing previous misidentified isolates by conventional methods. After first isolation of P. sputorum, patient's clinical condition worsened but later improved after a change in the treatment. Although isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem, in our case, the antibiotic treatment failed in the eradication of P. sputorum. 
CONCLUSIONS: All combined data showed a chronic colonization with P. sputorum associated to a deterioration of lung function. We noted that the presence of P. sputorum can be underestimated in CF patients and MALDI-TOF MS appears to be a promising means of accurate identification of Pandoraea species.

标题:首次从阿根廷囊性纤维化患者中鉴定出痰腺菌:一个病例报告。
文摘:
背景:Pandoraea物种被认为是囊性纤维化(CF)背景下的新兴病原体，很难用常规生化方法识别。对这些耐多药细菌的了解仍然很少，特别是在自然耐药、获得性耐药机制以及对疾病预后和肺功能的影响方面。在这些病例中，先前在西班牙、澳大利亚、法国和美国的CF患者中发现过痰腺潘多拉菌，这表明需要更多的临床数据来更好地了解其致病性。这是阿根廷首例关于脓杆菌感染的报告。病例报告:在阿根廷9岁囊性纤维化患者在病情加重期间治疗失败后发现了痰泛菌。基于16S rRNA测序的分子技术和质谱(MS)方法相结合成功鉴定了这两株分离菌株。首次隔离P. sputorum后，患者的临床状况恶化，但后来改变治疗后改善。虽然分离株对甲氧苄啶-磺胺甲恶唑和亚胺培南敏感，但在本病例中，抗生素治疗未能根除痰链球菌。
结论:所有综合数据显示慢性痰链球菌定植与肺功能恶化相关。我们注意到在CF患者中P. sputorum的存在可能被低估，MALDI-TOF MS似乎是一种有希望的方法来准确鉴定Pandoraea物种。"

TITLE:First report of cavitary pneumonia due to community-acquired Acinetobacter pittii, study of virulence and overview of pathogenesis and treatment.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter pittii is a nosocomial pathogen rarely involved in community-acquired infections. We report for the first time that A. pittii can be responsible for cavitary community-acquired pneumonia and study its virulence, and discuss its pathogenesis and treatment options. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old woman with a history of smoking and systemic lupus was admitted to Nimes University Hospital (France) with coughing and sputum lasting for three weeks. Thoracic CT scanner showed cavitary pneumonia. Broncho-alveolar lavage cultures found community-acquired Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. The clinical outcome was favourable after twenty-one days of antimicrobial treatment by piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin then cefepime. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses identified an A. pittii ST249. Despite the atypical clinical presentation with an unexpected partial destruction of lung parenchyma, we found very low virulence potential of the A. pittii strain with nematode killing assays and biofilm formation test. The median time required to kill 50% of the nematodes was 7 +- 0.3 days for A. pittii ST249, 7 +- 0.2 days for A. baumanii NAB ST2 and 8 +- 0.2 days for E. coli OP50, (p &gt; 0,05). A. pittii ST249 showed significantly slower biofilm formation than A. baumanii NAB ST2: BFI = 8.83 +- 0.59 vs 3.93 +- 0.27 at 2 h (p &lt; 0.0001), BFI = 6.3 +- 0.17 vs 1.87 +- 0.12 at 3 h (p &lt; 0.0001) and BFI = 3.67 +- 0.41 vs 1.7 +- 0.06 after 4 h of incubation (p &lt; 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired A. pittii should be considered as possible cause of sub-acute cavitary pneumonia particularly in a smoking and/or immunocompromised patient despite its low virulence potential.

TITLE:Clinical characteristics of bacteraemia caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates in a medical centre in Taiwan.
ABSTRACT:This study investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of bacteraemia due to Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) species among 54 patients without cystic fibrosis from January 2013 to February 2015. BCC isolates were identified to the species level by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system and by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Sequencing of the recA gene in the 54 blood isolates revealed 37 (68.5%) isolates of B. cenocepacia, 9 (16.7%) of B. cepacia, 4 (7.4%) of B. multivorans and one isolate each of B. arboris, B. pseudomultivorans, B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis. The overall performance of the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system for correctly identifying the 54 BCC isolates to the species level was 79.6%, which was better than that (16.7%) by 16S RNA sequencing analysis. Bacteraemic pneumonia (n = 23, 42.6%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (n = 21, 38.9%) were the most common types of infection. Higher rates of ceftazidime and meropenem resistance were found in B. cepacia isolates (33.3% and 22.2%, respectively) than in isolates of B. cenocepacia (21.6% and 10.8%, respectively) and other species (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively). Overall, the 30-day mortality rate was 38.9% (21/54). Bacteraemia caused by BCC species other than B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 20.005, P = 0.024) and high SOFA score (aOR 1.412, P = 0.003) were predictive of higher 30-day mortality. Different BCC species are associated with different outcomes of bacteraemia and exhibit different susceptibility patterns.

TITLE:Exacerbation of bronchiectasis by Pseudomonas monteilii: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas spp are important opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens. One such species is Pseudomonas monteilii (P. monteilii). It has been described as an environmental contaminant and potential pathogen. We identified this organism as the causative agent of an exacerbation of bronchiectasis and an environmental contaminant in our hospital on two separate occasions. CASE PRESENTATION: P. monteilii was the cause of an exacerbation of bronchiectasis in a 30-year-old HIV negative male. Patient presented with cough with sputum production and exertional dyspnea. The isolate was recovered from a sputum sample in significant counts and definitively identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation- Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). He was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and recovered clinically and microbiologically. Another two isolates of the organism were contaminants from the hospital environment. The three isolates were susceptible to all tested antibiotics. Typing by Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) found no clonal relationship between them. 
CONCLUSIONS: Less common species of Pseudomonas need to be identified accurately. This organism is identified by commonly used phenotypic systems as P. putida which may have contributed to a lower reported prevalence. P. monteilii is a known environmental contaminant and must also be considered as a potential pathogen, particularly in patients with chronic lung disease.

结论:应准确鉴定较少见的假单胞菌。这种微生物被常用的表型系统鉴定为P. putida，这可能有助于较低的报告患病率。蒙氏疟原虫是一种已知的环境污染物，也必须被认为是一种潜在的病原体，特别是在慢性肺部疾病患者中。"

TITLE:Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Pantoea agglomerans infection in children.
ABSTRACT:Pantoea agglomerans is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium that rarely is responsible for the infections in humans but it is often a causative factor of a number of occupational diseases. This study evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics and pathogenicity of P. agglomerans in children. We retrospectively reviewed microbiological test results for all children (1 month old to 18 years old) who were admitted to our pediatric hospital between January 2000 to June 2015 and had positive clinical specimen cultures for P. agglomerans. Isolates were identified using conventional tests and the BBL Crystal E/NF ID or MALDI-TOF MS systems. Antibiotic susceptibilities were evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. We identified fifteen positive cultures from 14 patients with confirmed infections. The positive specimens included pus, urine, tracheal aspirate, blood, and central venous line samples that yielded P. agglomerans. The median patient age was 8.8 years (range: 1.5 months to 16.5 years), and all patients had underlying comorbidities. Five patients had medical devices, and two devices were removed. The most common P. agglomerans infections involved wound infections (35.7%), pneumonia (21.4%), and urinary tract infections (21.4%). Three patients had concomitant infections (Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus). Five patients had anemia. Three patients (21.4%) died, and all three had carbapenem-resistant P. agglomerans that was detected after the first week of hospitalization; two cases involved pneumonia, which was ineffectively treated. P. agglomerans infections may be life-threatening, especially in young patients with pneumonia. Hospital-acquired P. agglomerans may have different pathogenicity and clinical features, compared to community-acquired P. agglomerans, although further studies are needed to understand the drug-resistance patterns in this bacterium.

摘要:泛团菌是一种环境革兰氏阴性细菌，很少引起人类感染，但常是多种职业病的致病因素。本研究评估了儿童结块泛菌的临床、微生物学特征和致病性。我们回顾性回顾了2000年1月至2015年6月在我院儿科医院住院的所有临床标本培养泛凝血弧菌阳性的儿童(1个月至18岁)的微生物学检测结果。采用常规方法和BBL Crystal E/NF ID或MALDI-TOF MS系统对分离菌株进行鉴定。采用Kirby-Bauer纸片扩散法评估抗生素敏感性。我们从14名确诊感染的患者中鉴定出15种阳性培养物。阳性标本包括脓液、尿液、气管吸出物、血液和中心静脉线样本，产生结块泛菌。中位患者年龄为8.8岁(范围:1.5个月到16.5岁)，所有患者都有潜在的共病。5名患者携带了医疗设备，其中2个设备被移除。最常见的结块脓杆菌感染包括伤口感染(35.7%)、肺炎(21.4%)和尿路感染(21.4%)。3例合并感染(粪肠球菌、铜绿假单胞菌、烟曲霉)。5例患者有贫血。3例患者(21.4%)死亡，3例患者均在住院第一周后检测出耐碳青霉烯类凝聚菌;两例为肺炎，治疗无效。结块弧菌感染可能危及生命，尤其是在年轻的肺炎患者中。与社区获得的结块拟单胞菌相比，医院获得的结块拟单胞菌可能具有不同的致病性和临床特征，但需要进一步研究来了解该细菌的耐药模式。"

ABSTRACT:A 46-year-old man was admitted to ICU with a diagnosis at the time of admission of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) and sepsis due to suspected Ventilator-Associated Pneumoniae (VAP). Specimens for the following laboratory workup were inquired, i.e. complete blood count, culture and resistance workup using specimens obtained from the tip of suction pipe, urinalysis and urine culture, blood culture and resistance, procalcitonin and lactate levels. Neutrophilia was found along with increased procalcitonin and lactate levels, which supported the sepsis diagnosis. Moreover, the result of culture from suction pipe demonstrated colonies of Pseudomonas luteola MDRO, which might be originated from the oropharyngeal colonization of the patients due to poor oral hygiene and ineffective oral hygiene nursing; therefore, the colonies of the microorganism were swabbed away when obtaining the specimens. Ineffective oral hygiene nursing may have a potency to cause VAP and recurrent VAP.

TITLE:Ralstonia infection in cystic fibrosis.
ABSTRACT:This study aimed to determine prevalence of Ralstonia spp. in cystic fibrosis patients, look for any evidence of cross infection and to describe clinical outcomes for patients infected by Ralstonia spp. Prevalence of Ralstonia spp. was calculated annually from 2008 to 2016. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed on &gt;=1 sample from patients with an isolation of Ralstonia spp. between 2008 and 2016. A prospective, longitudinal observational study of adult patients was performed with 12 months follow-up from recruitment. Prevalence of Ralstonia spp. rose from 0 6% in 2008 to 2 4% in 2016. In total 12 out of 14 (86%) patients with &gt;=1 isolation of Ralstonia spp. developed chronic infection. A pair and a group of three unrelated patients with epidemiological connections shared strains of Ralstonia mannitolilytica. Lung function of Ralstonia spp. infected patients was moderately to severely impaired. Prevalence of Ralstonia spp. is low but increasing. The risk of a patient developing chronic Ralstonia spp. infection following first acquisition is high and cross-infection may be possible. Whether Ralstonia spp. infection causes increased pulmonary exacerbation frequency and lung function decline needs to be evaluated in larger prospective studies.

TITLE:Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis in a methotrexate-treated patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
ABSTRACT:Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative rod that can be transmitted primarily by dog bites. This life-threatening organism commonly causes sepsis in patients with splenectomy or alcoholism. A 53-year-old rheumatoid arthritis male treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years was admitted for a 4-day history of fever and dyspnea. He had been bitten on a finger by the family dog 4 days before onset. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and he subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, blood cultures grew gram-negative bacilli and despite intensive treatment, he died 5 days after admission. Later, C. canimorsus was identified from his culture samples using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction. C. canimorsus infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis for immunocompromised hosts following animal bites.

TITLE:Sphingobacterium spiritivorum bacteremia due to cellulitis in an elderly man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Sphingobacterium spiritivorum is a glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rod, formerly classified as one of the Flavobacterium species. It is characterized by a large number of cellular membrane sphingophospholipids. Sphingobacterium species are ubiquitous and isolated from natural environments, such as soil and water. However, they rarely cause infections in humans. Only a limited number of cases have been reported in elderly and immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases and predisposing factors. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Japanese man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure visited the Kariya Toyota General Hospital, Aichi, Japan with the chief complaint of fever accompanied by chills and left leg pain. At initial presentation, he was distressed and dyspneic. He was febrile (38.8  C), and his left foot was swollen with reddening and tenderness. We diagnosed him as having cellulitis, and he was hospitalized for antibiotic therapy. Initially, he was treated with intravenously administered cefazolin, but after the isolation of a glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rod from blood cultures, we decided to switch cefazolin to intravenously administered meropenem on day 4, considering the antibiotic resistance of the causative organism. The causative organism was identified as S. spiritivorum on day 6. His condition gradually stabilized after admission. Meropenem was switched to orally administered levofloxacin on day 12. He was discharged on day 16 and treated successfully without any complications. 
CONCLUSIONS: Although S. spiritivorum is rare, with limited cases isolated from cellulitis, it should be considered as a causative organism in elderly and immunocompromised patients with cellulitis. Blood cultures are the key to correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

文摘:
背景:Sphingobacterium spiritivorum是一种葡萄糖非发酵革兰氏阴性杆菌，以前被列为黄杆菌属之一。其特征是含有大量鞘磷脂的细胞膜。Sphingobacterium是普遍存在的，与自然环境隔离，如土壤和水。然而，它们很少引起人类感染。据报道，只有少数病例发生在患有基础疾病和易感因素的老年和免疫功能低下患者。病例表现:80岁日本男性，慢性阻塞性肺疾病伴充血性心力衰竭，主诉发热伴寒颤，左腿疼痛，到日本爱知县卡里亚丰田总医院就诊。初诊时，他感到痛苦和呼吸困难。患者发热(38.8℃)，左脚红肿压痛。我们诊断他患有蜂窝织炎，他住院接受抗生素治疗。最初给予静脉注射头孢唑林，但从血液培养物中分离出葡萄糖非发酵革兰氏阴性棒后，考虑到病原菌的耐药性，我们决定在第4天将头孢唑林改为静脉注射美罗培南。病原菌于第6天鉴定为精神梭菌。入院后病情逐渐稳定。美罗培南在第12天改为口服左氧氟沙星。患者于第16天出院，治疗成功，无任何并发症。
结论:虽然梭菌是罕见的，只有少数病例从蜂窝织炎中分离出来，但它应该被认为是老年和免疫功能低下的蜂窝织炎患者的病原。血培养是正确诊断和适当治疗的关键。"

TITLE:Comparative analysis of clinics, pathologies and immune responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice infected with Streptobacillus moniliformis.
ABSTRACT:Streptobacillus (S.) moniliformis is a rat-associated zoonotic pathogen that occasionally causes disease in other species. We investigated the working hypothesis that intranasal infection might lead to different immune responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice associated with distinct pathologies. This study confirmed with 75% mortality the known high susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice to Streptobacillus moniliformis infection in comparison to BALB/c mice which did not develop signs of disease. Main pathologies in C57BL/6 mice were purulent to necrotizing lymphadenitis and pneumonia. Significant seroconversion was recorded in surviving mice of both strains. Differentiation of IgG-subclasses revealed mean ratios of IgG2b to IgG1 below 0.5 in sera of all mice prior to infection and of BALB/c mice post infection. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice had a mean IgG2b/IgG1 ratio of 2.5 post infection indicating a Th1 immune response in C57BL/6 versus a Th2 response in BALB/c mice. Evaluation of different sentinel systems revealed that cultural and serological investigations of these animals might not be sufficient to detect infection. In summary, an intranasal S. moniliformis infection model in C57BL/6 mice leading to purulent to necrotizing inflammations in the lung, the lymph nodes and other organs associated with a Th1 immune response is described.

摘要/ ABSTRACT摘要:串珠链杆菌(S.)是一种与鼠相关的人畜共患病原体，偶尔在其他物种中引起疾病。我们研究了一种有效的假说，即鼻内感染可能导致与不同病理相关的C57BL/6和BALB/c小鼠不同的免疫应答。本研究证实，与BALB/c小鼠相比，C57BL/6小鼠对串珠芽孢杆菌感染的已知高敏感性小鼠的死亡率为75%，而BALB/c小鼠没有出现疾病症状。C57BL/6小鼠主要病理为化脓性至坏死性淋巴结炎和肺炎。在两种毒株幸存的小鼠中均记录了显著的血清转换。分化的igg亚型显示，感染前和感染后BALB/c小鼠血清中IgG2b和IgG1的平均比值均在0.5以下。相比之下，C57BL/6小鼠感染后的平均IgG2b/IgG1比值为2.5，表明C57BL/6小鼠的Th1免疫应答相对于BALB/c小鼠的Th2免疫应答。对不同哨点系统的评估显示，这些动物的培养和血清学调查可能不足以发现感染。总之，C57BL/6小鼠的串珠链球菌鼻内感染模型导致与Th1免疫应答相关的肺、淋巴结和其他器官化脓性至坏死性炎症。"

TITLE:Strongyloides Hyperinfection Syndrome causing fatal meningitis and septicemia by Citrobacter koseri.
ABSTRACT:Citrobacter koseri is a gram-negative bacillius that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is an uncommon pathogen that typically causes meningitis and brain abscesses in children, however central nervous system (CNS) infections are rarely found in adults. We present a case of C. koseri meningitis in an immunocompetent adult secondary to intestinal micro-perforation caused by Strongyloides A 76-year-old man admitted for asthma exacerbation developed septic shock. A lumbar puncture revealed bacterial meningitis. Blood and CSF cultures grew Citrobacter koseri with identical susceptibilities, suggesting infection by one strain. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient expired of multi-organ failure. Autopsy identified diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as the immedi ate cause of death with a heavy burden of Strongyloides stercoralis in his gastrointestinal system, lungs, and meninges. Citrobacter koseri is a gram-negative bacillus of the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is an uncommon pathogen that typically causes meningitis and brain abscesses in children. Infections in adults occur in immunocompromised hosts or instances where an insult creates a port of entry. This is the first documented case of C.koseri sepsis in an immunocompetent host associated with Strongyloides Hyperinfection Syndrome (SHS), where massive parasitic intestinal invasion reaches pulmonary circulation and perforates the alveolar membrane. This case highlights that presence of rare enterobacterial infections should prompt consideration of differentials including SHS.

TITLE:Legionella indianapolisensis sp. nov., isolated from a patient with pulmonary abscess.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: To date, at least 50 species of Legionella have been described. These organisms are ubiquitous in nature and have been isolated from diverse ecological environments, including man-made structures such as cooling towers and spas. Legionellae have also been isolated from human and veterinary clinical specimens, and their roles in disease are well-established. This report describes the isolation of a novel Legionella species from a respiratory specimen from a patient with influenza and suspected pulmonary embolus. CASE: A 68-year-old male presented to an Indianapolis-area hospital with pulmonary disease; upon workup, he was found to have influenza A. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also submitted for conventional bacterial culture and Legionella culture. The patient was prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic and recovered. 
RESULTS: A Legionella-like bacterium was isolated on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, and mass spectrometry and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing inconclusively identified the isolate as a Legionella sp. Further analysis of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the strain to be a new species, related to Legionella hackeliae. Physiochemical and morphological testing were used to confirm the discovery of a novel species, Legionella indianapolisensis sp. nov., type strain SMNF-IS.

TITLE:On Burkholderiales order microorganisms and cystic fibrosis in Russia.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Microbes infecting cystic fibrosis patients' respiratory tract are important in determining patients' functional status. Representatives of Burkholderiales order are the most dangerous. The goal of our investigation was to reveal the diversity of Burkholderiales, define of their proportion in the microbiome of various parts of respiratory tract and determine the pathogenicity of the main representatives. 
RESULTS: In more than 500 cystic fibrosis patients, representing all Federal Regions of Russia, 34.0% were infected by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), 21.0% by Achromobacter spp. and 12.0% by Lautropia mirabilis. B. cenocepacia was the most numerous species among the Bcc (93.0%), and A. ruhlandii was the most numerous among Achromobacter spp. (58.0%). The most abundant genotype in Bcc was sequence type (ST) 709, and in Achromobacter spp. it was ST36. These STs constitute Russian epidemic strains. Whole genome sequencing of strains A. ruhlandii SCCH3:Ach33-1365 ST36 and B. cenocepacia GIMC4560:Bcn122 ST709 revealed huge resistomes and many virulence factors, which may explain the difficulties in eradicating these strains. An experience of less dangerous B. cenocepcia ST710 elimination was described. Massively parallel sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons, including V1-V4 hypervariable regions, was used to definite ""healthy"" microbiome characteristics. Analysis of maxillary sinus lavage of 7 patients revealed infection with Proteobacteria of the same ST as pathogens from sputum, suggesting that the maxillary sinus is a source of infection in cystic fibrosis patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of the Russian epidemic bacterial strains in the sputum and sinuses of cystic fibrosis patients have better defined the importance of Burkholderiales bacteria. This information may aid in the development of effective approaches for treatment of this disease.

ABSTRACT:Lung abscess following flexible bronchoscopy is a rare and sometimes fatal iatrogenic complication. Here, we report the first case of a lung abscess caused by multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga sputigena following bronchoscopy. A 67-year-old man underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate a lung mass. Seven days after transbronchial lung biopsy, he presented with an abscess formation in a lung mass. Empirical antibiotic therapy, including with garenoxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and cefepime, was ineffective. Percutaneous needle aspiration of lung abscess yielded C. sputigena resistant to multiple antibiotics but remained susceptible to carbapenem. He was successfully treated by the combination therapy with surgery and with approximately 6 weeks of intravenous carbapenem. Finally he was diagnosed with a lung abscess with adenocarcinoma expressing high levels of programmed cell death ligand 1. The emergence of multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga species is a serious concern for effective antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians should consider multidrug-resistant C. sputigena as a causative pathogen of lung abscess when it is refractory to antimicrobial treatment.

TITLE:A Fatal Case of Community Acquired Cupriavidus Pauculus Pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Introduction: Cupriavidus pauculus is a rarely isolated non-fermentative, aerobic bacillus, which occasionally causes severe human infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Strains have been isolated from various clinical and environmental sources. Case presentation: A 67-year-old man was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory failure. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, pulmonary sepsis and underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Examination revealed diminished bilateral vesicular breath sounds, fever, intense yellow tracheal secretions, a respiratory rate of 24/minute, a heart rate of 123/minute, and blood pressure of 75/55 mmHg. Vasoactive treatment was initiated. Investigations revealed elevated lactate and C-reactive protein levels. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration. Parenteral ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were administered. Tracheal aspirate culture and blood culture showed bacterial growth of Cupriavidus pauculus. Colistin was added to the treatment. There was a poor clinical response despite repeated blood culture showing negative results. The diagnosis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by C. pauculus was made. The patient died eleven days after admission. Conclusions: Clinical improvement cannot always be expected in spite of targeted antibiotic therapy. This pathogen should be considered responsible for infections that usually develop in immunocompromised patients.

TITLE:Rare Shewanella spp. associated with pulmonary and bloodstream infections of cancer patients, China: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Members of Shewanella species are opportunistic pathogens that are found in marine environments. Currently more than sixty species have been identified, whereas the most commonly clinical cases associated with Shewanella species have involved only two species, i.e., S. algae and S. putrefaciens. We present two cases of pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by two rare Shewanella spp. strains from patients of gastrointestinal cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: Two male patients with a history of gastrointestinal cancer presented to hospital with pulmonary and bloodstream infections, respectively. The infective pathogens of both cases were primarily isolated and identified as Shewanella algae (case I) and Shewanella putrefaciens (case II) by phenotypic features and VITEK 2 system, but they were further confirmed as Shewanella haliotis and Shewanella upenei by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The major bacterial composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage in case I was also identified as Shewanella by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the two strains had broad susceptibility, but S. haliotis in the case I was resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and S. upenei in the case II was intermediate to imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. 
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cases of the pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by Shewanella spp. from clinical patients in mainland China. Shewanella as a potential pathogen in China should not be ignored.

TITLE:Leclercia adecarboxylata: a case report and literature review of 74 cases demonstrating its pathogenicity in immunocompromised patients.
ABSTRACT:Leclercia adecarboxylata is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It has been described as an emerging human pathogen with the potential to cause severe infection in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to describe a clinical case of infection with L. adecarboxylata and give a review of previous reports on infection. We report the presence of L. adecarboxylata in a patient initially admitted to our hospital for a lung transplant. She had diarrhoea, urinary tract infection and pneumonia caused by L. adecarboxylata. The isolate was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to 15 other antibiotics tested. The literature search for previous reports of infection with L. adecarboxylata resulted in 61 publications describing 74 cases. Bacteremia and wound infections were most often described, and only a few cases were fatal. L. adecarboxylata was most often found as a monomicrobial infection in immunocompromised patients, and as part of a polymicrobial infection in immunocompetent patients. The previously described isolates showed a high susceptibility to antibiotics, and treatment was efficient in most cases. Due to similarities in metabolic products, L. adecarboxylata might have been mistaken as Escherichia spp., but with new identification methods such as MALDI-TOF MS, it is possible to obtain a certain identification.

TITLE:Delftia acidovorans: A rare cause of septic pulmonary embolism from catheter-related infection: Case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:Septic pulmonary emboli is a rare condition due to the dislodgement of an infected thrombus traveling to the pulmonary vasculature via the venous system. Staphylococcus spp. and Candida spp. are the most common causative agents. The most common risk factor is intravenous drug abuse, but there has been an association with intravenous catheters. Delftia acidovorans (DA) is a rare organism causing catheter-related infection, which has a tendency to embolize and clog up major vessels. It is highly resistant to all available aminoglycoside agents. There are only a few cases reported in children showing DA as a cause of septic emboli with none of the cases reported in a young patient. We report a similar case but in a young adult who developed septic emboli due to DA that was caused by an infected peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Since the organism is highly susceptible to recurrent embolization, the PICC line was removed and the patient was treated successfully with an appropriate antibiotic regime.

TITLE:What is the role of Ewingella americana in humans? A case report in a healthy 4-year-old girl.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Ewingella americana (Ea) is a Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting, oxidase-negative and catalase-positive bacterium that was first described in 1983 as a new genus and species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is not known whether Ea is a true pathogen or simply an opportunistic infectious agent, as most of the cases have been described in patients at risk. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old girl described here was hospitalized due to a productive cough over the previous 3 weeks and a fever &gt; 38  C associated with tachypnea over the previous 2 days. Her familial and personal medical histories were negative for relevant diseases, including respiratory infections. At admission, she was febrile (axillary temperature 39.2  C) and had dyspnea with retractions, grunting and nasal flaring. A chest examination revealed fine crackling rales in the left upper field associated with bilateral wheezing. A chest X-ray revealed segmental consolidation of the lingula of the left lung. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (15.,800 white blood cells/mm3 with 50.3% neutrophils), a slight increase in serum C-reactive protein (11.9 mg/L) and normal procalcitonin values (&lt; 0.12 ng/mL). A nasopharyngeal swab culture did not reveal viral or bacterial respiratory pathogens, including atypical bacteria. A blood culture revealed the presence of a Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod that was oxidase negative and catalase positive. The isolate was identified by means of the VITEK 2 identification system (bioMerieux, Firenze, Italy) as Ea. This identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16 s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). The pathogen was sensitive to aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime but was intermediate against sulfametoxazole/trimethoprim and resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, fosfomycin, and oxacillin. The child was immediately treated orally with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and erythromycin. Based on the results of a blood culture and sensitivity tests, the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid medication was stopped after 3 days. Erythromycin was continued for a total of 10 days, and the child was discharged after 3 days in the hospital. Follow-up visit 1 month later did not reveal any respiratory problems. 
CONCLUSION: This case shows that Ea infections in healthy subjects are mild even in pediatric age, and the need for antibiotic therapy is debated. Cases occurring in subjects with underlying chronic disease can be significantly more complicated and require appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TITLE:Clinical and molecular characteristics of Klebsiella pneumoniae causing bloodstream infections in Japan: occurrence of hypervirulent infections in healthcare.
ABSTRACT:Although hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) have been associated with severe community-acquired infections that occur among relatively healthy individuals, information about hvKp infections in healthcare settings remains limited. Here we systematically analyzed the clinical and molecular characteristics of K. pneumoniae isolates causing bloodstream infections in a cross-sectional study. Clinical characteristics of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections from hospitals across Japan were analyzed by review of medical records. Whole-genome sequencing of the causative isolates was performed. Bacterial species were confirmed and hvKp were identified using whole-genome sequencing data. Clinical characteristics of hvKp infections were compared with non-hvKp infections by bivariable analyses. Of 140 cases of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections, 26 cases (18.6%) were caused by various clones of hvKp defined by the carriage of cardinal virulence genes. Molecular identification revealed that 24 (17.1%) and 14 cases (10%) were caused by Klebsiella variicola and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, respectively. Patients with hvKp infections had higher proportions of diabetes mellitus (Risk ratio [RR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.94), and their infection had significantly higher propensity to involve pneumonia (RR, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.39-24.6), liver abscess (RR, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.39-24.6), and disseminated infections (RR, 6.58; 95% CI, 1.16-37.4) compared with those infected by other isolates. More than half of hvKp infections were healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired, and a probable event of healthcare-associated transmission of hvKp was documented. hvKp isolates, which are significantly associated with severe and disseminated infections, are frequently involved in healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired infections in Japan.

TITLE:Leclercia adecarboxylata Cholecystitis with Septic Shock in Immunocompetent Patient.
ABSTRACT:L. adecarboxylata is a Gram-negative rod previously named Escherichia adecarboxylata, isolated as normal flora in the gut of animals including human stool. Most reported cases refer to immunocompromised patients with polymicrobial infections and water environments. Here we present a case of 51-year-old immunocompetent female presented with nausea, vomiting, malaise, and subjective fever for few days. On examination, she was drowsy but arousable and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Her abdomen was tender globally and more tender in the epigastric area. Vitals showed a temperature of 37 C, pulse of 110 beats/min, blood pressure of 75/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. An HIV panel and hepatitis panel were negative. Liver and gallbladder ultrasound was performed, revealing multiple nonmobile stones with shadowing noted within the gallbladder sac, a thickened gallbladder wall, and a moderate amount of pericholecystic fluid. Broad spectrum antibiotics, crystalloid fluids, and vasopressors were initiated. A few hours after admission she developed respiratory failure for which she underwent endotracheal intubation. An ultrasound guided gallbladder drain was performed. Culture of the biliary fluid yielded pure growth of pan-sensitive L. adecarboxylata; antibiotics were narrowed accordingly. The patient was on the maximum doses of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine with a blood pressure of 75/45 and a mean arterial pressure of 51. She passed away on the fourth day of admission.

TITLE:Ralstonia pickettii Bacteremia: An Emerging Infection in a Tertiary Care Hospital Setting.
ABSTRACT:Ralstonia species are Gram-negative bacilli that have increasingly been recognized as emerging nosocomial pathogens, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Ralstonia pickettii is the most clinically important pathogen from the Ralstonia genus. Nosocomial outbreaks of Ralstonia pickettii infections brought about by the use of contaminated medical solutions, including saline, sterile water, as well as disinfectants, have been reported. There have been case reports of invasive infections with variable presentations. Here, we describe three cases of Ralstonia pickettii bacteremia during a period of one year in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. The first case was a 76-year-old male, known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who presented with complaints of burning micturition, hematuria, and fever. The patient had a history of multiple hospital admissions in the recent past. His blood culture was found to be positive for Ralstonia pickettii. A computed tomography scan of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (CT KUB) was suggestive of pyelonephritis. The patient improved on intravenous meropenem. The second case was a 47-year-old man, who was admitted with a gunshot injury to the neck, resulting in complete cervical cord resection and mild hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient had a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, which was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia with Acinetobacter and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) with Ralstonia pickettii. He was treated with meropenem and colistin but continued to deteriorate and expired. The third case was a 46-year-old lady, known case of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who was admitted with prosthetic valve endocarditis. She had a prolonged hospital stay complicated by CLABSI with Ralstonia pickettii, improved on meropenem, but later died due to fungemia. Ralstonia pickettii is an emerging cause of nosocomial infection in patients, particularly those with a prolonged hospital stay, and can cause invasive and severe infections.

标题:皮凯蒂雷尔斯顿菌血症:三级护理医院环境中的一种新出现的感染。
摘要:雷氏杆菌是革兰氏阴性杆菌，已被越来越多的人认为是新出现的医院病原体，尤其在免疫功能低下的宿主中。皮氏雷尔氏菌是雷尔氏菌属中最重要的临床病原菌。据报告，由于使用受污染的医疗溶液，包括生理盐水、无菌水和消毒剂，在医院内暴发了皮克提拉斯氏菌感染。有不同表现的侵入性感染的病例报告。在这里，我们描述了在巴基斯坦卡拉奇的一家三级护理医院一年期间发生的3例皮克蒂拉斯顿菌血症。第一个病例是一位76岁的男性，已知的2型糖尿病(DM)，高血压，肌萎缩性侧索硬化症，他的主诉为烧灼性排尿，血尿和发烧。患者在最近的过去有多次住院史。他的血液培养结果显示皮凯蒂氏菌阳性。肾脏、输尿管及膀胱的电脑断层扫描提示肾盂肾炎。病人经静脉注射美罗培南后情况有所好转。第二例为一名47岁男子，因颈部枪伤而入院，导致颈髓完全切除，轻度脑积水伴脑室内出血。患者在重症监护室(ICU)住了很长时间，并发呼吸机相关肺炎伴不动杆菌和pickettii Ralstonia伴中央静脉相关血流感染(CLABSI)。他的治疗与美罗培南和粘菌素，但继续恶化和过期。第三个病例是一位46岁的女士，已知病例终末期肾病(ESRD)，因人工瓣膜心内膜炎入院。她在医院呆了很长一段时间，因为伴有拉斯托尼娅·皮克提的克拉伯氏病而变得复杂，在美罗培南治疗后病情有所好转，但后来死于真菌病。皮凯蒂Ralstonia pickettii是一种新出现的引起患者医院感染的原因，特别是那些住院时间较长的患者，可引起侵入性和严重感染。"

TITLE:Distribution of Legionella species and serogroups in patients with culture-confirmed Legionella pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Legionella species are consistently identified as some of the most common causative agents of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial pneumonia. Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup.

TITLE:Microbiological profile of ventilator-associated pneumonia among intensive care unit patients in tertiary Egyptian hospitals.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the common serious infectious diseases encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU), which highly affects the healthcare cost and patient prognosis. VAP is caused by various antimicrobial-resistant aetiological agents and the clinical manifestations lack sensitivity and specificity, making the prompt treatment is a challenge. This study aimed to investigate the microbial profile of VAP causing microorganisms among ICU patients in Egypt, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the genetic diversity among the frequently isolated organisms. METHODOLOGY: Throughout the period from August 2016 to August 2017, endotracheal aspirate (ETA) specimens were collected from ICU patients with clinically suspected VAP in two tertiary hospitals in Cairo. ETA specimens were investigated for the microbial content. The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Kirby-Bauer method. ERIC-PCR was performed for genotyping. 
RESULTS: Fifty microbiologically confirmed VAP cases were identified. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Klebsiella spp., followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii. Candida spp. was the most isolated fungi. A single isolate of each Cupriavidus pauculus and Aeromonas salmonicida was isolated. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles indicated 40% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). ERIC-PCR revealed no genetic relatedness among K. pneumoniae isolates, the most frequently isolated microorganism. 
CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are the main causative agents of VAP cases, which mostly are MDR. Microorganisms like C. pauculus and A. salmonicida should be taken into consideration as VAP causative agents. There was no common source of infection suggesting likely endogenous sources of K. pneumoniae, the main causative agent of VAP in this study.

结果:经微生物学证实的VAP病例50例。最常分离的微生物是克雷伯氏菌，其次是铜绿假单胞菌、鲍曼不动杆菌。念珠菌是分离度最高的真菌。分别分离出嗜铜菌和嗜沙门氏气单胞菌的单个分离物。抗菌药物敏感谱显示，40%的分离株具有多药耐药(MDR)。ERIC-PCR检测结果显示肺炎克雷伯菌(最常分离的微生物)之间没有遗传相关性。
结论:革兰氏阴性菌是VAP的主要病原菌，以MDR居多。像泡梭菌和杀沙门氏菌这样的微生物应考虑作为VAP的病原体。没有常见的感染源，提示可能是内源性肺炎克雷伯菌，这是本研究中VAP的主要病原体。"

TITLE:[MORAXELLA OSLOENSIS BACTEREMIA WITH PNEUMONIA: FIRST REPORTED CASE IN ISRAEL].
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP), an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma acquired in the community, is generally treated in an outpatient setting and involves different etiological agents. In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests. Our patient showed remarkable clinical and laboratory improvement with the therapy mentioned above.

TITLE:Isolation of Bordetella trematum from the respiratory tract of a patient with lung cancer: a case report.
ABSTRACT:We report the case of isolation of Bordetella trematum from the respiratory tract of a patient with lung carcinoma. This gram-negative, opportunistic rod was firstly described in 1996. To date, only several strains of Bordetella trematum have been isolated and reported, mostly from skin and soft tissue infections. The patient was admitted to the ICU of the Pulmonary Department in incipient septic shock with respiratory failure. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and non-invasive ventilation were administered immediately. A broad spectrum antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam was administered empirically after sampling of material for microbiological examination. The bronchoscopy showed a large cavern of decayed tumour invading into mediastinum. Both sample cultures showed significant quantities of gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria. The isolate was identified using MALDI-TOF MS as Bordetella trematum and the identification was confirmed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. In the last few years, routine bacterial identification using MALDI-TOF MS has enabled correct discrimination of this species. Nevertheless, isolation of Bordetella trematum in clinical samples is still very uncommon, and it is appropriate to confirm the species identification via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first case of B. trematum isolated from the human respiratory tract since its first description. The clinical significance of Bordetella trematum in the rapid deterioration of the patient's status remains unclear.

TITLE:Ralstonia mannitolilytica, an unusual pathogen in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: a case of neonatal sepsis and literature review.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Premature infants are considered high-risk subgroup for neonatal sepsis due to yet defective immune system, interventions practised and synergy of factors favoring multiple resistance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens to antimicrobial agents. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of late-onset neonatal sepsis in a premature infant caused by an uncommon pathogen; a premature infant of extremely low birth weight had in his 4th week of life severe clinical deterioration with lethargy, fever, pallor, 1 mottling, abdominal distention, tachycardia, and worsening respiratory impairment. Full septic screen was performed, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated and supportive care per needs was provided. Blood cultures (and endotracheal tube tip cultures) isolated meropenem- and gentamicin-resistant strain of rare pathogen Ralstonia mannitolilytica. Ralstonia spp are aerobic, Gram-negative, lactose nonfermenting, oxidase- and catalase-positive bacilli, thriving in water and soil. Ralstonia spp are identified only sporadically as causative agents of neonatal sepsis; to our knowledge this is the second report of neonatal sepsis due to R. mannitolilytica in the literature so far. Our patient was eventually treated (per sensitivity pattern) with intravenous ciprofloxacin, and recovered well from the infection. 
CONCLUSION: We intend to raise awareness among neonatologists with regards to early detection of unusual pathogens, emergence of antibiotic resistance patterns, and obligation for adherence to infection control policies.

TITLE:Delftia acidovorans pneumonia with lung cavities formation.
ABSTRACT:Case Description: A 52-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints of cough, sputum, fever and fatigue. The patient has been receiving immunosuppressive therapy for thrombocytopenic purpura for 5 years. Clinical Finding: Inspiratory crackles were heard on both hemithorax. Oxygen saturation measured with the pulse oximeter was 97%. Chest X-ray showed diffuse reticular opacities that were more prominent in the upper zones of both lungs. WBC counts were 17,600 mm3 and Platelet counts were 29,000 mm3. Thorax CT showed that there were many thin-walled cavities and millimetric nodules accompanied by ground-glass infiltrates in the upper and middle lobes. Gram staining of bronchial fluid, taken by bronchoscopy, revealed Gram-negative bacilli and intense polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The bacteria were defined as Delftia acidovorans by BD Phoenix automated system. Treatment and outcomes: The patient was hospitalized with suspicion of opportunistic pulmonary infections and cavitary lung disease. After the empirical treatment of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and oral clarithromycin, her clinical and radiological findings significantly regressed, and she was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Clinical Relevance: This is the first example of cavitary pneumonia due to Delftia acidovorans in an immunocompromised patient. We would like to emphasize that Delftia pneumonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary cavitary involvement in such patients.

TITLE:Molecular characterization of a multidrug-resistant/pandrug-resistant nosocomial polymicrobial infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, and Acinetobacter baumannii from Rural Maharashtra, India.
ABSTRACT:The emergence of resistance against commonly used antibiotics has become a serious global concern. The rapid development of antibiotic resistance exhibited by Enterobacteriaceae has caused an increasing concern regarding untreatable bacterial infections. Here, we isolated four pathogens from a geriatric female patient who was hospitalized for a month with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fever. The organisms isolated from the tracheal aspirates and urine included Klebsiella pneumoniae, pandrug-resistant Providencia rettgeri, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistome analysis indicated that the bacterial isolates from the polymicrobial infection were multiple-drug resitnat and pandrug resistant clones. Molecular characterization revealed presence of blaTEM-1 in K. pneumonaie, P. rettgeri and A. baumannii. The blaTEM-1 and blaNDM-1 genes were present in P. rettgeri and A. baumannii, whereas the blaTEM-1, blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23 traits were present in A. baumannii isolates. The patient has died due to the unavailability of effective antimicrobial treatment for this drug-resistant polymicrobial infection.

ABSTRACT:Exposure to and consumption of brackish water are associated with an elevated risk of infection, hypernatremia, and hypothermia. Minimal data exist to support the diagnosis and treatment of patients with long-term brackish water exposure. We present a case of a patient who spent 5 to 10 d semisubmerged in the Elizabeth River in coastal Virginia. A 55-y-old male presented via ambulance after 5 to 10 d of being ""stuck in the mud."" He was hypernatremic, with a sodium of 176 mEq L-1, hypothermic to 35 C (94.1 F), and hypotensive at 88/50 mm Hg, with a sodium concentration of 176 mEq L-1 and an osmolality of 412 mosm kg-1. He developed pneumonia, with respiratory cultures growing Vibrio parahemolyticus, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Shewanella algae. He had pustules, which grew Aeromonas hydrophilia and Aeromonas caviae. A nasogastric tube was placed. Using suction, 500 mL of coarse sand and gravel was removed from his stomach. Antibiotics and intravenous fluids were given. The patient fully recovered after 3 wk and was discharged to rehabilitation. Exposure to brackish water can present a unique set of infectious and metabolic complications. Initial care should include treatment of metabolic derangements, such as hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and hypothermia, and treatment of infections with antibiotics based on knowledge of the most likely causative organisms.

ABSTRACT:Alcaligenes faecalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is commonly found in the environment. This pathogen is usually transmitted in the form of droplets through ventilation equipment and nebulizers, but transmission through direct contact has also been documented in few case reports. This pathogen can cause rare but fatal infections including appendicitis, abscesses, meningitis, bloodstream infection, endocarditis, and post-operative endophthalmitis. Pan drug resistance to all commercially available antibiotics has been emerging globally. We present the case of a 66-year-old male who had respiratory failure along with multiple comorbidities. A large cavitary lesion caused by pan drug-resistant Alcaligenes faecalis was found on chest imaging. Despite the treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the clinical outcome was very poor.

TITLE:Clinical and drug resistance characteristics of Providencia stuartii infections in 76 patients.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical and drug resistance characteristics of Providencia stuartii infections in the Huainan region of Anhui and provide a reference for the clinical selection of antimicrobial agents. 
METHODS: This single-center retrospective analysis included 76 patients with P. stuartii infection in Huainan during the period from October 2018 to March 2020. The hospital department in which the patients were treated and the drug susceptibility characteristics of the P. stuartii isolates were recorded. 
RESULTS: Among the 76 patients, the lung was the most common site of infection, and intensive care unit was the main hospital department. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase screening revealed expression by all 76 isolates of P. stuartii. Of the 76 isolates, 92.1% exhibited multiple drug resistance or extensive drug resistance. P. stuartii isolates were sensitive to cefepime and imipenem, but not to other beta-lactam antibiotics. Twenty isolates were resistant to all 21 types of antibiotics. Of the 20 patients infected with extensively drug-resistant isolates, nine (45%) died. 
CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance is increasing in P. stuartii. The antimicrobial agent imipenem may be effective for treatment of P. stuartii infections. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and fourth-generation cephalosporins are suitable options for antibiotic therapy.

TITLE:Molecular Epidemiology of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii Complex Isolated From Children at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez.
ABSTRACT:The Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb) complex is regarded as a group of phenotypically indistinguishable opportunistic pathogens responsible for mainly causing hospital-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of isolation of the species that constitute the Acb complex, as well as their susceptibility to antibiotics, and their distribution at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). A total of 88 strains previously identified by Vitek 2 , 40 as Acinetobacter baumannii and 48 as Acb complex were isolated from 52 children from 07, January 2015 to 28, September 2017. A. baumannii accounted for 89.77% (79/88) of the strains; Acinetobacter pittii, 6.82% (6/88); and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, 3.40% (3/88). Most strains were recovered mainly from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency wards. Blood cultures (BC) provided 44.32% (39/88) of strains. The 13.63% (12/88) of strains were associated with primary bacteremia, 3.4% (3/88) with secondary bacteremia, and 2.3% (2/88) with pneumonia. In addition, 44.32% (39/88) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains and, 11.36% (10/88) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). All strains amplified the bla OXA-51 gene; 51.13% (45/88), the bla OXA-23 gene; 4.54% (4/88), the bla OXA-24 gene; and 2.27% (2/88), the bla OXA-58 gene. Plasmid profiles showed that the strains had 1-6 plasmids. The strains were distributed in 52 pulsotypes, and 24 showed identical restriction patterns, with a correlation coefficient of 1.0. Notably, some strains with the same pulsotype were isolated from different patients, wards, or years, suggesting the persistence of more than one clone. Twenty-seven sequence types (STs) were determined for the strains based on a Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme using massive sequencing; the most prevalent was ST 156 (27.27%, 24/88). The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas I-Fb system provided amplification in A. baumannii and A. pittii strains (22.73%, 20/88). This study identified an increased number of MDR strains and the relationship among strains through molecular typing. The data suggest that more than one strain could be causing an infection in some patient. The implementation of molecular epidemiology allowed the characterization of a set of strains and identification of different attributes associated with its distribution in a specific environment.

TITLE:Hafnia alvei pneumonia: a rare cause of infection in the multimorbid or immunocompromised.
ABSTRACT:Hafnia alvei is a rare, poorly understood commensal bacterium which has, on occasion, been shown to infect humans. We present two cases. The first patient presented with a 1-week history of dyspnoea, pleurisy and a productive cough, and the second with a prodrome of fatigue and night sweats. The former had a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the latter had a history of Crohn's disease. Both patients had underlying comorbidities and immunosuppression, but differed in presentation, radiological findings and recovery. This case series aims to remind readers of the broad differential of pathogens that can lead to disease in the immunocompromised and that one should not dismiss atypical cultured bacteria as commensal too hastily.
