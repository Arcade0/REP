TITLE:Characterization of a novel variant of Mycobacterium chimaera.
ABSTRACT:In this study, nonchromogenic mycobacteria were isolated from pulmonary samples of three patients in the Netherlands. All isolates had identical, unique 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S ITS sequences, which were closely related to those of Mycobacterium chimaera and Mycobacterium marseillense. The biochemical features of the isolates differed slightly from those of M. chimaera, suggesting that the isolates may represent a possible separate species within the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). However, the cell-wall mycolic acid pattern, analysed by HPLC, and the partial sequences of the hsp65 and rpoB genes were identical to those of M. chimaera. We concluded that the isolates represent a novel variant of M. chimaera. The results of this analysis have led us to question the currently used methods of species definition for members of the genus Mycobacterium, which are based largely on 16S rRNA or rpoB gene sequencing. Definitions based on a single genetic target are likely to be insufficient. Genetic divergence, especially in the MAC, yields strains that cannot be confidently assigned to a specific species based on the analysis of a single genetic target."

TITLE:[Unusual gram positive rods, causing pneumonia].
ABSTRACT:In the last decade, a growing number of patients with pneumonia, caused by unusual gram positive rods have been observed. Mostly, the patients had been infected as a consequence of impaired immunity. In some cases, bioterrorist activities may also induce pneumonia by gram positive rods (B. anthracis). In order to bring these organisms to the attention of the medical community, we present three clinical cases and describe six species of gram positive rods, known to provoke this kind of pneumonias. Case 1 was a 84 years old patient with impaired lung function. He was suspicious of tuberculosis (Tbc). Nocardia spec. was isolated. Case 2 was an alcoholic of 46 years with pneumonia. Reactivation of Tbc was suspected. Actinomadura madurae has been isolated. Case 3 was a patient of 58 years with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and pneumonia. N. asteroides was isolated. All patients shared impaired immunity (age, alcoholism, MDS) with impaired lung functions; Tbc had been suspected (Case 1 + 2). Infection by A. madurae was contained by Clindamycin. Therapy of Nocardia with Moxifloxacin (Case 1) or Bactrim (Case 3) was only partly effective. In the appendix, six species of gram positive rods which are known to cause pneumonia, are summarized (Nocardia, Actinomyceta, Actinomadura, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Bacillus)."

TITLE:Isolation, biochemical and molecular identification of Nocardia species among TB suspects in northeastern, Tanzania; a forgotten or neglected threat?
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nocardiosis mimic pulmonary tuberculosis in most clinical and radiological manifestations. In Tanzania, where tuberculosis is one of the major public health threat clinical impact of nocardiosis as the cause of the human disease remains unknown. The objective of the present study was to isolate and identify Nocardia isolates recovered from TB suspects in Northeastern, Tanzania by using biochemical and molecular methods. 
METHODS: The study involved 744 sputum samples collected from 372 TB suspects from four periphery diagnostic centers in Northeastern, Tanzania. Twenty patients were diagnosed as having presumptively Nocardia infections based on microscopic, cultural characteristics and biomerieux ID 32C Yeast Identification system and confirmed using 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene specific primers for Nocardia species and sequencing. 
RESULTS: Biochemically, the majority of the isolates were N. asteroides (n = 8/20, 40%), N. brasiliensis (n = 4/20, 20%), N. farcinica (n = 3/20, 15%), N. nova (n = 1/20, 5%). Other aerobic actinomycetales included Streptomyces cyanescens (n = 2/20, 10%), Streptomyces griseus, Actinomadura madurae each (n = 1/20, 5%). Results of 16S rRNA and hsp65 sequencing were concordant in 15/17 (88. 2%) isolates and discordant in 2/17 (11.8%) isolates. Majority of the isolates belonged to N. cyriacigeorgica and N. farcinica, four (23.5%) each. 
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Nocardia species may be an important cause of pulmonary nocardiosis that is underdiagnosed or ignored. This underscores needs to consider pulmonary nocardiosis as a differential diagnosis when there is a failure of anti-TB therapy and as a possible cause of human infections.

坦桑尼亚东北部地区结核疑似病例中诺卡菌的分离、生化和分子鉴定;一个被遗忘或忽视的威胁?
文摘:
背景:肺部诺卡氏菌病在大多数临床和放射学表现上与肺结核相似。在坦桑尼亚，结核病是主要的公共卫生威胁之一，诺卡氏菌病作为人类疾病病因的临床影响仍不清楚。本研究的目的是利用生化和分子方法分离和鉴定从坦桑尼亚东北部地区结核疑似病例中回收的诺卡菌。
方法:该研究涉及来自坦桑尼亚东北部4个周边诊断中心372名结核疑似患者的744份痰样本。根据显微镜、培养特征和biomerieux ID 32C酵母鉴定系统，20例患者被确诊为诺卡菌感染，并使用16S rRNA和hsp65基因特异性引物对诺卡菌种类进行鉴定和测序。
结果:从生物化学上看，分离株以菊苣苣苔(n = 8/ 20,40%)、巴西苣苔(n = 4/ 20,20%)、褐飞虱(n = 3/ 20,15%)、新苣苔苣苔(n = 1/ 20,5%)为主。其他需氧放线菌包括青链霉菌(Streptomyces cyananescens, n = 2/ 20,10%)、灰链霉菌(Streptomyces griseus, Actinomadura madurae, n = 1/ 20,5%)。16S rRNA与hsp65测序结果一致(88 /17)。2/17株分离株不一致(11.8%)。分离株主要属于cyriacigeorgica和farcinica，各4株(23.5%)。
结论:我们的发现表明诺卡菌种类可能是肺部诺卡菌病的一个重要原因，但诊断不足或被忽视。这强调需要考虑在抗结核治疗失败时将肺部诺卡氏菌病作为一种鉴别诊断，并作为人类感染的一种可能原因。"

TITLE:Actinomadura sputi sp. nov., isolated from the sputum of a patient with pulmonary infection.
ABSTRACT:The taxonomic position of an actinomycete, strain IMMIB L-889(T), isolated from the sputum of a 64-year-old man, was determined using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The strain had chemical and morphological properties that were consistent with its classification in the genus Actinomadura. It formed a distinct phyletic line in the 16S rRNA gene tree of Actinomadura and was most closely related to the type strain of Actinomadura hallensis (98.4 % sequence similarity), but could be readily distinguished from the latter species using DNA-DNA relatedness and phenotypic data. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data indicate that strain IMMIB L-889(T) represents a novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura sputi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMMIB L-889(T) =DSM 45233(T)=CCUG 56589(T). [corrected]"

ABSTRACT:A 20-year-old woman developed symptoms of pharyngitis followed by generalised skin rash and pulmonary infiltrates with cavitation. Arcanobacterium haemolyticum was identified in blood culture, which was susceptible to the antibiotics given. After initiating pathogen-directed therapy, the patient recovered completely. A. haemolyticum is a Gram-positive rod that can grow under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The pathogen causes a characteristic haemolysis when cultured on human blood agar. A. haemolyticum causes pharyngitis and skin rash, particularly in adolescents. If the infection is not treated adequately, progression to more severe infections such as pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis can occur. The treatment of choice is a macrolide antibiotic."

TITLE:Severe sepsis caused by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum: a case report and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of severe sepsis, cavitary pneumonia, and pyomyositis caused by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. CASE SUMMARY: An 18-year-old male with a medical history significant for mild asthma presented to the emergency department complaining of a 7-day history of fever, diffuse myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain in his right upper quadrant, right shoulder, and left thigh. Cultures of blood, bronchoalveolar fluid, and surface and surgical swabs from the patient's left lower extremity grew A. haemolyticum. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous penicillin G 4 million units every 4 hours and azithromycin 500 mg once daily for 14 days. Within 36 hours after initiation of focused therapy, he became afebrile, pain decreased, and pulmonary symptoms abated. Oral azithromycin 500 mg/day for an additional 3 weeks was prescribed on discharge, and the patient showed no relapse at 2-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: A. haemolyticum is a weakly acid-fast, branching gram-positive bacillus most commonly implicated in pharyngitis in healthy adolescents and skin and soft-tissue infections in older, immunocompromised patients. Systemic infections are rarely reported in the literature. This organism remains susceptible to most classes of antimicrobials, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, macrolides, tetracyclines, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Routine resistance has been reported only with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. 
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, there are no published case reports of severe sepsis caused by A. haemolyticum. While treatment options are numerous, we recommend the use of intravenous penicillin or a cephalosporin as first-line pharmacologic management of deep-seated infections caused by this rare organism."

TITLE:Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae caused different microbial structure and correlation network in lung microbiota.
ABSTRACT:Pneumonia is one of the most serious diseases for children, with which lung microbiota are proved to be associated. We performed 16S rDNA analysis on broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for 32 children with tracheomalacia (C group), pneumonia infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (D1 group) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) (D2 group). Children with tracheomalacia held lower microbial diversity and accumulated Lactococcus (mean +- SD, 45.21%+-5.07%, P value &lt;0.05), Porphyromonas (0.12%+-0.31%, P value &lt;0.05). D1 and D2 group were enriched by Streptococcus (7.57%+-11.61%, P value &lt;0.01 when compared with D2 group) and Mycoplasma (0.67%+-1.25%, P value &lt;0.01) respectively. Bacterial correlation in C group was mainly intermediated by Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter. Whilst, D1 group harbored simplest microbial correlation in three groups, and D2 group held the most complicated network, involving enriched Staphylococcus (0.26%+-0.71%), Massilia (0.81%+-2.42%). This will be of significance for understanding pneumonia incidence and progression more comprehensively, and discerning between bacterial infection and carriage.

TITLE:Microbiological investigation and clinical significance of Corynebacterium spp. in respiratory specimens.
ABSTRACT:The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the pathogenic role of Corynebacterium species in lower respiratory tract infections as well as their routine laboratory investigation. From April 2007 to August 2009, 27 clinical isolates were significantly recovered from respiratory specimens of 27 different patients clinically suspected of having lower respiratory tract infections. The average age of patients was 65 years, while 22 (81%) patients presented at least 1 predisposing condition. Of the 27 patients, 15 (56%) were classified as infected according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network criteria, with 93% of infections being hospital acquired. All isolates were accurately identified to the species level using molecular methods (i.e., 17 Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, 7 Corynebacterium striatum, and 3 Corynebacterium accolens), whereas phenotypic methods remained frequently unreliable for identifying C. striatum and C. accolens strains. All tested isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin, imipenem, vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline, whereas most of them were resistant to erythromycin."

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To study the diagnosis and treatment of Corynebacterium aquaticum infection. 
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of one case of Corynebacterium aquaticum infection and literature review were conducted. 
RESULTS: A 39-year old male patient was admitted because of cough, sputum production, fever and right chest pain for 10 days. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy had been given in another hospital, but the patient's condition had deteriorated.Nuclear magnetic resonance-guided percutancous transthoracic needle aspiration and lung tissue, pleural fluid and blood culture were performed after admission to our hospital. Corynebacterium aquaticum was grown from the lung tissue, the blood and the pleural effusion. Therefore the diagnosis of Corynebacterium aquaticum pneumonia complicated with pyothorax and septicemia was confirmed. After draining of pleural pus and intravenous vancomycin therapy, the patient recovered and was discharged from hospital. After literature search, we did not find reports on Corynebacterium aquaticum pneumonia complicated with pyothorax and septicemia. 
CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium aquaticum pneumonia complicated with pyothorax and septicemia is rare. The diagnosis could be confirmed by bacterial culture of lung tissue, pleural fluid and blood. Thoracic cavity draining and intravenous vancomycin are effective therapies for the disease."

ABSTRACT:The authors used vancomycin (VCM) to treat Corynebacterium jeikeium bacteraemia and pulmonary infiltrates in a patient with acute myelogenous leukaemia. Pulmonary infiltrates are found in about one-third of patients with haematological pathologies accompanying C jeikeium bacteraemia. Although linezolid and daptomycin are antimicrobial alternatives for treating Corynebacterium infections, the authors believe that VCM is the best choice for immediate treatment success and to prevent pulmonary infiltrates from developing in the presence of bloodstream infection with Corynebacteria in patients with haematological malignancies."

TITLE:Corynebacterium macginleyi: A cause of ventilator associated pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient.
ABSTRACT:PURPOSE AND IMPORTANCE: Corynebacterium macginleyi, a lipophilic diphtheroid from the genus Corynebacteria, is a known cause of conjunctivitis. It was recently reported as a cause of serious infections in immunocompromised individuals. It has never been reported as a cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia, that which carries a high burden and risk of mortality. Our report intends to increase awareness of a potentially lethal nosocomial bacterial infection. OBSERVATIONS: This case reports on a 73 year old lady with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma on chemotherapy, who was hospitalized for dyspnea and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in 2011. Trans-bronchial biopsies revealed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The patient improved with steroids. Failure to wean ensued with a bronchopleural fistula, increase in secretions, oxygen requirements, and appearance of new infiltrates. Two mini-BAL cultures yielded gram positive pleomorphic rods with palisade arrangement, diagnosed as C. macginleyi. Vancomycin therapy was initiated. She improved and was successfully extubated. 
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Non-diphtheria Corynebacteria usually form normal flora. If isolated, they are often dismissed as contaminants. C. macginleyi has emerged as a life-threatening nosocomial infection. Prompt identification and treatment are required. It is resistant to quinolones. Thus far, vancomycin is the preferred treatment.

TITLE:Corynebacterium species as one of the major causative pathogens of bacterial pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Recent advances using molecular methods, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flightmass spectrometry, and next-generation sequencers enable rapid and precise detection of bacterial species in the clinical samples, revealing bacterial diversities in the human body. Corynebacterium species are Gram-positive bacilli, which can cause pneumonia and have been reported as causative pathogens of lower respiratory tract infections since the 1970's. However, Corynebacterium spp. may be recognized and sorted as part of normal respiratory flora on Gram staining and culture, resulting in clinical under-recognition as pathogenic bacteria. The results of the clone library method using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis in Japanese patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia revealed that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the lung lesions contained 11.8% Corynebacterium spp., which was the second most predominant bacterial phylotype. Additionally, among patients in whom Corynebacterium spp. were detected, C. simulans was most commonly detected followed by C. striatum. In addition, almost half of the patients in whom C. simulans was detected was monophylotypic infection and/or co-detection of C. simulansand C. striatum. Further clinical information is expected on corynebacteria as pathogens of lower respiratory tract infection.

TITLE:Corynebacterium sputi sp. nov., isolated from the sputum of a patient with pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:A coryneform bacterium isolated from the sputum of a patient with pneumonia was characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Chemotaxonomic investigations revealed the presence of cell-wall chemotype IV and short chain mycolic acids consistent with the genus Corynebacterium. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies confirmed this assignment, with the organism forming a hitherto unknown subline within the genus associated with a subcluster containing Corynebacterium hansenii, Corynebacterium freneyi, Corynebacterium xerosis, Corynebacterium amycolatum and Corynebacterium sphenisci. Sequence divergence values of &gt;2.7 % from established corynebacterial species suggested that the new isolate represented a novel species. This was also supported by the results of the biochemical tests. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as a novel species of the genus Corynebacterium, Corynebacterium sputi sp. nov. (type strain IMMIB L-999(T)=DSM 45148(T)=CCUG 55795(T))."

TITLE:Postoperative deep wound dehiscence of thoracotomy with isolation of Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum: surgical site infection or colonization?
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: Infections with Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum are very rare as in most of the cases its isolation is associated with tissue colonization rather than infection. CASE REPORT: An 80-year old female patient was sent to the consultation hour of thoracic surgery for evaluation of a symptomatic persistent unilateral pleural effusion of her right lung. The differential diagnosis included either the presence of a chronic pleural empyema or the presence of malignancy. After excluding a malignancy, a decortication of the middle and lower lobe was performed, as the two lobes could not significantly re-expand. The course was further complicated by the presence of two-times deep wound dehiscence, which made necessary a rethoracotomy. The microbiologic results of the biopsies revealed the presence of only Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum with an initially questionable clinical relevance. As soon as the antibiotic treatment for Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum began, together with the use of vacuum-assisted therapy (VAC), the closure of the thoracotomy was accelerated. 
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant surgical site infections with Corynebacterium species in thoracic surgery are difficult to distinguish. Nevertheless, its combined surgical and antibiotic treatment is warranted when its relevance is questionable due to its resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as to its potential for the complicated clinical course.

TITLE:Respiratory Bacterial Microbiota and Individual Bacterial Variability in Lung Cancer and Bronchiectasis Patients.
ABSTRACT:Respiratory bacterial microbiota plays a key role in human health. Lung cancer microbiome is a significant yet an understudied area while bronchiectasis microbiome is often studied. We assessed the bacterial microbiota in the upper and lower respiratory tract of the patients with lung cancer and bronchiectasis against a healthy group and their variations in individuality. 16S rRNA gene based metagenomic sequencing was used to detect entire bacterial community along with conventional aerobic bacterial culturing. In comparison to healthy, increased bacterial diversity was observed in diseased population. Abundance of more than 1% was considered and bacteria were identified in 97% similarity. Only lung cancer patients exhibited bacteria specific to the disease: Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Keratinibaculum paraultunense. However, Enterococcus faecalis and Delftia tsuruhatensis were also observed limited to lung cancer and bronchiectasis respectively, in less than 1% but supported with bacterial culturing. In conclusion the disease condition and intra-group variability should be considered in future with larger cohorts to understand individual patient variability highlighting the social habits and gender of the individual.

TITLE:[The sensitivity to antibiotics of Corynebacterium non diphtheriae isolated in hospitals of Rostov-on-Don and the Rostovskaia oblast.]
ABSTRACT:The purpose of study is to analyze sensitivity of various species Corynebacterium non diphtheriae to antibacterial pharmaceuticals. The strains of C. non diphtheriae are separated from patients with pathology of respiratory and urogenital tract and also from individuals subjected to preventive examination. The sensitivity to antibacterial pharmaceuticals was determined using technique of serial dilution in fluid growth medium on the basis values of minimal inhibitory concentration (mg per l). It is established that the most efficient antibacterial pharmaceuticals in the case of strains C. non diphtheriae proved to be Vancomycin, Cefazolin and Cefotaxime in general. In case of such particular species as S. pseudodiphtheriticum -- Cefazolin, Cefotaxime and Gentamycin; S.pseudotuberculosis -- Vancomycin, Cefazolin, Cefotaxime and Gentamycin; C. xerosis -- Cefotaxime; S.striatum -- Cefazolin and i Rifampicin. The least efficiency was manifested for strains C. non diphtheriae by Benzylpenicillin and Lincomycin in general. In case of such particular species as S. pseudodiphtheriticum and S. pseudotuberculosis -- Lincomycin and Erythromycin; C. xerosis and S. striatum -- Benzylpenicillin, Lincomycin and Erythromycin. In case of various species of C. non diphtheriae Sephalosporins (Cefotaxime and Cefazolin) can be recommended as pharmaceuticals of choice and Gentamycin and Vancomycin as reserve pharmaceuticals.

TITLE:Gardnerella vaginalis causing pulmonary infection in a young adult: A novel case.
ABSTRACT:Gardnerella vaginalis is an anaerobic, gram-variable bacterium primarily found in vaginal microflora of women. Previous reports of G. vaginalis cultured in men are few and have primarily been limited to the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract.2-4 Few reports of G. vaginalis causing severe infections have been reported in the literature, including septicemia7 and two cases of perinephric abscess.8,9 There has been one previously reported case of G. vaginalis causing pulmonary complications that occurred in a male alcohol abuser. In our case review, we aim to demonstrate an unusual source of a pulmonary infection and highlight the importance of proper microbial isolation to guide treatment. Our patient is a young male who presented following multiple gunshot wounds including one to his head causing an intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and a dural sinus thrombosis. His hospital course was complicated by a decline in neurological status treated with a craniotomy and external drain placement and multiple pulmonary infections. During his fever work-ups, he found to have G. vaginalis on mini-bronchoalveolar lavage and was subsequently treated with metronidazole. After treating his G. vaginalis pneumonia and other infectious sources, namely Haemaphilus influenzae and coagulase-negative staphylococcus pneumonias, his fevers and leukocytosis resolved and he was successfully discharged to a rehabilitation facility for neurologic recovery. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of G. vaginalis isolated from a pulmonary culture and the first in a previously healthy, immunocompetent young male outside of the urinary tract.

TITLE:Gordonia iterans sp. nov., isolated from a patient with pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:A second novel clinical actinobacterial strain, designated IFM 10348(T), was isolated from the sputum of the same Japanese patient with bacterial pneumonia from whom the type strain of Gordonia araii had been isolated. The strains differed in phylogenetic position and drug-resistance profiles. The taxonomic position of strain IFM 10348(T) was clarified by phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences clearly demonstrated that strain IFM 10348(T) occupied a distinct clade within the genus Gordonia and was related closely to Gordonia malaquae DSM 45064(T) and Gordonia hirsuta DSM 44140(T) (97.3 and 97.1% similarities, respectively). Strain IFM 10348(T) was also clearly differentiated from G. malaquae DSM 45064(T) and G. hirsuta DSM 44140(T) based on gyrB and secA1 gene sequence similarity values. Strain IFM 10348(T) had MK-9(H2) as the predominant menaquonine, contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose, galactose and glucosamine as cell-wall components, and contained C18:1omega9c, summed feature 3 (C16:1omega7c and/or C16:1omega6c) and C16:0 as the major cellular fatty acids. Mycolic acids were present. The DNA G+C content of strain IFM 10348(T) was 68.0 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness data coupled with the combination of genotypic and phenotypic data indicated that strain IFM 10348(T) represents a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia iterans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IFM 10348(T) ( = CCTCC M2011245(T) = NCCB 100436(T)).

TITLE:Identification of Species of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Clinical Isolates from 8 Provinces of China.
ABSTRACT:Pulmonary diseases caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide. In this study, we identified NTM species of the clinical isolates from 8 provinces in China, in order to preliminarily provide some basic scientific data in the different species and distribution of NTM related to pulmonary disease in China. A total of 523 clinical isolates from patients with tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed clinically from 2005 to 2012 were identified to the species using conventional and molecular methods, including multilocus PCR, rpoB and hsp65 PCR-PRA, hsp65, rpoB, and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region sequencing. The isolates were identified into 3 bacterium genera, including NTM, Gordonia bronchialis, and Nocardia farcinica, and, for the 488 NTM isolates, 27 species were identified. For all the 27 species of NTM which were found to cause pulmonary infections in humans, the most prevalent species was M. intracellulare, followed by M. avium and M. abscessus. And seven other species were for the first time identified in patients with TB in China. NTM species identification is very important for distinguishing between tuberculosis and NTM pulmonary diseases, and the species diversity drives the creation of diverse and integrated identification methods with higher accuracy and efficacy.

TITLE:Gordonia otitidis sp. nov., isolated from a patient with external otitis.
ABSTRACT:The taxonomic positions of two clinically isolated actinomycetes were established using a polyphasic approach. The two strains, IFM 10032(T), isolated from ear discharge of a 28-year-old Japanese female patient with external otitis, and IFM 10148, isolated from pleural fluid of a 60-year-old Japanese male patient with bronchitis, possessed meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic amino acid, MK-9(H(2)) as the predominant menaquinone and mycolic acids ranging from 58 to 64 carbons. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two strains were most closely related to those of Gordonia aichiensis, Gordonia sputi and 'Gordonia jacobaea'. Differences in several phenotypic characteristics together with genotypic distinctiveness distinguish strains IFM 10032(T) and IFM 10148 from these three species. DNA-DNA hybridization results and the combination of genotypic and phenotypic data showed that the two strains belong to a single species, and merit recognition of a novel species within the genus Gordonia. The name proposed for this taxon is Gordonia otitidis sp. nov.; the type strain is IFM 10032(T) (=DSM 44809(T)=JCM 12355(T)=NBRC 100426(T))."

TITLE:A rubber-degrading organism growing from a human body.
ABSTRACT:Patients with hematological malignancies are susceptible to unusual infections, because of the use of broad-spectrum anti-infective agents, invasive procedures, and other immunocompromising procedures and medications. Gordonia polyisoprenivorans, a ubiquitous environmental aerobic actinomycete belonging to the family of Gordoniaceae in the order Actinomycetales, is a very rare cause of bacteremia in these patients. We report the first case of pneumonia with associated bacteremia due to this organism, which was initially described in 1999 as a rubber-degrading bacterium following isolation from stagnant water inside a deteriorated automobile tire. We believe that hematologically immunocompromised patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics and with long-term central catheters select the possibility of infection with G. polyisoprenivorans. These infections can be prevented by handling catheters under aseptic conditions. We propose that blood cultures of persistently febrile neutropenic patients should be incubated for at least 4 weeks. Being a rare infection, there are no data available on treatment other than early removal of the foreign bodies."

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To determine the need for routine speciation of positive Lowenstein-Jensen mycobacterial cultures in HIV-infected patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. 
METHODS: Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage Lowenstein-Jensen mycobacterial culture isolates from consecutive, HIV-infected patients admitted to Mulago Hospital with 2 weeks or more of cough were subjected to IS6110 PCR and rpoB genetic analysis to determine the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). 
RESULTS: Eighty (100%) mycobacterial cultures from 65 patients were confirmed to be members of MTBC. Subsequent analysis of the cultures from 54 patients by PCR and sequence analyses to identify co-infection with NTM confirmed the presence of MTBC as well as the presence of Micrococcus luteus (n = 4), Janibacter spp. (n = 1) and six cultures had organisms that could not be identified. 
CONCLUSIONS: Presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis on the basis of a positive Lowenstein-Jensen culture is sufficient in HIV-infected Ugandans suspected of having tuberculosis. Routine molecular confirmation of positive Lowenstein-Jensen cultures is unnecessary in this low resource setting."

ABSTRACT:Three human clinical strains (W9323(T), X0209(T) and X0394) isolated from a lung biopsy, blood and cerebral spinal fluid, respectively, were characterised using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed the three strains belong to two novel branches within the genus Kroppenstedtia: 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of W9323(T) showed close sequence similarity to Kroppenstedtia eburnea JFMB-ATE(T) (95.3 %), Kroppenstedtia guangzhouensis GD02(T) (94.7 %) and strain X0209(T) (94.6 %); sequence analysis of strain X0209(T) showed close sequence similarity to K. eburnea JFMB-ATE(T) (96.4 %) and K. guangzhouensis GD02(T) (96.0 %). Strains X0209(T) and X0394 were 99.9 % similar to each other by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The DNA-DNA relatedness was 94.6 %, confirming that X0209(T) and X0394 belong to the same species. Chemotaxonomic data for strains W9323(T) and X0209(T) were consistent with those described for the members of the genus Kroppenstedtia: the peptidoglycan was found to contain LL-diaminopimelic acid; the major cellular fatty acids were identified as iso-C15 and anteiso-C15; and the major menaquinone was identified as MK-7. Differences in endospore morphology, carbon source utilisation profiles, and cell wall sugar patterns of strains W9323(T) and X0209(T), supported by phylogenetic analysis, enabled us to conclude that the strains each represent a new species within the genus Kroppenstedtia, for which the names Kroppenstedtia pulmonis sp. nov. (type strain W9323(T) = DSM 45752(T) = CCUG 68107(T)) and Kroppenstedtia sanguinis sp. nov. (type strain X0209(T) = DSM 45749(T) = CCUG 38657(T)) are proposed.

TITLE:[Evaluation of the distribution of non-tuberculous mycobacteria strains isolated in National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory in 2009-2010, Turkey].
ABSTRACT:Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are commonly encountered environmental bacteria, and most of them are associated with lung diseases. Diagnosis of infections caused by NTM is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological findings. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of non-tuberculous mycobacterial species isolated from clinical specimens as etiologic agents. The NTM strains isolated from clinical specimens in National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL), together with the strains that were sent to NTRL for the advanced identification of non-tuberculous mycobacterial species that have clinical or microbiological significance, were analysed retrospectively. The strains belonged to January 2009 - December 2010 period. If the same NTM type was isolated more than once in the clinical specimens of a patient, then it was defined microbiologically as a causative agent. Identification of mycobacteria species was performed by using a commercial line-probe assay (GenoType Mycobacterium CM/AS; Hain Lifescience, Germany). In our study, pulmonary and non-pulmonary samples obtained from 206 patients yielded mycobacterial growth in their cultures, and of them 24 (11.7%) were identified as NTM. On the other hand, 51 of the 101 samples sent to NTRL for identification were confirmed as NTM. Of the patients who were found to be infected with NTM (n= 75), 59 (78.7%) were male and the mean age was 50.9 +- 18.8 years. The most frequently identified NTM species was M.fortuitum (33.3%, n= 25), followed by M.abscessus (18.7%, n= 14), M.gordonae (10.7%, n= 8) and M.avium (%8; n= 6). The other types of NTM species identified in our laboratory were M.chelonae (n= 3), M.intracellulare (n= 3), M.kansasii (n= 3), M.peregrinum (n= 2), M.scrofulaceum (n= 2), M.szulgai (n= 2), M.celatum (n= 1), M.haemophilum (n= 1), M.smegmatis (n= 1) and M.xenopi (n= 1). Rapidly growing NTM species (M.fortuitum and M.abscessus) were the most frequent (52%) species isolated in our laboratory as the cause of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. Interestingly, the majority of M.fortuitum isolates (n= 21) which was the most common species identified in our laboratory, were those received from the peripheral laboratories. The most common species identified in our laboratory were rapidly growing NTM, however the countrywide distribution of the NTM species was found different than previously reported. In conclusion, further investigation of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria profile in adjunct with epidemiological data seems to be essential in our country."

TITLE:Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae caused different microbial structure and correlation network in lung microbiota.
ABSTRACT:Pneumonia is one of the most serious diseases for children, with which lung microbiota are proved to be associated. We performed 16S rDNA analysis on broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for 32 children with tracheomalacia (C group), pneumonia infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (D1 group) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) (D2 group). Children with tracheomalacia held lower microbial diversity and accumulated Lactococcus (mean +- SD, 45.21%+-5.07%, P value &lt;0.05), Porphyromonas (0.12%+-0.31%, P value &lt;0.05). D1 and D2 group were enriched by Streptococcus (7.57%+-11.61%, P value &lt;0.01 when compared with D2 group) and Mycoplasma (0.67%+-1.25%, P value &lt;0.01) respectively. Bacterial correlation in C group was mainly intermediated by Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter. Whilst, D1 group harbored simplest microbial correlation in three groups, and D2 group held the most complicated network, involving enriched Staphylococcus (0.26%+-0.71%), Massilia (0.81%+-2.42%). This will be of significance for understanding pneumonia incidence and progression more comprehensively, and discerning between bacterial infection and carriage.

TITLE:The role of speciation in positive Lowenstein-Jensen culture isolates from a high tuberculosis burden country.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To determine the need for routine speciation of positive Lowenstein-Jensen mycobacterial cultures in HIV-infected patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. 
METHODS: Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage Lowenstein-Jensen mycobacterial culture isolates from consecutive, HIV-infected patients admitted to Mulago Hospital with 2 weeks or more of cough were subjected to IS6110 PCR and rpoB genetic analysis to determine the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). 
RESULTS: Eighty (100%) mycobacterial cultures from 65 patients were confirmed to be members of MTBC. Subsequent analysis of the cultures from 54 patients by PCR and sequence analyses to identify co-infection with NTM confirmed the presence of MTBC as well as the presence of Micrococcus luteus (n = 4), Janibacter spp. (n = 1) and six cultures had organisms that could not be identified. 
CONCLUSIONS: Presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis on the basis of a positive Lowenstein-Jensen culture is sufficient in HIV-infected Ugandans suspected of having tuberculosis. Routine molecular confirmation of positive Lowenstein-Jensen cultures is unnecessary in this low resource setting."

TITLE:Identification of Species of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Clinical Isolates from 8 Provinces of China.
ABSTRACT:Pulmonary diseases caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasing in incidence and prevalence worldwide. In this study, we identified NTM species of the clinical isolates from 8 provinces in China, in order to preliminarily provide some basic scientific data in the different species and distribution of NTM related to pulmonary disease in China. A total of 523 clinical isolates from patients with tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed clinically from 2005 to 2012 were identified to the species using conventional and molecular methods, including multilocus PCR, rpoB and hsp65 PCR-PRA, hsp65, rpoB, and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region sequencing. The isolates were identified into 3 bacterium genera, including NTM, Gordonia bronchialis, and Nocardia farcinica, and, for the 488 NTM isolates, 27 species were identified. For all the 27 species of NTM which were found to cause pulmonary infections in humans, the most prevalent species was M. intracellulare, followed by M. avium and M. abscessus. And seven other species were for the first time identified in patients with TB in China. NTM species identification is very important for distinguishing between tuberculosis and NTM pulmonary diseases, and the species diversity drives the creation of diverse and integrated identification methods with higher accuracy and efficacy.

TITLE:Burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases in Saudi Arabian children: The first nationwide experience.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases are increasing worldwide. A large paucity of data related to pediatric NTM diseases exists globally and particularly in Saudi Arabia. 
METHODS: The first nationwide exploratory study on existence of NTM diseases among Saudi Arabian children (0-14 years old) has been carried out during 2016-2017. Suspected NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data were enrolled from regional reference laboratories. Species level identification of isolates was carried out by commercial line probe assays and gene sequencing. 
RESULTS: In 12 months, 52 culture positive cases with 44(84.6%) confirmed disease incidences were identified. Demographically, Saudi nationals (86.5%) were dominated and 77.3% cases have different comorbid conditions. Lymphadenitis (40.4%) followed by 26.9% of pulmonary cases with 42.8% of confirmed clinical relevance were mainly reported. Species identification showed Mycobacterium simiae (31.8%), M. abscessus (23.1%) and nine other species including rarely encountering M. riyadhense. Ascites caused by M. monacense, pulmonary disease caused by M. riyadhense and M. monacense were rarest clinical events and reported for the first time globally in a pediatric cohort. 
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse NTM diseases even in immunocompetent children are an upcoming challenge in Saudi Arabia. Lack of awareness on NTM disease must be addressed with immediate development of management plans.

TITLE:Emergence of Rare Species of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria as Potential Pathogens in Saudi Arabian Clinical Setting.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Clinical relevance of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is increasing worldwide including in Saudi Arabia. A high species diversity of NTM's has been noticed in a recent study. However, the identification in diagnostic laboratories is mostly limited to common species. The impact of NTM species diversity on clinical outcome is so far neglected in most of the clinical settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS: During April 2014 to September 2015, a nationwide collection of suspected NTM clinical isolates with clinical and demographical data were carried out. Primary identification was performed by commercial line probe assays. Isolates identified up to Mycobacterium species level by line probe assays only were included and subjected to sequencing of 16S rRNA, rpoB, hsp65 and 16S-23S ITS region genes. The sequence data were subjected to BLAST analysis in GenBank and Ez-Taxon databases. Male Saudi nationals were dominated in the study population and falling majorly into the 46-59 years age group. Pulmonary cases were 59.3% with a surprising clinical relevance of 75% based on American Thoracic Society guidelines. Among the 40.7% extra-pulmonary cases, 50% of them were skin infections. The identification revealed 16 species and all of them are reporting for the first time in Saudi Arabia. The major species obtained were Mycobacterium monascence (18.5%), M. cosmeticum (11.1%), M. kubicae (11.1%), M. duvalli (7.4%), M.terrae (7.4%) and M. triplex (7.4%). This is the first report on clinical relevance of M. kubicae, M. tusciae, M.yongonense, M. arupense and M.iranicum causing pulmonary disease and M. monascence, M. duvalli, M. perigrinum, M. insubricum, M. holsaticum and M. kyorinense causing various extra-pulmonary diseases in Saudi Arabia. Ascites caused by M. monascence and cecum infection by M. holsaticum were the rarest incidents. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To the first time in the country, clinical significance of various rare NTM's are well explored and the finding warrants a new threat to the Saudi Arabian clinical settings.

TITLE:Clinical significance of Mycobacterium asiaticum isolates in Queensland, Australia.
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium asiaticum was first reported as a cause of human disease in 1982, with only a few cases in the literature to date. This study aims to review the clinical significance of M. asiaticum isolates in Queensland, Australia. A retrospective review (1989 to 2008) of patients with M. asiaticum isolates was conducted. Data were collected through the Queensland TB Control Centre database. Disease was defined in accordance with the American Thoracic Society criteria. Twenty-four patients (13 female) had a positive culture of M. asiaticum, many residing around the Tropic of Capricorn. M. asiaticum was responsible for pulmonary disease (n = 2), childhood lymphadenitis (n = 1), olecranon bursitis (n = 1), 6 cases of possible pulmonary disease, and 2 possible wound infections. Chronic lung disease was a risk factor for pulmonary infection, and wounds/lacerations were a risk factor for extrapulmonary disease. Extrapulmonary disease responded to local measures. Pulmonary disease responded to ethambutol-isoniazid-rifampin plus pyrazinamide for the first 2 months in one patient, and amikacin-azithromycin-minocycline in another patient. While M. asiaticum is rare in Queensland, there appears to be an environmental niche. Although often a colonizer, it can be a cause of pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease. Treatment of pulmonary disease remains challenging. Extrapulmonary disease does not mandate specific nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) treatment."

TITLE:Nontuberculous mycobacteria in respiratory samples from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the state of Rondonia, Brazil.
ABSTRACT:The main cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We aimed to evaluate the contribution of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) to pulmonary disease in patients from the state of Rondonia using respiratory samples and epidemiological data from TB cases. Mycobacterium isolates were identified using a combination of conventional tests, polymerase chain reaction-based restriction enzyme analysis of hsp65 gene and hsp65 gene sequencing. Among the 1,812 cases suspected of having pulmonary TB, 444 yielded bacterial cultures, including 369 cases positive for MTB and 75 cases positive for NTM. Within the latter group, 14 species were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium gilvum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium asiaticum, Mycobacterium tusciae, Mycobacterium porcinum, Mycobacterium novocastrense, Mycobacterium simiae, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium holsaticum and 13 isolates could not be identified at the species level. The majority of NTM cases were observed in Porto Velho and the relative frequency of NTM compared with MTB was highest in Ji-Parana. In approximately half of the TB subjects with NTM, a second sample containing NTM was obtained, confirming this as the disease-causing agent. The most frequently observed NTM species were M. abscessus and M. avium and because the former species is resistant to many antibiotics and displays unsatisfactory cure rates, the implementation of rapid identification of mycobacterium species is of considerable importance.

ABSTRACT:A 56-year-old previously healthy female presented with chronic productive cough and fever. Chest X-ray revealed right middle lung opacities. Sputum acid fast bacilli smear was positive, however polymerase chain reaction was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further investigations were pursued, which identified Mycobacterium asiaticum. Appropriate therapy with isoniazid, rifampin and clarithromycin for total 18 months (including pyrazinamide and ethambutol for first 4 months) resulted in clinical and radiographic improvement. Recognition of the possibility of this rarely described pulmonary pathogen is essential for successful treatment.

ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: We describe an immunocompromised patient with Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens bacteremia and coinfection of Mycobacterium bovis pneumonia. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of persistent fever with general malaise. His medical history showed that he had diabetes mellitus (HbA1C 9.2%). A chest computed tomography (CT) showed left upper lung consolidation . Two sets of blood culture at admission finally showed Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens. Moreover, three transbronchoscopy washing specimen cultures revealed Mycobacterium bovis. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The organism Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens was identified using conventional biochemical identification methods, PCR-restriction DNA fragment analysis, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The clinical mycobacterial isolates were identified to the species level by combining Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with an oligonucleotide microarray to detect the M. bovis amplicons. 
CONCLUSION: According to our literature review, our patient's case was the first of a coinfection with Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens and Mycobacterium bovis. Prolonged antibiotic treatment and underlying disease control are necessary for this type of patient.

TITLE:Mycobacterium branderi from both a hand infection and a case of pulmonary disease.
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium branderi, a potential human pathogen first characterized in 1995, has been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. We report here a case in which M. branderi was the only organism isolated upon culture from a hand infection. This isolate, along with a second isolate from a bronchial specimen, was subjected to conventional identification tests for mycobacterial species. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of mycolic acids and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed, and the antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined for both strains. Biochemical tests and the HPLC pattern were consistent with that of M. branderi and M. celatum, which are very similar. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of both strains corresponded to that of M. branderi and enabled us to confidently differentiate this organism from other closely related species such as M. celatum. This contributes to a further understanding of the status of this species as a potential human pathogen as well as illustrating the need for molecular diagnostics as a complementary method for the identification of rare mycobacterial species."

ABSTRACT:The patient was a 56-year-old man, who was found to have a cavitary lesion surrounded by small nodules in the left upper lobe (S(1+2)) on the chest computed tomography (CT) scan prior to surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. Both sputum and bronchial lavage smears for acid-fast bacilli were positive, but a polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex failed to identify the isolates. Mycobacterium species were cultured in 4 weeks. Mycobacterium branderi was identified by determining the nucleic acid sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and RNA polymerase B (rpoB) genes. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for esophageal cancer were started 5 months after the surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. The patient developed fever during the second round of chemotherapy. After chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the wall of the cavitary lesion thickened and a consolidation shadow was noted in the lower portion of the cavitary lesion on the chest CT scan. Combined therapy with clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ethionamide improved the clinical symptoms; further, the abnormal chest shadows disappeared, and the sputum smears and cultures for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Although, currently, there are no recommended therapeutic regimens for pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis caused by M. branderi, combined therapy including the drugs used in this case may have a beneficial effect on this disease.

ABSTRACT:A 67-year-old man with significant smoking history presented with fever, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, productive cough, and progressive dyspnea. Multiple respiratory specimens grew Mycobacterium branderi. Computed tomography scanning of the chest revealed a cavitary right upper lung lesion. Bronchoscopy and thoracoscopic biopsy were negative for malignancy but showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, which was culture negative. Due to clinical and radiologic progression despite therapy with clarithromycin, ethambutol and moxifloxacin, the lesion was surgically resected and the patient's symptoms resolved. Mycobacteria were seen in histopathology but did not grow from resected tissue. The patient received an additional 6 months of medical therapy and remains asymptomatic 1 month after completing antimicrobials. Cases of M. branderi causing human infection are very rarely reported. This is a novel case of multi-drug resistant M. branderi pulmonary infection in an apparently immunocompetent patient, progressive despite medical therapy and requiring surgical resection for definitive management.

TITLE:Fatal Mycobacterium colombiense/cytomegalovirus coinfection associated with acquired immunodeficiency due to autoantibodies against interferon gamma: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Reports of acquired immunodeficiency due to autoantibodies against interferon gamma in the adult population are increasing. The interleukin-12-dependent interferon-gamma axis is a major regulatory pathway of cell-mediated immunity and is critical for protection against a few intracellular organisms, including non-tuberculous mycobacteria and Salmonella spp. We report the first case of a fatal disseminated Mycobacterium colombiense/cytomegalovirus coinfection in an adult woman associated with the acquisition of autoantibodies against interferon-gamma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old woman, born to nonconsanguineous parents in Laos, but who had lived in Canada for the past 30 years, presented with a 1-month history of weight loss, fatigue, cough, and intermittent low-grade fever. A thoracic computed tomography scan revealed an 8 x 7 cm irregular mass impacting the right superior lobar bronchus along with multiple mediastinal and hilar adenopathies. On the fourth day of admission, the patient developed fever with purulent expectorations. Treatment for a post-obstructive bacterial pneumonia was initiated while other investigations were being pursued. Almost every culture performed during the patient's hospitalization was positive for M. colombiense. Given the late presentation of symptoms - at the age of 49 years - and the absence of significant family or personal medical history, we suspected an acquired immunodeficiency due to the presence of anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies. This was confirmed by their detection at high levels in the plasma and a STAT1 phosphorylation assay on human monocytes. The final diagnosis was immunodeficiency secondary to the production of autoantibodies against interferon-gamma, which resulted in a post-obstructive pneumonia and disseminated infection of M. colombiense. The clinical course was complicated by the presence of a multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa post-endobronchial ultrasound mediastinitis, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis with dissemination, and finally, susceptible P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia with septic shock and multiple organ failure, leading to death despite appropriate antibacterial and anti-mycobacterial treatment. 
CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, acquired immunodeficiency syndromes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with severe, persistent, or recurrent infections. Specifically, severe non-tuberculous mycobacteria or Salmonella infections in adults without any other known risk factors may warrant examination of autoantibodies against interferon-gamma because of their increasing recognition in the literature."

TITLE:Respiratory tract isolation of Mycobacterium europaeum following influenza infection in an immunocompromised patient: a case report.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium europaeum, a slow-growing nontuberculous mycobacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium simiae complex, was described after the seminal characterization of five isolates collected from three sputum specimens and a jaw gland biopsy in Italy, Greece and Sweden. Five respiratory tract isolates were further reported in Iran. Here, we report the first isolation of M. europaeum in France, in the respiratory tract of a patient co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Caucasian woman with a 26-year history of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus co-infection was admitted for significant influenza-like syndrome in a context of repetitive exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significant biological parameters included lymphocytes of 1.6G/L including 237/mm3 T4 lymphocytes, a human immunodeficiency virus viral load of 1.6 log and a hepatitis C virus viral load of 6 log. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of her nasopharyngeal aspiration confirmed influenza A H1N1. Three sputum specimens lacked acid-fast bacilli but one grew mycobacteria identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry as M. europaeum with a 1.56 log score. A 1,482-bp 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequence yielded 99% similarity with both Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum ATCC BAA-614 and M. europaeum DSM 45397T and partial rpoB polymerase chain reaction-sequencing yielded a 725-bp sequence exhibiting 100% similarity with M. europaeum strain DSM 45397T. 
CONCLUSIONS: We report the first isolation of M. europaeum in France, in the respiratory tract of a patient co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. M. europaeum warrants further attention in immunosuppressed patients with influenza, using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and rpoB partial sequencing as tools for its accurate identification.

TITLE:Mycobacterium fragae sp. nov., a non-chromogenic species isolated from human respiratory specimens.
ABSTRACT:Three isolates of a slow-growing, non-chromogenic mycobacterium were grown from three sputum samples of a patient from the north-eastern Ceara state in Brazil. Identification at species level could not be obtained with PCR restriction analysis of the hsp65 gene. In order to characterize the isolates we carried out phenotypic and genotypic tests. We sequenced the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene and obtained partial sequences of the hsp65 (encoding the hypervariable region of the 65 kDa heat-shock protein) and rpoB (encoding the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase) genes. The three isolates turned out to be identical and most closely related to the species Mycobacterium celatum and Mycobacterium kyorinense. The results, however, showed significant differences between these species and the isolates studied, which led us to consider them members of a novel species for which we propose the name Mycobacterium fragae. The type strain is HF8705(T) ( = Fiocruz-INCQS/CMRVS P4051(T) = DSM 45731(T))."

TITLE:Mycobacterium haemophilum infections in bone marrow transplant recipients.
ABSTRACT:The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of Mycobacterium haemophilum infection in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation at a cancer center. Bone marrow transplant recipients with M haemophilum infection were identified upon culture of the organism by implementing the organism's unique requirements for growth. This report of the patients' clinical and immunologic course is based on a retrospective chart review. Two distinctly different presentations of M haemophilum infection were observed. Three patients presented with cutaneous lesions, typical of those seen in previous reports of the infection. Two others developed pulmonary disease only. All patients received directed therapy against M haemophilum, but respiratory failure developed in the patients with pneumonia and they died. The remaining 3 patients survived and are free of infection. These are the only reported cases of M haemophilum infection in bone marrow transplant recipients. Early diagnosis obtained through biopsy and special request for culture conditions conducive to the growth of the organism may decrease morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with pulmonary disease."

ABSTRACT:We present a case of a pulmonary nodular lesion in an immunocompetent patient documented at open lung biopsy to be due to Mycobacterium haemophilum. This organism has recently been recognized as a cause of disease in immunocompromised patients, presenting predominantly as skin lesions, arthritis, and rarely pneumonia. Because this mycobacterium is fastidious and difficult to grow without the use of special media and conditions, our case raises the possibility that M. haemophilum could be an underrecognized cause of granulomatous pulmonary lesions and should be considered particularly in cases where smears for acid-fast bacteria are positive but cultures are negative."

TITLE:Increased isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria among TB suspects in Northeastern, Tanzania: public health and diagnostic implications for control programmes.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported worldwide associated with human disease. Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania. 
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection. 
RESULTS: The prevalence of NTM was 9.7% of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P &lt; 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7%), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1%), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5%), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8%) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS. 
CONCLUSION: NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure.

文摘:
背景:非结核分枝杆菌(NTM)在世界范围内与人类疾病相关的报道越来越多。要确定NTM在流行结核(TB)环境中的重要性，需要在可疑患者中区分NTM和结核。正确和及时地发现NTM将影响结核和结核样疾病的治疗和流行病学。本研究旨在确定坦桑尼亚东北部结核疑似病例中NTM的频率和多样性。
方法:在2012年11月至2013年1月间进行横断面研究。从372例结核疑似患者身上采集到744份痰液样本。采用表型、基因型()CM/AS试剂盒、16S rRNA和hsp65基因测序对Hain试剂盒未鉴定的分离株进行检测。采用二元回归模型分析NTM检测的预测因子。
结果:NTM的患病率为9.7%。36例确诊NTM感染的患者中，12例为HIV感染，HIV是NTM检测的显著预测因子(P &lt;0.001)。5例患者并发结核分枝杆菌感染。用CM/AS基因型()鉴定28株NTM分离株，8株不能鉴定。已鉴定的鼠种包括金斑鼠和间斑鼠6(16.7%)、胞内斑鼠4(11.1%)、鸟斑鼠和fortuitum 2(5.5%)、kansasii、lentiflavum、simiae、celatum和marinum 1(2.8%)。在未鉴定到亚种水平的分离株中，通过16S rRNA测序鉴定出kumamotonense(2)、m.s ecellulare /kansasii、m.s intermedium/triplex、m.s acapulcensis/flavescens、m.s stomatepiae、m.s colombiense和m.s terracomplex(1)。此外，hsp65基因测序鉴定出kumamotonense、M. scrofulaceum/M.。avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/ hibernate, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M.。avium和M. kumamotonense/terrae/ hibernniae(1)。结果3株CM/AS分枝杆菌16S rRNA与hsp65基因序列一致，5株不一致。
结论:NTM感染可能在结核病流行环境中引起肺部疾病和影响管理中发挥重要作用。结核分枝杆菌CM/AS基因型()是鉴别临床NTM感染的有用工具。然而，临床分离株的确诊应考虑16S rRNA基因测序。由于NTM诊断的复杂性和不一致性，我们建议通过加强和建立高质量的国家和地区基础设施来集中诊断NTM感染。"

TITLE:Nontuberculous mycobacteria in respiratory samples from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the state of Rondonia, Brazil.
ABSTRACT:The main cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We aimed to evaluate the contribution of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) to pulmonary disease in patients from the state of Rondonia using respiratory samples and epidemiological data from TB cases. Mycobacterium isolates were identified using a combination of conventional tests, polymerase chain reaction-based restriction enzyme analysis of hsp65 gene and hsp65 gene sequencing. Among the 1,812 cases suspected of having pulmonary TB, 444 yielded bacterial cultures, including 369 cases positive for MTB and 75 cases positive for NTM. Within the latter group, 14 species were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium gilvum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium asiaticum, Mycobacterium tusciae, Mycobacterium porcinum, Mycobacterium novocastrense, Mycobacterium simiae, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium holsaticum and 13 isolates could not be identified at the species level. The majority of NTM cases were observed in Porto Velho and the relative frequency of NTM compared with MTB was highest in Ji-Parana. In approximately half of the TB subjects with NTM, a second sample containing NTM was obtained, confirming this as the disease-causing agent. The most frequently observed NTM species were M. abscessus and M. avium and because the former species is resistant to many antibiotics and displays unsatisfactory cure rates, the implementation of rapid identification of mycobacterium species is of considerable importance.

TITLE:Mycobacterium intermedium sp. nov.
ABSTRACT:Strains of a new type of slowly growing mycobacterium were repeatedly isolated from sputum from a patient with pulmonary disease. This photochromogenic organism grew at 22, 31, 37, and 41 degrees C, possessed catalase, acid phosphatase, esterase, beta-galactosidase, and arylsulfatase activities, and hydrolyzed Tween. It did not produce nicotinic acid or have nitrate reductase, acetamidase, benzamidase, isonicotinamidase, nicotinamidase, pyrazinamidase, succinidamidase, and acid phosphatase activities. Urease activity was variable. The organism is susceptible to ethambutol and resistant to isoniazid and streptomycin. A mycolic acid analysis revealed the presence of alpha-mycolates, alpha'-mycolates, and keto-mycolates. The results of comparative 16S rRNA sequencing placed this organism at an intermediate position between the rapidly and slowly growing mycobacteria. On the basis of the pattern of enzymatic activities and metabolic properties, the results of fatty acid analyses, and the unique 16S rRNA sequence, we propose that this organism represents a new species, for which we propose the name Mycobacterium intermedium. The type strain is strain 1669/91; a culture of this strain has been deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen as strain DSM 44049."

TITLE:Nontuberculous mycobacteria isolated from pulmonary specimens between 2004 and 2009: causative agent or not?
ABSTRACT:Nontuberculous mycobacteria were identified from 45891 samples of 19553 patients with a prediagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis between November 2004 and January 2009. Among 10041 (21.9%) culture positive samples, 208 (2.1%) pulmonary samples recovered from 77 individual patients were differentiated as mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT). Proportion of mycobacteria evaluated as causative agent for clinical infection were found as 0.16% (n = 31), mostly M. avium complex, M. abscessus and M. kansasii. Additionally, M. fortuitum-peregrinum complex, M. simiae, M. szulgai / intermedium and M. scrofulaceum were found as causative agent in 2, 2, 2 and 1 patient, respectively. Identification of infections caused by environmental or opportunistic pathogen mycobacteria is required in rapid and accurate diagnosis, infection control and treatment planning of infections caused by M. tuberculosis complex and/or MOTT."

TITLE:Increased isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria among TB suspects in Northeastern, Tanzania: public health and diagnostic implications for control programmes.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported worldwide associated with human disease. Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania. 
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection. 
RESULTS: The prevalence of NTM was 9.7% of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P &lt; 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7%), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1%), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5%), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8%) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS. 
CONCLUSION: NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure.

TITLE:Distribution and clinical significance of Mycobacterium avium complex species isolated from respiratory specimens.
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was originally composed of 2 species, M. avium and M. intracellulare. However, several new species closely related to M. intracellulare have recently been identified. In addition, M. avium has been further subdivided into 4 subspecies. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of different MAC species recovered from respiratory specimens and to elucidate the clinical relevance of these species. Clinical isolates, from 219 patients, that had been initially identified as M. avium or M. intracellulare by non-sequencing methods were reidentified using multilocus sequence typing, and the clinical significance of the identified species was then investigated. Of 91 isolates originally identified as M. intracellulare, 75 (82%) were confirmed to be M. intracellulare, 8 (9%) isolates were identified as M. chimaera, and 4 (4%) isolates each were identified as ""M. indicus pranii"" and M. yongonense. The 128 isolates originally designated as M. avium were determined to be M. avium subsp. hominissuis. Of the 219 patients, 146 (67%) met the diagnostic criteria for MAC lung disease, and for each MAC species, the proportion of patients meeting these criteria was as follows: M. intracellulare (54/75, 72%), M. chimaera (3/8, 38%), ""M. indicus pranii"" (3/4, 75%), M. yongonense (2/4, 50%), and M. avium subsp. hominissuis (84/128, 66%). In summary, multilocus sequence typing of respiratory isolates initially identified as MAC revealed that, although most isolates were M. avium subsp. hominissuis or M. intracellulare, approximately 7% were newer MAC members, with clinical evidence supporting their potential pathogenicity for humans.

题目:呼吸标本分离的鸟分枝杆菌复合种的分布及其临床意义。
摘要/ ABSTRACT摘要:鸟分枝杆菌复合物(Mycobacterium avium complex, MAC)最初由鸟分枝杆菌和胞内分枝杆菌两种分枝杆菌组成。然而，最近发现了几个与胞内支原体密切相关的新物种。此外，还将其进一步划分为4个亚种。本研究的目的是确定从呼吸标本中恢复的不同MAC物种的比例，并阐明这些物种的临床相关性。对219例经非测序方法初步鉴定为鸟型或细胞内型M.的临床分离株进行多位点序列分型，并对鉴定种的临床意义进行调查。91株原鉴定为胞内分枝杆菌的分离株中，75株(82%)被证实为胞内分枝杆菌，8株(9%)被鉴定为嵌合体分枝杆菌，4株(4%)被鉴定为pranii分枝杆菌和yongonense分枝杆菌。128株原命名为禽分枝杆菌的分离株经鉴定为禽分枝杆菌亚种。hominissuis。的219患者中,146例(67%)符合MAC肺部疾病的诊断标准,和为每一个MAC物种,是满足所有这些条件的患者的比例如下:m . intracellulare (54/75, 72%), m .嵌合体(3/8,38%)、“m . indicus pranii”(3/4,75%),m . yongonense(2/4, 50%)和m . avium无性系种群。hominissuis(84/128, 66%)。综上所述，初步鉴定为MAC的呼吸道分离株的多位点序列分型结果表明，虽然大多数分离株是禽m.a iumsubsp。hominissuis或M.胞内菌，大约7%是新的MAC成员，临床证据支持它们对人类的潜在致病性。"

TITLE:Emergence of Rare Species of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria as Potential Pathogens in Saudi Arabian Clinical Setting.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Clinical relevance of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is increasing worldwide including in Saudi Arabia. A high species diversity of NTM's has been noticed in a recent study. However, the identification in diagnostic laboratories is mostly limited to common species. The impact of NTM species diversity on clinical outcome is so far neglected in most of the clinical settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS: During April 2014 to September 2015, a nationwide collection of suspected NTM clinical isolates with clinical and demographical data were carried out. Primary identification was performed by commercial line probe assays. Isolates identified up to Mycobacterium species level by line probe assays only were included and subjected to sequencing of 16S rRNA, rpoB, hsp65 and 16S-23S ITS region genes. The sequence data were subjected to BLAST analysis in GenBank and Ez-Taxon databases. Male Saudi nationals were dominated in the study population and falling majorly into the 46-59 years age group. Pulmonary cases were 59.3% with a surprising clinical relevance of 75% based on American Thoracic Society guidelines. Among the 40.7% extra-pulmonary cases, 50% of them were skin infections. The identification revealed 16 species and all of them are reporting for the first time in Saudi Arabia. The major species obtained were Mycobacterium monascence (18.5%), M. cosmeticum (11.1%), M. kubicae (11.1%), M. duvalli (7.4%), M.terrae (7.4%) and M. triplex (7.4%). This is the first report on clinical relevance of M. kubicae, M. tusciae, M.yongonense, M. arupense and M.iranicum causing pulmonary disease and M. monascence, M. duvalli, M. perigrinum, M. insubricum, M. holsaticum and M. kyorinense causing various extra-pulmonary diseases in Saudi Arabia. Ascites caused by M. monascence and cecum infection by M. holsaticum were the rarest incidents. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To the first time in the country, clinical significance of various rare NTM's are well explored and the finding warrants a new threat to the Saudi Arabian clinical settings.

TITLE:Burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases in Saudi Arabian children: The first nationwide experience.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases are increasing worldwide. A large paucity of data related to pediatric NTM diseases exists globally and particularly in Saudi Arabia. 
METHODS: The first nationwide exploratory study on existence of NTM diseases among Saudi Arabian children (0-14 years old) has been carried out during 2016-2017. Suspected NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data were enrolled from regional reference laboratories. Species level identification of isolates was carried out by commercial line probe assays and gene sequencing. 
RESULTS: In 12 months, 52 culture positive cases with 44(84.6%) confirmed disease incidences were identified. Demographically, Saudi nationals (86.5%) were dominated and 77.3% cases have different comorbid conditions. Lymphadenitis (40.4%) followed by 26.9% of pulmonary cases with 42.8% of confirmed clinical relevance were mainly reported. Species identification showed Mycobacterium simiae (31.8%), M. abscessus (23.1%) and nine other species including rarely encountering M. riyadhense. Ascites caused by M. monacense, pulmonary disease caused by M. riyadhense and M. monacense were rarest clinical events and reported for the first time globally in a pediatric cohort. 
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse NTM diseases even in immunocompetent children are an upcoming challenge in Saudi Arabia. Lack of awareness on NTM disease must be addressed with immediate development of management plans.

TITLE:Intraspecies plasmid and genomic variation of Mycobacterium kubicae revealed by the complete genome sequences of two clinical isolates.
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium kubicae is 1 of nearly 200 species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), environmental micro-organisms that in some situations can infect humans and cause severe lung, skin and soft tissue infections. Although numerous studies have investigated the genetic variation among prevalent clinical NTM species, including Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium, many of the less common but clinically relevant NTM species, including M. kubicae, still lack complete genomes to serve as a comparative reference. Well-characterized representative genomes for each NTM species are important both for investigating the pathogenic potential of NTM, as well as for use in diagnostic methods, even for species that less frequently cause human disease. Here, we report the complete genomes of two M. kubicae strains, isolated from two unrelated patients. Hybrid short-read and long-read sequencing and assembly, using sequence reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms, were utilized to resolve the chromosome and plasmid sequences of each isolate. The genome of NJH_MKUB1 had 5135 coding sequences (CDSs), a circular chromosome of length 5.3 Mb and two plasmids. The genome of NJH_MKUB2 had 5957 CDSs, a circular chromosome of 6.0 Mb and five plasmids. We compared our completed genomic assemblies to four recently released draft genomes of M. kubicae in order to better understand intraspecies genomic conservation and variability. We also identified genes implicated in drug resistance, virulence and persistence in the M. kubicae chromosome and plasmids. Virulence factors encoded in the genome and in the plasmids of M. kubicae provide a foundation for investigating how opportunistic environmental NTM may cause disease.

标题:两个临床分离株的全基因组序列揭示库比科分枝杆菌种内质粒和基因组变异。
摘要库比科分枝杆菌是近200种非结核分枝杆菌(NTM)中的1种，在某些情况下可感染人类并引起严重的肺部、皮肤和软组织感染。尽管已有大量研究调查了临床流行的NTM菌种(包括脓肿分枝杆菌和鸟分枝杆菌)之间的遗传变异，但许多不常见但临床相关的NTM菌种(包括库比科分枝杆菌)仍缺乏完整的基因组作为比较参考。每个NTM物种的特征明确的代表性基因组对于研究NTM的致病潜力以及诊断方法的使用都很重要，即使对于不经常引起人类疾病的物种也是如此。在这里，我们报告了两株库比凯分枝杆菌的完整基因组，它们是从两个不相关的病人身上分离出来的。利用Illumina和Oxford Nanopore技术平台上的序列片段进行杂交短读和长读测序和组装，对每个分离物的染色体和质粒序列进行解析。NJH_MKUB1的基因组有5135个编码序列(CDSs)，一个5.3 Mb长的圆形染色体和两个质粒。NJH_MKUB2基因组有5957个CDSs，一个6.0 Mb的圆形染色体和5个质粒。为了更好地理解种内基因组的保存和变异，我们将我们完成的基因组组合与最近发布的4个库比凯分枝杆菌基因组草案进行了比较。我们还鉴定了在库比凯分枝杆菌染色体和质粒中涉及耐药性、毒力和持久性的基因。库比凯分枝杆菌基因组和质粒中编码的毒力因子为研究机会性环境NTM如何致病提供了基础。"

TITLE:Increased isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria among TB suspects in Northeastern, Tanzania: public health and diagnostic implications for control programmes.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported worldwide associated with human disease. Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania. 
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection. 
RESULTS: The prevalence of NTM was 9.7% of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P &lt; 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7%), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1%), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5%), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8%) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS. 
CONCLUSION: NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType( ) Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure.

标题:坦桑尼亚东北部地区结核疑似病例中对非结核分枝杆菌的进一步隔离:对控制规划的公共卫生和诊断影响。
文摘:
背景:非结核分枝杆菌(NTM)在世界范围内与人类疾病相关的报道越来越多。要确定NTM在流行结核(TB)环境中的重要性，需要在可疑患者中区分NTM和结核。正确和及时地发现NTM将影响结核和结核样疾病的治疗和流行病学。本研究旨在确定坦桑尼亚东北部结核疑似病例中NTM的频率和多样性。
方法:在2012年11月至2013年1月间进行横断面研究。从372例结核疑似患者身上采集到744份痰液样本。采用表型、基因型()CM/AS试剂盒、16S rRNA和hsp65基因测序对Hain试剂盒未鉴定的分离株进行检测。采用二元回归模型分析NTM检测的预测因子。
结果:NTM的患病率为9.7%。36例确诊NTM感染的患者中，12例为HIV感染，HIV是NTM检测的显著预测因子(P &lt;0.001)。5例患者并发结核分枝杆菌感染。用CM/AS基因型()鉴定28株NTM分离株，8株不能鉴定。已鉴定的鼠种包括金斑鼠和间斑鼠6(16.7%)、胞内斑鼠4(11.1%)、鸟斑鼠和fortuitum 2(5.5%)、kansasii、lentiflavum、simiae、celatum和marinum 1(2.8%)。在未鉴定到亚种水平的分离株中，通过16S rRNA测序鉴定出kumamotonense(2)、m.s ecellulare /kansasii、m.s intermedium/triplex、m.s acapulcensis/flavescens、m.s stomatepiae、m.s colombiense和m.s terracomplex(1)。此外，hsp65基因测序鉴定出kumamotonense、M. scrofulaceum/M.。avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/ hibernate, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M.。avium和M. kumamotonense/terrae/ hibernniae(1)。结果3株CM/AS分枝杆菌16S rRNA与hsp65基因序列一致，5株不一致。
结论:NTM感染可能在结核病流行环境中引起肺部疾病和影响管理中发挥重要作用。结核分枝杆菌CM/AS基因型()是鉴别临床NTM感染的有用工具。然而，临床分离株的确诊应考虑16S rRNA基因测序。由于NTM诊断的复杂性和不一致性，我们建议通过加强和建立高质量的国家和地区基础设施来集中诊断NTM感染。"

ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium kumamotonense is a novel, slow-growing non-chromogenic nontuberculous mycobacterium, which belongs to Mycobacterium terrae complex. We report, for the first time in Greece, the isolation of M. kumamotonense from an immunocompetent patient with pulmonary infection and latent tuberculosis. M. kumamotonense was identified by sequencing analysis of 16S rDNA and 65-kDa heat shock protein genes while by commercial molecular assays it was misidentified as Mycobacterium celatum. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method. The strain was susceptible to amikacin, clarithromycin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifabutin, ethambutol and linezolid.

ABSTRACT:An 85-year-old man with dementia first visited our hospital 5 years ago, complaining of hemoptysis. He was hospitalized 2 years later owing to fever, cough, and dyspnea. A chest computed tomography scan showed infiltration with a cavity in the left upper lobe. He was diagnosed with nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infection on the basis of the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum and repeated bronchoalveolar lavage specimens; however, we were unable to identify the isolate by DNA-DNA hybridization. Although his general condition had slightly improved after treatment initiation, intermittent chemotherapy owing to the adverse effects of the drugs and dementia led to rapid disease progression and death. After his death, the isolated mycobacterium was identified as Mycobacterium kyorinense by sequence analysis of the hsp 65 and rpoB genes."

TITLE:Pulmonary Mycobacterium kyorinense disease: A case report and review of literature.
ABSTRACT:We report here the first case of pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium kyorinense in a 55-year-old hypertensive woman treated for pulmonary tuberculosis earlier on two occasions. She presented with productive cough, intermittent episode of left-sided chest pain, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, and breathlessness. Sputum cultures revealed non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). She remained persistently symptomatic with sputum cultures positive for acid-fast bacilli even after 6 months of treatment. Hence, a 16SrRNA gene amplification and sequencing were done that revealed M. kyorinense. Based on the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society, she was started on weight-based dosing of clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ethambutol, isoniazid and injection amikacin daily. The patient improved symptomatically and became culture-negative after 3 months of therapy with the above regimen and continued to be culture negative for 12 months of treatment. She continues to remain symptom-free without evidence of any clinical or bacteriological relapse.

TITLE:Profile of patients with pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease mimicking pulmonary tuberculosis.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: With the introduction of newer molecular diagnostic tools, an increasing number of Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) affecting the respiratory system and mimicking symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are being identified. They may be misdiagnosed and treated as PTB, often categorized as treatment failures if they do not respond to treatment. This manuscript aims to characterize patients with pulmonary NTM disease. 
METHODS: Patient characteristics of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary NTM disease, attending the ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai were prospectively compiled over a two-year period (2017-2018). 
RESULTS: A total of 122 patients with recurrent chest symptoms and not responding to anti-tuberculosis treatment were screened for NTM. Thirty-nine cases (26 males and 13 females) of symptomatic pulmonary NTM were diagnosed. The mean (SD) patient age and body mass index were 48.6 +- 11 years and 16.3 +- 3. All male participants were smokers, had at least one episode of previous ATT. Mycobacterium kansasii (48.7%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by Mycobacterium intracellulare (20.5%), Mycobacterium abscessus (7.6%) followed by Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kyorinense, and Mycobacterium simiae. Infection with multiple NTMs was seen in four patients. Isoniazid resistance was identified in 20 patients. Based on species identified, treatment was initiated as per American Thoracic Society guidelines and continued up to 12 months of culture negativity. 
CONCLUSIONS: M. kansasii is the commonest pulmonary NTM isolated in Tamilnadu with a higher prevalence in males and elderly. Sensitization of both patients and providers is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis of pulmonary NTM disease as pulmonary TB.

TITLE:[A case of lung infection complicated by pneumothorax caused by Mycobacterium marinum].
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium marinum is a waterborne mycobacterium that commonly infects fish and amphibians worldwide, but transmission to humans can occasionally occur, typically as a granulomatous skin infection following minor hand trauma. Infection involving the lungs is very rare. We herein describe a case of M. marinum-associated pneumonia and pneumothorax. In August 2008, an 81-year-old man was admitted to a hospital for detailed examination of weight loss and an abnormal shadow on chest imaging. Based on a sputum test, nontuberculous mycobacteriosis caused by M. marinum was diagnosed. At that time, the blood chemistry revealed no respiratory symptoms or inflammatory findings, and the patient was treated on an outpatient basis with erythromycin and an expectorant. In late November 2008, sputum and coughing were observed. Furthermore, the patient developed a fever and chest pain that increased while breathing and he visited the emergency outpatient unit of our hospital on December 1. Hypoxemia, bilateral pneumonia, and right pneumothorax were observed, and a chest tube was inserted into the right thoracic cavity. Results of an acid-fast bacteria smear from the sputum and pleural effusion were positive, and M. marinum was identified on culture. The patient was diagnosed as having a lung infection complicated by pneumothorax caused by M. marinum. The lung infection was ameliorated with clarithromycin, rifampicin and ethambutol. However, no decreased in the air leaking from the chest tube was noted and inflation of the lung was incomplete. The department of respiratory surgery therefore performed thoracoplasty and lung cerclage. Subsequently, the air leak subsided, allowing removal of the chest tube and the patient was discharged."

TITLE:Multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacteria isolated from cystic fibrosis patients.
ABSTRACT:Worldwide, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have become emergent pathogens of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 5 to 20%. This work investigated the presence of NTM in sputum samples of 129 CF patients (2 to 18 years old) submitted to longitudinal clinical supervision at a regional reference center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June 2009 to March 2012, 36 NTM isolates recovered from 10 (7.75%) out of 129 children were obtained. Molecular identification of NTM was performed by using PCR restriction analysis targeting the hsp65 gene (PRA-hsp65) and sequencing of the rpoB gene, and susceptibility tests were performed that followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. For evaluating the genotypic diversity, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and/or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) was performed. The species identified were Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii (n = 24), M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (n = 6), Mycobacterium fortuitum (n = 3), Mycobacterium marseillense (n = 2), and Mycobacterium timonense (n = 1). Most of the isolates presented resistance to five or more of the antimicrobials tested. Typing profiles were mainly patient specific. The PFGE profiles indicated the presence of two clonal groups for M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and five clonal groups for M. abscesssus subsp. bolletii, with just one clone detected in two patients. Given the observed multidrug resistance patterns and the possibility of transmission between patients, we suggest the implementation of continuous and routine investigation of NTM infection or colonization in CF patients, including countries with a high burden of tuberculosis disease.

TITLE:Burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases in Saudi Arabian children: The first nationwide experience.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases are increasing worldwide. A large paucity of data related to pediatric NTM diseases exists globally and particularly in Saudi Arabia. 
METHODS: The first nationwide exploratory study on existence of NTM diseases among Saudi Arabian children (0-14 years old) has been carried out during 2016-2017. Suspected NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data were enrolled from regional reference laboratories. Species level identification of isolates was carried out by commercial line probe assays and gene sequencing. 
RESULTS: In 12 months, 52 culture positive cases with 44(84.6%) confirmed disease incidences were identified. Demographically, Saudi nationals (86.5%) were dominated and 77.3% cases have different comorbid conditions. Lymphadenitis (40.4%) followed by 26.9% of pulmonary cases with 42.8% of confirmed clinical relevance were mainly reported. Species identification showed Mycobacterium simiae (31.8%), M. abscessus (23.1%) and nine other species including rarely encountering M. riyadhense. Ascites caused by M. monacense, pulmonary disease caused by M. riyadhense and M. monacense were rarest clinical events and reported for the first time globally in a pediatric cohort. 
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse NTM diseases even in immunocompetent children are an upcoming challenge in Saudi Arabia. Lack of awareness on NTM disease must be addressed with immediate development of management plans.

TITLE:Mycobacterium nebraskense sp. nov., a novel slowly growing scotochromogenic species.
ABSTRACT:The characterization of a novel slowly growing, scotochromogenic Mycobacterium species is reported. This previously undescribed mycobacterial species was isolated from five different patients with symptomatic pulmonary infections. All isolates were acid-fast-positive and the mycolic acid profiles were unique and supported placement into the genus Mycobacterium. Phenotypic characteristics of each strain included optimal growth after 3 weeks at a temperature range of 30-35 degrees C, yellow pigmentation after incubation in the dark and production of a heat-stable catalase. The 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences were identical for all five strains, but distinct from all known mycobacterial species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the novel species within the slowly growing mycobacteria group in close proximity to Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. These data support the conclusion that the related five described organisms represent a novel Mycobacterium species, for which the name Mycobacterium nebraskense sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain UNMC-MY1349(T) (=ATCC BAA-837(T)=DSM 44803(T))."

ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium nebraskense is a scotochromogenic mycobacterium first isolated from sputum samples of five patients at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. M. nebraskense was first identified as a pathogen in an immunocompetent host, also in Nebraska. In this case report, we describe a patient with nodular pulmonary disease most likely due to M. nebraskense, who was successfully treated with rifampin and azithromycin, representing the first case in which this organism was a pathogen outside of Nebraska and the first description of successful treatment of this infection."

TITLE:Rare case of Mycobacterium nebraskense presenting as asymptomatic cavitary lung lesion.
ABSTRACT:Introduction: Mycobacterium Nebraskense is a rare nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The first isolate of the species was from human sputum at University of Nebraska Medical Center. There are only a few cases have been reported and the exact behavior of the disease is not clearly described. Here, we present a case from New York City incidentally found to have a cavitary lung lesion due to M. nebraskense.Case report: An 82-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dementia presented with constipation and urinary retention for 1 day. She had no fever, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, appetite change, or weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis revealed retained fecal material in the colon, non-obstructing left renal calculus, and bilateral small pleural effusion with right-sided lung infiltrates. Subsequent CT scan of the chest showed 4.5 cm pleural-based opacity in right lung base with a small cavity. Sputum smear for Acid-fast bacilli was positive. Mycobacterial culture reported positive growth of M. nebraskense, while polymerase chain reaction returned negative for Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. With the patient asymptomatic and her constipation improved, she was discharged with plans for close follow-up as outpatient. Conclusion: M. nebraskense is a very rare nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. From only a few cases reported in the USA, the exact presentation of infection, disease progression, and treatment have not been described well. Asymptomatic cavitary lung disease caused by M. nebraskense has not been reported before.

TITLE:Reconsidering Mycobacterium bovis as a proxy for zoonotic tuberculosis: a molecular epidemiological surveillance study.
ABSTRACT:Background: Zoonotic tuberculosis is defined as human infection with Mycobacterium bovis. Although globally, India has the largest number of human tuberculosis cases and the largest cattle population, in which bovine tuberculosis is endemic, the burden of zoonotic tuberculosis is unknown. The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of the human prevalence of animal-associated members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) at a large referral hospital in India. Methods: We did a molecular epidemiological surveillance study of 940 positive mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) cultures, collected from patients visiting the outpatient department at Christian Medical College (Vellore, India) with suspected tuberculosis between Oct 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. A PCR-based approach was applied to subspeciate cultures. Isolates identified as MTBC other than M tuberculosis or as inconclusive on PCR were subject to whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenetically compared with publicly available MTBC sequences from south Asia. Sequences from WGS were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive, accession number SRP226525 (BioProject database number PRJNA575883). Findings: The 940 MGIT cultures were from 548 pulmonary and 392 extrapulmonary samples. A conclusive identification was obtained for all 940 isolates; wild-type M bovis was not identified. The isolates consisted of M tuberculosis (913 [97 1%] isolates), Mycobacterium orygis (seven [0 7%]), M bovis BCG (five [0 5%]), and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (15 [1 6%]). Subspecies were assigned for 25 isolates by WGS, which were analysed against 715 MTBC sequences from south Asia. Among the 715 genomes, no M bovis was identified. Four isolates of cattle origin were dispersed among human sequences within M tuberculosis lineage 1, and the seven M orygis isolates from human MGIT cultures were dispersed among sequences from cattle. Interpretation: M bovis prevalence in humans is an inadequate proxy of zoonotic tuberculosis. The recovery of M orygis from humans highlights the need to use a broadened definition, including MTBC subspecies such as M orygis, to investigate zoonotic tuberculosis. The identification of M tuberculosis in cattle also reinforces the need for One Health investigations in countries with endemic bovine tuberculosis.

题目:重新考虑牛分枝杆菌作为人畜共患结核病的代理:分子流行病学监测研究。
摘要:背景:人畜共患结核病的定义是人类感染牛分枝杆菌。尽管在全球范围内，印度拥有最多的人类结核病病例和最多的牛的人口，牛结核病在印度是流行的，但人畜共患结核病的负担是未知的。这项研究的目的是获得印度一家大型转诊医院动物相关成员结核分枝杆菌复合体(MTBC)的人类流行率估计数。方法:对2018年10月1日至2019年3月31日在印度维洛尔基督教医学院(Christian Medical College, Vellore, India)门诊部就诊的疑似结核患者的940例分枝杆菌生长指示试管(MGIT)阳性培养物进行分子流行病学监测研究。以pcr为基础的方法应用于亚种培养。经鉴定为MTBC而非M型结核或PCR检测不确定的分离物进行全基因组测序(WGS)，并与公开获得的来自南亚的MTBC序列进行系统进化比较。WGS序列存储在国家生物技术信息中心序列读取库，登录号SRP226525(生物工程数据库号PRJNA575883)。结果:940例MGIT培养来自548例肺标本和392例肺外标本。对所有940株菌株进行了结论性鉴定;未发现野生型牛M。分离株包括结核分枝杆菌913株(97 1%)、米结核分枝杆菌7株(0 7%)、牛结核分枝杆菌5株(0 5%)和非结核分枝杆菌15株(1 6%)。用WGS对25个分离株进行了亚种划分，并与来自南亚的715个MTBC序列进行了分析。在715个基因组中，没有发现M牛。4株牛源分离株分布在M结核细胞系1的人类序列中，7株人MGIT培养株M orygis分布在牛源序列中。解释:人体内牛结核分枝杆菌的流行程度不足以代替人畜共患结核病。从人类身上发现的M - orygis突出表明，需要使用更广泛的定义，包括M - orygis等MTBC亚种，以调查人畜共患结核病。在牛身上发现M型结核也加强了在牛结核流行国家进行一次卫生调查的必要性。资助:比尔和梅林达·盖茨基金会、加拿大卫生研究所。"

TITLE:Failure to recognize nontuberculous mycobacteria leads to misdiagnosis of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections cause morbidity worldwide. They are difficult to diagnose in resource-limited regions, and most patients receive empiric treatment for tuberculosis (TB). Our objective here is to evaluate the potential impact of NTM diseases among patients treated presumptively for tuberculosis in Mali. 
METHODS: We re-evaluated sputum specimens among patients newly diagnosed with TB (naive) and those previously treated for TB disease (chronic cases). Sputum microscopy, culture and Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing were performed. Identification of strains was performed using molecular probes or sequencing of secA1 and/or 16S rRNA genes. 
RESULTS: Of 142 patients enrolled, 61 (43%) were clinically classified as chronic cases and 17 (12%) were infected with NTM. Eleven of the 142 (8%) patients had NTM disease alone (8 M. avium, 2 M. simiae and 1 M. palustre). All these 11 were from the chronic TB group, comprising 11/61 (18%) of that group and all were identified as candidates for second line treatment. The remaining 6/17 (35.30%) NTM infected patients had coinfection with M. tuberculosis and all 6 were from the TB treatment naive group. These 6 were candidates for the standard first line treatment regimen of TB. M. avium was identified in 11 of the 142 (8%) patients, only 3/11 (27.27%) of whom were HIV positive. 
CONCLUSIONS: NTM infections should be considered a cause of morbidity in TB endemic environments especially when managing chronic TB cases to limit morbidity and provide appropriate treatment."

TITLE:Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum sp. nov., novel slowly growing, scotochromogenic clinical isolates related to Mycobacterium simiae.
ABSTRACT:A group of pigmented, slowly growing mycobacteria identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as 'MCRO 33' (GenBank accession no. AF152559) have been isolated from several clinical specimens in various laboratories across Canada. Genotypically, the organism is most closely related to Mycobacterium simiae. However, it presents with a similar phenotypic profile to Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. Several reference strains obtained from ATCC and TMC culture collections, previously identified as M. scrofulaceum or M. simiae, have also been found to possess the MCRO 33 16S rRNA gene sequence. Biochemical testing, susceptibility testing, HPLC, hsp65 gene and 16S-23S spacer (ITS1) sequencing were performed on clinical and reference strains to characterize further this unique species. Of the clinical strains, one was isolated from a cervix biopsy whereas all other clinical isolates were obtained from respiratory samples. In one patient, symptoms, imaging and repeat clinical specimens positive on culture for this organism were suggestive of active clinical disease. The description of this species, for which the name Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum sp. nov. is proposed, follows the present trend of a large number of novel Mycobacterium species identified due in great part to sequence-based methods. The type strain is HSC68T (= ATCC BAA-614T = DSM 44648T)."

ABSTRACT:Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-infected patients who have started highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is well known to be one scenario of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We encountered the first case in Japan of an HIV-infected patient with pulmonary Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum infection as IRIS. A 34 year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Lymphadenopathy was observed at the left pulmonary hilum. IRIS was suspected and thoracoscopic surgery was performed to diagnose the cause of lymphadenopathy. Granulomas were observed histologically, and M. parascrofulaceum was cultured. This organism was susceptible to Clarithromycin, rifampicin and levofloxacin. After the operation and without treatment, recurrence of M. parascrofulaceum infection was not observed. M. parascrofulaceum was isolated from several clinical specimens for the first time in 2004. To date, only five cases have been reported."

TITLE:Immunopathological characteristics of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome caused by Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum infection in a patient with AIDS.
ABSTRACT:Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) caused by mycobacterium in patients with AIDS is often experienced in clinical practice. There is, however, a paucity of data documenting the histopathological findings and the pathogenesis. We determined the immunopathological characteristics of IRIS associated with Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum infection in an AIDS patient. A patient presented with pulmonary lymphadenitis and involvement of the pulmonary lingular segment. Portions of the involved lymph nodes and lung were excised, and the immunological properties were analyzed by immunohistochemical assays. The histological characteristics of lymph nodes showed a caseous necrosis. Histopathologically, the pulmonary lesion was composed of exudative and proliferative lesions. CD4(+), CD8(+), CD57(+), and CD25(+)/FoxP3(+) cells were observed in both types of lesions. Clusters of CD20(+) cells and GATA3(+) cells were predominantly observed in exudative lesions, while T-bet(+) cells were dominant in proliferative lesions. ROR-gamma(+) cells were also observed in exudative lesions. These results indicate that the cellular immunity to mycobacteria was recovering in the lung tissue. In M. parascrofulaceum pulmonary infection, the exudative lesion had characteristics of Th2 and Th17-type immunities. In contrast, the proliferative lesion had characteristics of Th-1 type immunity. Our data provide the first evidence to reveal the status of the axis of distinctive immunity in the process of granuloma formation caused by a mycobacterium-related infection."

TITLE:Bacteriological characterization of a Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum strain isolated from a Chinese pneumonia patient.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: A Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum strain was isolated from a pneumonia patient-the first such reported case from China. The bacteriological characteristics of the strain were determined. 
METHODS: Species identification was performed by homologue gene sequence comparison, then a series of biochemical tests was conducted to elucidate the bacteriological characteristics. Drug susceptibility and pathogenicity to mice of the strain were tested. 
RESULTS: The clinical M. parascrofulaceum strain presented a very similar phenotypic profile to that of Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. The M. parascrofulaceum strain was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin in vitro. At week 2 post-infection, the lung tissues of mice demonstrated a local inflammatory response denoted by peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates. At weeks 4 and 8, the lung tissues showed peri-bronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates with large aggregates of lymphocytes and part of the tissue showed granulomatous lesions; there was no appreciable necrosis. The colony-forming units (CFU) count of infected lung and spleen increased gradually during the 8 weeks of the experiment. 
CONCLUSIONS: The M. parascrofulaceum strain isolated in China was sensitive to rifabutin, rifapentine, clarithromycin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, and moxifloxacin. The mycobacteria were capable of proliferating in mice and could lead to pathological changes in the lungs of the mice."

ABSTRACT:A 67-year-old man with a pulmonary cavity was admitted to our hospital. Mycobacterial culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample obtained from the right upper pulmonary lesion tested positive for mycobacterium, and sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, hsp65, and rpoB revealed that the cultured mycobacterium was Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum. Treatment with antimycobacterial agents was ineffective, and repeated culturing of bronchoscopic specimens revealed that the specimens were positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Combination treatment of antimycobacterial agents and voriconazole improved the lung lesion. This is the first report of a patient with pulmonary M. parascrofulaceum infection complicated with chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis.

TITLE:Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis of the Latin American Mediterranean Lineage, Wrongly Identified as Mycobacterium pinnipedii (Spoligotype International Type 863 [SIT863]), Causing Active Tuberculosis in South Brazil.
ABSTRACT:We recently detected the spoligotype patterns of strains of Mycobacterium pinnipedii, a species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, in sputum samples from nine cases with pulmonary tuberculosis residing in Porto Alegre, South Brazil. Because this species is rarely encountered in humans, we further characterized these nine isolates by additional genotyping techniques, including 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing, verification of the loci TbD1, RD9, pks15/1, RD(Rio), and fbpC, the insertion of IS6110 at a site specific to the M. tuberculosis Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) lineage, and whole-genome sequencing. The combined analysis of these markers revealed that the isolates are in fact M. tuberculosis and more specifically belong to the LAM genotype. Most of these isolates (n8) were shown to be multidrug resistant (MDR), which prompted us to perform partial sequencing of the rpoA, rpoB, rpoC, katG, and inhA genes. Seven isolates (77.8%) carried the S315T mutation in katG, and one of these (11%) also presented the C((-17)T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in inhA. Interestingly, six of the MDR isolates also presented an undescribed insertion of 12 nucleotides (CCA GAA CAA CCC) in codon 516 of rpoB. No putative compensatory mutation was found in either rpoA or rpoC. This is the first report of an M. tuberculosis LAM family strain with a convergent M. pinnipedii spoligotype. These spoligotypes are observed in genotype databases at a modest frequency, highlighting that care must be taken when identifying isolates in the M. tuberculosis complex on the basis of single genetic markers.

标题:拉丁美洲地中海血统的耐多药结核分枝杆菌，错误地被鉴定为pinnipedii分枝杆菌(Spoligotype International Type 863 [SIT863])，导致巴西南部活动性肺结核。
摘要/ ABSTRACT摘要:我们最近在巴西南部阿雷格里港9例肺结核患者的痰标本中检测到了pinnipedii分枝杆菌的spoligotype型。因为在人类这个物种很少遇到,我们进一步表征这些九隔离通过额外的基因分型技术,包括24-locus分枝杆菌点缀repetitive-unit-variable-number串联重复序列(MIRU-VNTR)输入,验证的基因座TbD1 RD9, pks15/1, RD(里约热内卢)和fbpC IS6110的插入一个站点特定于结核分枝杆菌拉丁美洲地中海(LAM)血统,和全基因组测序。这些标记的联合分析表明，该分离株实际上是结核分枝杆菌，更确切地属于LAM基因型。大多数分离株(n8)显示出多药耐药(MDR)，这促使我们对rpoA、rpoB、rpoC、katG和inhA基因进行了部分测序。7株(77.8%)katG携带S315T突变，其中1株(11%)inhA也存在C(-17)T单核苷酸多态性(SNP)。有趣的是，6个MDR分离株在rpoB的516密码子中也出现了未描述的12个核苷酸插入(CCA GAA CAA CCC)。在rpoA和rpoC中均未发现推定的补偿性突变。这是关于林氏结核分枝杆菌家族菌株具有收敛型pinnipedii spoligotype的首次报告。这些spoligotypes在基因型数据库中以适度的频率被观察到，这强调了在基于单一遗传标记识别结核分枝杆菌复合体中的分离株时必须谨慎。"

However, M. pinnipedii, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) predominantly in seals and sea lions, has never been isolated from a respiratory specimen in humans. Here we describe the first known human case of pulmonary TB caused by M. pinnipedii in a 79-year-old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic respiratory disease. The epidemiological data did not explain where the patient was exposed to M. pinnipedii, thus leaving the source of transmission unknown.

TITLE:Lung infection caused by Mycobacterium riyadhense confused with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: the first case in Korea.
ABSTRACT:A slowly growing, non-chromogenic mycobacterial strain was isolated from sputum and bronchial lavage fluid samples of a patient presenting with productive cough, blood-tinged sputum, low-grade fever, and weakness. A positive acid-fast bacilli sputum smear result prompted the initiation of an anti-tuberculosis regimen. Multiplex real-time PCR showed a negative result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and a positive result for nontuberculous mycobacteria. The DNA chip test confirmed this organism as a member of the genus Mycobacterium, but could not specify the species. Interestingly, the mycolic acid patterns obtained by HPLC nearly overlapped with those of M. simulans. The sequences of the Mycobacterium 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region were unique and were found to have 100% similarity with those of M. riyadhense. After a review of the literature, we report this case as the first Korean case of M. riyadhense lung infection."

TITLE:The first Saudi Arabian national inventory study revealed the upcoming challenges of highly diverse non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Incidences of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases are reportedly increasing globally and the current epidemiologic situation in Saudi Arabia remains unclear. To study such trend, we carried out a nationwide systematic epidemiological study focusing on NTM diseases for the first time in the country. METHODS/PRINCIPLE 
FINDINGS: A nationwide collection of NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data was conducted for a period of 24 months. Primary species identification was carried out by line probe assays followed by sequencing of 16S rRNA, 16S-23S ITS region, rpoB and hsp65 genes. The laboratory findings were comprehensively analysed against demographical and clinical data. A total of 527 isolates were enrolled with a higher proportion of Saudi citizens (76.5%), elderly (&gt;60 years) patients (34.2%), and male gender (65.3%) respectively. Overall, 75.1% isolates were pulmonary origin with a proven clinical significance of 44.7%. In total, 34 NTM species including 17 rare species were identified, in addition to 8 'undefined' isolates. M.simiae (22.6%), M.fortuitum (18.1%) and M.abscessus (17.8%) were predominant species. Interestingly, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M.riyadhense were also noticed (Primary data on emergence of rare NTM species and M.riyadhense has been recently reported). Results showed, rare clinical events such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis and ascites caused by M.wolinskyi, M.holsaticum, M.duvalii and M.monacence respectively. Diabetes mellitus (P value-0.04) and previous history of tuberculosis (P value- 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: NTM disease spectrum and pathogen diversity is an emerging challenge to any nation, including Saudi Arabia. Therefore, more priorities will be given to NTM's with an immediate initiative to develop diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans.

标题:沙特阿拉伯第一项国家清单研究揭示了高度多样化的非结核分枝杆菌疾病即将面临的挑战。
文摘:
背景:非结核分枝杆菌(NTM)引起肺和肺外疾病的发病率据报道在全球范围内呈上升趋势，目前沙特阿拉伯的流行病学情况仍不清楚。为了研究这一趋势，我们首次在全国范围内开展了以NTM疾病为重点的系统流行病学研究。方法/原理
结果:对全国范围内的NTM分离株进行了为期24个月的临床和人口统计学数据收集。初步的物种鉴定采用线探针法，然后对16S rRNA、16S- 23s ITS区、rpoB和hsp65基因进行测序。实验室结果与人口统计学和临床数据进行了综合分析。共纳入527株分离株，其中沙特公民(76.5%)、老年人(34.2%)和男性(65.3%)的比例较高。75.1%的分离株为肺源性分离株，临床意义为44.7%。共鉴定出34个NTM种，其中珍稀种17个，未鉴定的分离株8个。优势种为猴m.s iae(22.6%)、fortuitum(18.1%)和脓肿m.s iae(17.8%)。有趣的是，还发现了27例与临床相关的M.riyadhense病例(最近有关于稀有NTM物种和M.riyadhense出现的初步资料报道)。结果显示，由沃氏支菌血症、盲肠脓肿、杜氏支菌和单疱支菌引起的腹膜炎和腹水均为罕见的临床事件。糖尿病(P值-0.04)和既往结核病史(P值- 0.001)被确定为NTM疾病的独立危险因素。
结论/意义:NTM的病谱和病原体多样性对包括沙特阿拉伯在内的任何国家都是一个新出现的挑战。因此，将给予NTM更多的优先考虑，并立即采取行动制定诊断基础设施和疾病管理计划。"

ABSTRACT:Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection usually presents with a wide range of manifestations. Although HIV patients are prone to pulmonary infections by opportunistic pathogens in the late stage of AIDS, manifesting the disease with pulmonary infections caused by Mycobacterium riyadhense (newly identified non-tuberculous mycobacteria) is extremely rare with only one case reported in the literature. We are describing two previously healthy patients who presented with M. riyadhense lung infection and were subsequently found to have HIV, illustrating the need for considering the possibility M. riyadhense lung infection as a presenting illness of HIV.

TITLE:Burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases in Saudi Arabian children: The first nationwide experience.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases are increasing worldwide. A large paucity of data related to pediatric NTM diseases exists globally and particularly in Saudi Arabia. 
METHODS: The first nationwide exploratory study on existence of NTM diseases among Saudi Arabian children (0-14 years old) has been carried out during 2016-2017. Suspected NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data were enrolled from regional reference laboratories. Species level identification of isolates was carried out by commercial line probe assays and gene sequencing. 
RESULTS: In 12 months, 52 culture positive cases with 44(84.6%) confirmed disease incidences were identified. Demographically, Saudi nationals (86.5%) were dominated and 77.3% cases have different comorbid conditions. Lymphadenitis (40.4%) followed by 26.9% of pulmonary cases with 42.8% of confirmed clinical relevance were mainly reported. Species identification showed Mycobacterium simiae (31.8%), M. abscessus (23.1%) and nine other species including rarely encountering M. riyadhense. Ascites caused by M. monacense, pulmonary disease caused by M. riyadhense and M. monacense were rarest clinical events and reported for the first time globally in a pediatric cohort. 
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse NTM diseases even in immunocompetent children are an upcoming challenge in Saudi Arabia. Lack of awareness on NTM disease must be addressed with immediate development of management plans.

TITLE:Mycobacterium senuense sp. nov., a slowly growing, non-chromogenic species closely related to the Mycobacterium terrae complex.
ABSTRACT:A previously undescribed, slowly growing, non-chromogenic mycobacterium, isolated from a Korean patient with a symptomatic pulmonary infection, is described as representing a novel species. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence was unique and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that this organism belonged to the Mycobacterium terrae subclade. Phenotypically, the strain was generally similar to M. terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum, but its growth rate was slower than those of other M. terrae complex strains. A unique mycolic acid profile and phylogenetic analysis based on two different alternative chronometer molecules, hsp65 and rpoB, confirm the taxonomic status of this strain as a representative of a novel species. The name Mycobacterium senuense sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain 05-832(T) (=DSM 44999(T) =KCTC 19147(T))."

TITLE:Mycobacterium seoulense sp. nov., a slowly growing scotochromogenic species.
ABSTRACT:A previously undescribed, slowly growing, scotochromogenic mycobacterium was isolated from a patient with symptomatic pulmonary infection during hsp65 sequence-based identification of Korean clinical isolates. Phenetic characteristics of this strain were generally similar to those of Mycobacterium nebraskense and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. However, some phenetic characteristics differentiated it from these two species. Its 16S rRNA gene sequences were unique and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the organism in the slowly growing Mycobacterium group close to M. nebraskense and M. scrofulaceum. Its unique mycolic acid profiles and the results of phylogenetic analysis based on two independent alternative chronometer molecules, hsp65 and rpoB, confirmed the taxonomic status of this strain as representing a novel species. These data support the conclusion that this strain represents a novel mycobacterial species, for which the name Mycobacterium seoulense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain 03-19(T) (=DSM 44998(T)=KCTC 19146(T))."

TITLE:Mycobacterium sherrisii Lung Infection in a Brazilian Patient with Silicosis and a History of Pulmonary Tuberculosis.
ABSTRACT:Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) diseases became relevant with the emergence and spread of HIV and are also related to lung infection in non-HIV individuals with structural lung diseases. Mycobacterium sherrisii is a NTM first characterized in 2004. Only a few cases have been reported. The aim of this case report is to describe the first detailed case of infection with M. sherrisii in a patient with silicosis and history of pulmonary tuberculosis. A 50-year-old HIV-negative white male, previous smoker, with silicosis and a history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis developed a worsening of cough and expectoration pattern, and two sputum samples were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Presumptive treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, but, at month 5 of treatment, despite correct medication intake and slight improvement of symptoms, sputum bacilloscopy remained positive. Sputum cultures were positive Mycobacterium sherrisii. Treatment regimen was altered to streptomycin (for 2 months), ethambutol, clarithromycin, rifabutin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. M. sherrisii should be considered a possible etiological agent of lung infections in patients with pneumoconiosis and history of tuberculosis.

TITLE:Isolation and characterization of nontuberculous mycobacteria from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Ghana.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE/
BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species are assuming public health importance in pulmonary diseases; they are increasingly being isolated, and importantly, most NTMs do not respond to routine tuberculosis (TB) drugs. This study aimed to identify NTMs isolated from pulmonary TB cases and also determine their susceptibility to streptomycin (STR), isoniazid (INH), and rifampicin (RIF). 
METHODS: A total of 1755 mycobacterial isolates, obtained between August 2012 and July 2014, from 2036 smear-positive pulmonary cases were identified using polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS6110, and hsp65 gene sequencing analysis. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was then performed for the identified NTMs against STR, INH, and RIF using microplate Alamar blue assay. The results were analyzed against patients' biodata for statistical associations. 
RESULTS: Of the 1755 analyzed isolates, we identified 43 (2.5%) NTMs, which included 18 (41.9%) Mycobacterium intracellulare, 13 (30.2%) Mycobacterium avium subs. paratuberculosis, 5 (11.3%) Mycobacterium abscessus, 3 (7.0%) each of Mycobacterium mucogenicum and Mycobacterium colombiense, and 1 (2.3%) Mycobacterium simiae. Patients infected with NTMs (52.0%) were more likely to be human immunodeficiency virus-positive (P = 0.001, odds ratio = 6.6, 95% confidence interval = 2.7-16.2) than those infected with M. tuberculosis complex (5.8%). All the 43 (100%) NTMs were resistant to INH, whereas 32 (74%) and 19 (44%) were resistant to RIF and STR, respectively. Furthermore, 16 (37.2%) NTMs were resistant to all three drugs, 20 were resistant to INH and RIF, and 3 were resistant to STR and INH. All the M. abscessus isolates were resistant to all the three drugs, whereas all the M. avium isolates were resistant to INH and RIF, but only three were resistant to STR. Among the M. intracellulare isolates, 8, 18, and 15 isolates were resistant to STR, INH, and RIF, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: The observed high-resistance level to INH and RIF supports the need for rapid species identification and DST of nonresponding TB cases before retreatment.

文摘:目的/
背景:非结核分枝杆菌(NTM)在肺部疾病中具有公共卫生重要性;它们正日益被隔离，而且重要的是，大多数结核分枝杆菌对常规结核药物没有反应。这项研究的目的是鉴定从肺结核病例中分离出的NTMs，并确定它们对链霉素(STR)、异烟肼(INH)和利福平(RIF)的敏感性。
方法:2012年8月至2014年7月，从2036例痰涂片阳性肺部病例中分离出1755株分枝杆菌，采用IS6110聚合酶链反应扩增和hsp65基因测序分析。采用微孔板Alamar blue法对鉴定的NTMs进行抗STR、INH和RIF的药敏试验(DST)。将结果与患者的生物数据进行分析，以寻求统计学关联。
结果:1755株NTMs共分离出43株(2.5%)，其中胞内分枝杆菌18株(41.9%)，鸟分枝杆菌13株(30.2%)。脓肿分枝杆菌5株(11.3%)，粘原分枝杆菌3株(7.0%)，哥伦比亚分枝杆菌1株(2.3%)，猴分枝杆菌1株(2.3%)。感染NTMs的患者(52.0%)比感染M. tuberculosis的患者(5.8%)更可能是人类免疫缺陷病毒阳性(P = 0.001，优势比= 6.6,95%置信区间= 2.7-16.2)。43个NTMs对INH均有抗性(100%)，32个NTMs对RIF和STR分别有74%和44%的抗性。16例(37.2%)NTMs对3种药物均有耐药性，20例对INH和RIF有耐药性，3例对STR和INH有耐药性。脓肿分枝杆菌对3种药物均有耐药性，禽分枝杆菌对INH和RIF均有耐药性，仅3株对STR有耐药性，胞内分枝杆菌对STR、INH和RIF分别有8株、18株和15株。
结论:观察到的INH和RIF的高耐药水平支持了在再治疗前对无反应结核病病例进行快速菌种鉴定和筛选的必要性。"

TITLE:Profile of patients with pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease mimicking pulmonary tuberculosis.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: With the introduction of newer molecular diagnostic tools, an increasing number of Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) affecting the respiratory system and mimicking symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are being identified. They may be misdiagnosed and treated as PTB, often categorized as treatment failures if they do not respond to treatment. This manuscript aims to characterize patients with pulmonary NTM disease. 
METHODS: Patient characteristics of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary NTM disease, attending the ICMR-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai were prospectively compiled over a two-year period (2017-2018). 
RESULTS: A total of 122 patients with recurrent chest symptoms and not responding to anti-tuberculosis treatment were screened for NTM. Thirty-nine cases (26 males and 13 females) of symptomatic pulmonary NTM were diagnosed. The mean (SD) patient age and body mass index were 48.6 +- 11 years and 16.3 +- 3. All male participants were smokers, had at least one episode of previous ATT. Mycobacterium kansasii (48.7%) was the most frequently isolated species followed by Mycobacterium intracellulare (20.5%), Mycobacterium abscessus (7.6%) followed by Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kyorinense, and Mycobacterium simiae. Infection with multiple NTMs was seen in four patients. Isoniazid resistance was identified in 20 patients. Based on species identified, treatment was initiated as per American Thoracic Society guidelines and continued up to 12 months of culture negativity. 
CONCLUSIONS: M. kansasii is the commonest pulmonary NTM isolated in Tamilnadu with a higher prevalence in males and elderly. Sensitization of both patients and providers is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis of pulmonary NTM disease as pulmonary TB.

TITLE:Localized pulmonary infection associated with Mycobacterium tilburgii in an HIV-infected patient.
ABSTRACT:The case of an HIV-infected patient with low CD4+ cell count and localized pulmonary infection associated with Mycobacterium tilburgii, a recently recognized atypical mycobacterial species, is reported. Diagnosis was confirmed by repeated detection of mycobacterial DNA in lung biopsy specimens. After surgical removal of the pulmonary nodules, treatment with antimycobacterial combination therapy led to a complete and sustained recovery of the respiratory symptoms.M. tilburgii so far has only been described to cause disseminated infection in three patients, two of them suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first report of localized pulmonary disease attributed to this mycobacterial species. As it responds to antimycobacterial combination therapy, efforts to establish the diagnosis using PCR methods in patients with suspected pulmonary disease due to mycobacteria other than tuberculosis should be undertaken."

TITLE:Multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacteria isolated from cystic fibrosis patients.
ABSTRACT:Worldwide, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have become emergent pathogens of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 5 to 20%. This work investigated the presence of NTM in sputum samples of 129 CF patients (2 to 18 years old) submitted to longitudinal clinical supervision at a regional reference center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June 2009 to March 2012, 36 NTM isolates recovered from 10 (7.75%) out of 129 children were obtained. Molecular identification of NTM was performed by using PCR restriction analysis targeting the hsp65 gene (PRA-hsp65) and sequencing of the rpoB gene, and susceptibility tests were performed that followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. For evaluating the genotypic diversity, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and/or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) was performed. The species identified were Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii (n = 24), M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (n = 6), Mycobacterium fortuitum (n = 3), Mycobacterium marseillense (n = 2), and Mycobacterium timonense (n = 1). Most of the isolates presented resistance to five or more of the antimicrobials tested. Typing profiles were mainly patient specific. The PFGE profiles indicated the presence of two clonal groups for M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and five clonal groups for M. abscesssus subsp. bolletii, with just one clone detected in two patients. Given the observed multidrug resistance patterns and the possibility of transmission between patients, we suggest the implementation of continuous and routine investigation of NTM infection or colonization in CF patients, including countries with a high burden of tuberculosis disease.

ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium triplex, a recently described slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, was isolated from a Finnish patient with pulmonary mycobacteriosis. The disease was successfully treated with antimycobacterial drugs. The strain isolated, which was similar to the type strain but differed slightly from the species description, was regarded as a variant of M. triplex sensu stricto. According to present knowledge this variant of the species has never been isolated before."

TITLE:Mycobacterium triplex pulmonary disease in an immunocompetent host: A case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium triplex (M. triplex) is a bacterial species that can cause severe pulmonary diseases. Despite its clinical importance, only a few cases of M. triplex infection have been reported. Here, we present a rare case of pulmonary disease due to M. triplex in an immunocompetent patient who showed abnormal findings on chest X-ray and computed tomography scans. In this patient, the bacterium was identified by DNA sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 genes. The patient was successfully treated with the appropriate antimicrobial agents. To put this case into the context of the current literature, we also reviewed other case reports of M. triplex infection.

TITLE:The clinical significance of Mycobacterium triplex.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: Mycobacterium triplex is a slow-growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and is a rare cause of human disease. The pathogenicity, natural history and spectrum of disease is unknown. The aim of this study was to review the clinical features, outcomes and drug susceptibility testing (DST) of all M. triplex isolates in Queensland, Australia to guide management of this rare NTM infection in the future. 
METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients who isolated M. triplex in Queensland, Australia from the 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2016. Clinical information was obtained from medical records to determine the clinical significance of isolates, natural history of disease and treatment outcomes. DST was performed on 15 isolates. 
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (21 male) had positive cultures for M. triplex. Thirty-nine patients had isolates from pulmonary specimens and 17 (43.6%) met the American Thoracic Society criteria for NTM lung disease. Six patients with pulmonary infection received antimicrobial therapy with 5 patients demonstrating treatment success. Four patients had localised extrapulmonary disease and were cured with surgical management +- antimicrobial therapy. DST suggests 93% of isolates are susceptible to macrolides. 
CONCLUSION: This is the largest case series of M. triplex isolates and confirms it is a rare human pathogen. Extrapulmonary disease responded well to surgical management. Treatment of M. triplex pulmonary disease is challenging, and the optimal antimicrobial regimen is unknown. However, the DST data suggests macrolide resistance is rare and macrolides should be included in treatment regimens.

题目:三分支杆菌的临床意义。
摘要:目的:三分枝杆菌是一种生长缓慢的非结核分枝杆菌(NTM)，是一种罕见的人类疾病。致病力、自然病程和疾病谱尚不清楚。本研究的目的是回顾澳大利亚昆士兰所有M. triplex分离株的临床特征、结果和药敏试验(DST)，以指导今后对这种罕见的NTM感染的管理。
方法:回顾性研究包括2000年1月1日至2016年12月31日在澳大利亚昆士兰州分离到三型结核分枝杆菌的所有患者。从病历中获取临床信息，以确定分离株的临床意义、疾病的自然病史和治疗结果。在15个隔离上执行了DST。
结果:43例患者(21例男性)三型结核菌阳性。39例患者分离自肺部标本，17例(43.6%)符合美国胸科协会NTM肺病的标准。6例肺部感染患者接受抗菌治疗，5例治疗成功。4例患者局部肺外疾病，经手术治疗+抗菌药物治疗治愈。DST表明，93%的分离株对大环内酯类药物敏感。
结论:该病例为三联支原体分离株中最大的病例系列，证实为一种罕见的人类病原。肺外疾病对外科治疗反应良好。治疗三联性支原体肺疾病是具有挑战性的，并且最佳的抗菌方案是未知的。然而，分级存储数据表明大环内酯类药物耐药情况罕见，治疗方案中应包括大环内酯类药物。"

TITLE:Nontuberculous mycobacteria in respiratory samples from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the state of Rondonia, Brazil.
ABSTRACT:The main cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We aimed to evaluate the contribution of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) to pulmonary disease in patients from the state of Rondonia using respiratory samples and epidemiological data from TB cases. Mycobacterium isolates were identified using a combination of conventional tests, polymerase chain reaction-based restriction enzyme analysis of hsp65 gene and hsp65 gene sequencing. Among the 1,812 cases suspected of having pulmonary TB, 444 yielded bacterial cultures, including 369 cases positive for MTB and 75 cases positive for NTM. Within the latter group, 14 species were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium gilvum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium asiaticum, Mycobacterium tusciae, Mycobacterium porcinum, Mycobacterium novocastrense, Mycobacterium simiae, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium holsaticum and 13 isolates could not be identified at the species level. The majority of NTM cases were observed in Porto Velho and the relative frequency of NTM compared with MTB was highest in Ji-Parana. In approximately half of the TB subjects with NTM, a second sample containing NTM was obtained, confirming this as the disease-causing agent. The most frequently observed NTM species were M. abscessus and M. avium and because the former species is resistant to many antibiotics and displays unsatisfactory cure rates, the implementation of rapid identification of mycobacterium species is of considerable importance.

TITLE:Emergence of Rare Species of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria as Potential Pathogens in Saudi Arabian Clinical Setting.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Clinical relevance of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is increasing worldwide including in Saudi Arabia. A high species diversity of NTM's has been noticed in a recent study. However, the identification in diagnostic laboratories is mostly limited to common species. The impact of NTM species diversity on clinical outcome is so far neglected in most of the clinical settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS: During April 2014 to September 2015, a nationwide collection of suspected NTM clinical isolates with clinical and demographical data were carried out. Primary identification was performed by commercial line probe assays. Isolates identified up to Mycobacterium species level by line probe assays only were included and subjected to sequencing of 16S rRNA, rpoB, hsp65 and 16S-23S ITS region genes. The sequence data were subjected to BLAST analysis in GenBank and Ez-Taxon databases. Male Saudi nationals were dominated in the study population and falling majorly into the 46-59 years age group. Pulmonary cases were 59.3% with a surprising clinical relevance of 75% based on American Thoracic Society guidelines. Among the 40.7% extra-pulmonary cases, 50% of them were skin infections. The identification revealed 16 species and all of them are reporting for the first time in Saudi Arabia. The major species obtained were Mycobacterium monascence (18.5%), M. cosmeticum (11.1%), M. kubicae (11.1%), M. duvalli (7.4%), M.terrae (7.4%) and M. triplex (7.4%). This is the first report on clinical relevance of M. kubicae, M. tusciae, M.yongonense, M. arupense and M.iranicum causing pulmonary disease and M. monascence, M. duvalli, M. perigrinum, M. insubricum, M. holsaticum and M. kyorinense causing various extra-pulmonary diseases in Saudi Arabia. Ascites caused by M. monascence and cecum infection by M. holsaticum were the rarest incidents. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To the first time in the country, clinical significance of various rare NTM's are well explored and the finding warrants a new threat to the Saudi Arabian clinical settings.

TITLE:Mycobacterium yongonense sp. nov., a slow-growing non-chromogenic species closely related to Mycobacterium intracellulare.
ABSTRACT:A slow-growing non-chromogenic mycobacterium was isolated from a patient with pulmonary disease. Phenotypically, strain 05-1390(T) was similar to Mycobacterium intracellulare ATCC 13950(T). The 16S rRNA gene sequence (1385 bp) of strain 05-1390(T) showed a high degree of similarity to those of the M. intracellulare complex, namely Mycobacterium marseillense 5351974(T) (100 %), M. intracellulare ATCC 13950(T) (99.8 %) and Mycobacterium chimaera DSM 44623(T) (99.9 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and the hsp65 gene indicated that strain 05-1390(T) was closely related to M. intracellulare ATCC 13950(T), but that it was a distinct phylogenetic entity. Of particular interest, an analysis based on the rpoB gene (701 bp) showed that it is closely related to Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum ATCC BAA-614(T) (99.4 %), a scotochromogenic strain, rather than to the M. intracellulare-related strains. Unique MALDI-TOF MS profiles also supported the taxonomic status of this strain as a distinct species. These data support the conclusion that strain 05-1390(T) represents a novel mycobacterial species, for which the name Mycobacterium yongonense sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 05-1390(T) ( = DSM 45126(T) = KCTC 19555(T))."

TITLE:Distribution and clinical significance of Mycobacterium avium complex species isolated from respiratory specimens.
ABSTRACT:Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was originally composed of 2 species, M. avium and M. intracellulare. However, several new species closely related to M. intracellulare have recently been identified. In addition, M. avium has been further subdivided into 4 subspecies. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of different MAC species recovered from respiratory specimens and to elucidate the clinical relevance of these species. Clinical isolates, from 219 patients, that had been initially identified as M. avium or M. intracellulare by non-sequencing methods were reidentified using multilocus sequence typing, and the clinical significance of the identified species was then investigated. Of 91 isolates originally identified as M. intracellulare, 75 (82%) were confirmed to be M. intracellulare, 8 (9%) isolates were identified as M. chimaera, and 4 (4%) isolates each were identified as ""M. indicus pranii"" and M. yongonense. The 128 isolates originally designated as M. avium were determined to be M. avium subsp. hominissuis. Of the 219 patients, 146 (67%) met the diagnostic criteria for MAC lung disease, and for each MAC species, the proportion of patients meeting these criteria was as follows: M. intracellulare (54/75, 72%), M. chimaera (3/8, 38%), ""M. indicus pranii"" (3/4, 75%), M. yongonense (2/4, 50%), and M. avium subsp. hominissuis (84/128, 66%). In summary, multilocus sequence typing of respiratory isolates initially identified as MAC revealed that, although most isolates were M. avium subsp. hominissuis or M. intracellulare, approximately 7% were newer MAC members, with clinical evidence supporting their potential pathogenicity for humans.

TITLE:Genome sequence of Mycobacterium yongonense RT 955-2015 isolate from a patient misdiagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: First clinical detection in Tanzania.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium yongonense is a recently described novel species belonging to Mycobacterium avium complex, which is the most prevalent aetiology of non-tuberculous mycobacteria associated with pulmonary infections, and poses tuberculosis diagnostic challenges in high-burden, resource-constrained settings. 
METHODS: Whole genome shotgun sequencing and comparative microbial genomic analyses were used to characterize the isolate from a patient diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) after relapse. 
RESULTS: The genome sequence of the first case of M. yongonense (M. yongonense RT 955-2015) in Tanzania is presented. Sequence analysis revealed that the RT 955-2015 strain had a high similarity to M. yongonense 05-1390(T) (98.74%) and Mycobacterium chimaera DSM 44623(T) (98%). Its 16S rRNA showed similarity to Mycobacterium paraintracellulare KCTC 290849(T) (100%), Mycobacterium intracellulare ATCC 13950(T) (100%), M. chimaera DSM 44623(T) (99.9%), and M. yongonense 05-1390(T) (98%). The strain exhibited a substantially different rpoB sequence to that of M. yongonense 05-1390 (95.16%), but closely related to that of M. chimaera DSM 44623(T) (99.86%), M. intracellulare ATCC 13950(T), (99.53%), and M. paraintracellulare KCTC 290849(T) (99.53%). 
CONCLUSIONS: In light of the OrthoANI algorithm and phylogenetic analysis, it was concluded that the isolate was M. yongonense Type II genotype, which is an indication that the patient was misdiagnosed with TB/MDR-TB and received inappropriate treatment.

标题:1例误诊耐多药结核病患者永农杆菌RT 955-2015分离株基因组序列:首次在坦桑尼亚临床检测。
文摘:
背景:yongonense分枝杆菌是一种新近被描述的属于鸟分枝杆菌复合体的新物种，鸟分枝杆菌复合体是与肺部感染相关的非结核分枝杆菌最普遍的病因，并在高负担、资源有限的环境下给结核病诊断带来挑战。
方法:采用全基因组散弹枪测序和比较微生物基因组分析对1例复发后诊断为耐多药结核病(MDR-TB)患者分离的菌株进行鉴定。
结果:获得了坦桑尼亚首例永农虫(m.y yongonense RT 955-2015)的基因组序列。序列分析显示RT 955-2015株与yongonense 05-1390(T)和chimaera DSM 44623(T)具有高度相似性(98.74%)。其16S rRNA与paraintraccellulare分枝杆菌KCTC 290849(T)(100%)、胞内分枝杆菌ATCC 13950(T)(100%)、chimera DSM 44623(T)(99.9%)和yongonense分枝杆菌05-1390(T)(98%)相似。rpoB序列与yongonense 05-1390株差异显著(95.16%)，与chimaera DSM 44623(T)、cellulare ATCC 13950(T)、99.53%和paraintracellulare KCTC 290849(T)的rpoB序列接近(99.53%)。
结论:根据OrthoANI算法和系统发育分析，该分离物为yongonense II型基因型，提示患者被误诊为TB/MDR-TB，治疗不当。"

TITLE:Pulmonary nocardiosis: A Single Center Study.
ABSTRACT:Objectives: Nocardiosis is a rare infection caused by Nocardia spp., a gram-positive bacteria non-commensal of the human flora. Nocardiosis usually presents with lung infection but may disseminate to other organs, most frequently the brain. The major risk factor is immunosuppression, but lung diseases also increase the risk of infection. Treatment with antibiotics is usually prolonged. In this study, we made a retrospective analysis of pulmonary nocardiosis cases and a review of the available literature. Methods: We made a retrospective analysis of all pulmonary nocardiosis cases from 13 years (January 2005 to December 2017) in our institution, selecting patients from pulmonology and infectious diseases consultation. Results: We found four patients diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis, three males (patients 1, 2 and 3) and one female (patient 4). Median age was 71 +- 15 years old. Different specimens were identified (N. cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia spp., N. nova, and N. wallacei/transvalensis). Bronchofibroscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage culture was the most frequent diagnostic procedure (patients 1 and 4). Only patient 2 presented an unfavorable response to treatment and died from septic shock. Conclusions: Pulmonary nocardiosis has a good prognosis if diagnosed early and treated adequately. It should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infections concomitant with brain or other soft tissue lesion, especially in immunocompromised patients.

TITLE:Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Nocardiosis including those caused by emerging Nocardia species in Taiwan, 1998-2008.
ABSTRACT:The genus of Nocardia is rapidly expanding and the species distribution varies with different geographical locations. We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory records of the bacteriology laboratory at National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1998 to June 2008 to identify patients with nocardiosis. During the study period, 164 isolates of Nocardia spp. were identified from 134 patients but only 113 patients had Nocardia infection. Nocardia brasiliensis (n = 54) was the most common pathogen, followed by N. asteroides (n = 36), N. farcinica (n = 7), N. flavorosea (n = 4), N. otitidiscaviarum (n = 3), N. nova (n = 3), N. beijingensis (n = 2) and one each of N. puris, N. jinanensis and N. takedensis. The major types of infection were cutaneous infection (56.6%), pulmonary infection (33.6%) and disseminated infection (7.1%). Eighty-eight patients received sulfonamide-containing antibiotic and eight of 100 patients with available data on outcomes died during the episode of nocardiosis. In conclusion, the clinical and microbiological manifestations of Nocardiosis vary with the different Nocardia species. Accurate identification of the species is crucial to make the diagnosis."

TITLE:Nocardia africana sp. nov., a new pathogen isolated from patients with pulmonary infections.
ABSTRACT:Eight actinomycete strains, isolated from 8 out of 400 sputum samples examined, taken from patients with pulmonary diseases at the Chest Unit of Khartoum Teaching Hospital in the Sudan, were provisionally assigned to the genus Nocardia according to morphological criteria. These isolates were studied further in order to establish their taxonomic status. They were found to have morphological and chemical properties typical of nocardiae and formed a monophyletic clade in the 16S ribosomal DNA tree together with Nocardia vaccinii. The strains showed a unique pattern of phenotypic properties that distinguished them from representatives of recognized Nocardia species, including Nocardia vaccinii. The strains were considered to merit species status and were designated Nocardia africana sp. nov. The findings of the present study are consistent with the view that pulmonary nocardiosis may occur in a substantial proportion of patients who exhibit chronic lung diseases in African countries. It is important, therefore, that clinicians in such countries consider this condition, especially when patients with respiratory infections fail to respond to antitubercular therapy."

TITLE:Nocardia araoensis sp. nov. and Nocardia pneumoniae sp. nov., isolated from patients in Japan.
ABSTRACT:Two actinomycete strains isolated from two patients with lung nocardiosis between 1995 and 1997 in Japan were assigned to novel species of the genus Nocardia based on morphological and chemical criteria. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the two strains revealed that they belong to the genus Nocardia and are most closely related to the species Nocardia beijingensis. Determination of DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that these strains could be assigned to two novel species. Based on their phenotypic and phylogenetic characters, two novel species of the genus Nocardia are proposed: Nocardia araoensis sp. nov. for IFM 0575(T) (=NBRC 100135(T)=JCM 12118(T)=DSM 44729(T)) and Nocardia pneumoniae sp. nov. for IFM 0784(T) (=NBRC 100136(T)=JCM 12119(T)=DSM 44730(T))."

TITLE:[Microbiological and clinical features of nine cases with nocardial infections].
ABSTRACT:Following recent advance in medical technology, the increase of immunocompromised patients results in an increase of opportunistic infections such as nocardiosis. However, little is known about relationships between clinical features of nocardial infections and each Nocardia species, especially newly identified ones. Therefore, we identified clinical isolates of Nocardia species by genetic methods and analyzed clinical features of nocardiosis. Nine clinical isolates were obtained in Kyushu University Hospital from 2005 to 2008. Six different Nocardia species were identified by 16Sr RNA: Nocardiafarcinia (n=2), Nocardia brasiliensis (n=2), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia transvalensis (n=1), Nocardia araoensis (n=1) and Nocardia testacea (n=1). The underlying diseases of 9 patients were pulmonary diseases(n=5), malignant diseases(n=3), collagen diseases(n=1) or primary immunodeficiency diseases (n=l). According to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, none of them was resistant to minocycline or linezolid. Among seven isolates from respiratory specimens, one was resistant to imipenem, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amikacin, two were to ciprofloxacin. Three species identified recently (N cyriacigeorgica, N. araoensis and N. testacea) were involved in this study and most of them were considered as infectious pathogens to human. These data suggested the identification of Nocardia to the species level and susceptibility testing were important for diagnosis as infectious diseases and treatments."

TITLE:Cladophialophora bantiana Cerebral Phaeohyphomycosis Complicated by Pulmonary Nocardiosis: A Tale of Two Infections.
ABSTRACT:Cladophialophora bantiana, a melanized neurotropic fungus, is the most commonly reported agent of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. We present a case of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis due to C. bantiana with a concomitant Nocardia infection in the lung. The patient was a 64-year-old male who presented with one-week history of productive cough, confusion, and staggering gait. Brain MRI showed multiple enhancing masses, and chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidation. To confirm diagnosis, brain biopsy was performed that showed Cladophialophora bantiana. Bronchoscopic lung biopsy confirmed infection with Nocardia araoensis. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, meropenem, voriconazole, and liposomal amphotericin in addition to partial resection of the brain mass. After several weeks in the hospital and deteriorating status with poor prognosis, medical care was withdrawn. Cladophialophora bantiana infection is rare and requires multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnostic confirmation. Aggressive and long-term treatment with voriconazole along with early neurosurgical intervention may offer an improved chance of survival in these patients.

TITLE:Nocardia donostiensis sp. nov., isolated from human respiratory specimens.
ABSTRACT:Three human clinical isolates (X1654, X1655, and W9944) were recovered from the sputum and bronchial washings of two patients with pulmonary infections. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the isolates showed that they share 100 % sequence similarity with each other and belong to the genus Nocardia. Close phylogenetic neighbours are Nocardia brevicatena ATCC 15333(T) (98.6 %) and Nocardia paucivorans ATCC BAA-278T (98.4 %). The in silico DNA-DNA relatedness between the isolates ranges from 96.8 to 100 % suggesting that they belong to the same genomic species. The DNA-DNA relatedness between X1654 and N. brevicatena ATCC 15333(T) is 13.3 +- 2.3 % and N. paucivorans ATCC BAA-278T is 18.95 +- 1.1 % suggesting that they do not belong to the same genomic species. Believed to represent a novel species, these isolates were further characterised to establish their taxonomic standing within the genus. Chemotaxonomic data for isolate X1654 are consistent with those described for the genus Nocardia: this isolate produced saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, tuberculostearic acid (15.9 %), the major menaquinone was MK-8 (H4cyclic), mycolic acid chain lengths ranged from 38 to 58 carbons, produced meso-diaminopimelic acid with arabinose, glucose, and galactose as the whole cell sugars. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. The DNA G+C content is 66.7 mol  %. Based on the combination of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genotypic data for X1654, X1655, and W9944, we conclude that these isolates represent a novel species within the genus Nocardia for which we propose the name Nocardia donostiensis sp. nov. with X1654(T) (=DSM 46814(T) = CECT 8839(T)) as the type strain.

TITLE:Review of nocardial infections in France 1987 to 1990.
ABSTRACT:On the basis of the numbers of Nocardia strains referred to the National Reference Center for Mycoses and Antifungal Agents (NRC), Institut Pasteur, Paris, in the period from 1987 to 1990, it was estimated that between 150 and 250 cases of nocardiosis are diagnosed in France each year. A total of 63 clinical isolates were referred to the NRC and identified as Nocardia asteroides (66.7%), Nocardia farcinica (23.8%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.2%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (4.8%) and Nocardia carnea (1.5%). Nocardia asteroides accounted for 71.4% of pulmonary infections, 80.0% of central nervous system infections and 80.0% of systemic infections. Patients infected with Nocardia farcinica died in 57.1% of cases, compared with 17.6% of patients infected with Nocardia asteroides. Corticosteroid therapy represented a significant factor in mortality. Isolates of Nocardia asteroides revealed variable resistance, whereas isolates of Nocardia farcinica were resistant to most antimicrobial agents. Only amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefoxitin, kanamycin, amikacin, minocycline and vancomycin showed activity against both species. Nocardiosis caused by Nocardia farcinica may be a growing problem because of the relatively high incidence in AIDS patients and the resistance of this species to most antimicrobial agents."

TITLE:Nocardiosis at the turn of the century.
ABSTRACT:Nocardia species is an uncommon pathogen that affects both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. The clinical and microbiologic spectrum of nocardiosis has changed recently due to the widespread use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, the emergence of new types of immunosuppressed patients, and the improved identification of isolates using molecular techniques. Nocardia asteroides was traditionally considered the predominant organism, and prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole was considered almost universally protective. We conducted the current study to determine the incidence of nocardiosis and its microbiologic and clinical characteristics in a general hospital over the last 12 years. We reviewed the clinical records of all patients in whom Nocardia species was isolated from clinical specimens between 1995 and 2006. Nocardia isolates were identified by standard procedures and by 5' end 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Susceptibility to cotrimoxazole, minocycline, imipenem, linezolid, and amikacin was determined by the broth microdilution method following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.The incidence of Nocardia infections did not increase significantly during the study period (0.39/100,000 inhabitants in 1995-1998 and 0.55/100,000 inhabitants in 2003-2006). Nocardia was recovered from 43 patients. Six were considered to be colonized. The colonizing species were N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. asteroides. All colonized patients had severe underlying pulmonary conditions and were treated with antimicrobials (6 patients) or corticosteroids (4 patients). Invasive nocardiosis was diagnosed in 37 patients (86.5% were men, and their mean age was 55.8 +/- 17.3 yr). The most common underlying condition in our institution was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (10 patients; 27%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8 patients; 21.6%), autoimmune diseases (8 patients; 21.6%), solid organ transplantation (7 patients; 18.9%), and cancer (4 patients; 10.8%). The most important risk factor for nocardiosis was corticosteroid administration (23 patients; 62.2%). Nocardiosis affected the lungs in 26 cases (70.3%), the skin in 3 cases (8.1%), and the central nervous system in 2 cases (5.4%). It was disseminated in 5 cases (13.5%) and caused otomastoiditis in 1 (2.7%). The species identified were N. cyriacigeorgica (32.4%), N. farcinica (24.3%), N. otitidiscaviarum (10.8%), N. veterana (8.1%), N. nova (5.4%), N. abscessus (5.4%), N. asiatica (2.7%), N. beijingensis (2.7%), N. brasiliensis (2.7%), N. carnea (2.7%), and Nocardia species (2.7%).Linezolid and amikacin were uniformly active against all the isolates, whereas 29.7% of isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to minocycline (minimum inhibitory concentration = 2 mg/L), 10.8% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, and 5.4% were resistant to imipenem. Nocardiosis occurred while the patients were on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 8 cases (21.6%). The strains isolated from these patients were susceptible to cotrimoxazole in 5 cases (62.5%) and resistant in 3 (37.5%). Overall, 13 patients died (35.1%); related mortality was 21.6% (8 patients). We conclude that HIV infection has become the most common underlying condition for invasive nocardiosis in our institution, followed by chronic lung disease. Previous use of corticosteroids was the main risk factor and was present in more than half the patients. New species of Nocardia have been identified, and administration of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should no longer be considered highly reliable protection against nocardiosis. Larger studies of nocardiosis are required to better identify risk factors associated with mortality, and alternative and more effective methods of prevention must be developed."

TITLE:Clinical and microbiological characteristics of infections caused by various Nocardia species in Taiwan: a multicenter study from 1998 to 2010.
ABSTRACT:This multicenter study in Taiwan investigated the clinical presentations of various Nocardia species infections based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Patients with nocardiosis in four large medical centers from 1998 to 2010 were included. A total of 100 preserved nonduplicate isolates causing human infection were identified as Nocardia species. Sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA confirmed that 35 of 36 N. asteroides isolates identified by conventional tests were non-asteroides Nocardia species, and that two of 50 N. brasiliensis isolates had also been initially misidentified. N. brasiliensis (50%) was the most common pathogen, followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (18%). In addition, several rare pathogens were identified, including N. asiatica, N. rhamnosiphila, N. abscessus, N. transvalensis, N. elegans, and N. carnea. Primary cutaneous infection was the most common presentation, noted in 55 (55%) patients, while pulmonary infection presented in 26 (26%) patients. The crude mortality rate was 6.7% (6/89), and was lowest for primary cutaneous infection (2.2%) and highest for disseminated disease and pulmonary infection (16.7%). In conclusion, N. brasiliensis and N. cyriacigeorgica were the most common pathogens causing nocardiosis in Taiwan. Molecular methods for identifying Nocardia to the species level are mandatory for better understanding the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of patients with nocardiosis."

TITLE:Molecular identification and susceptibility pattern of clinical Nocardia species: Emergence of Nocardia crassostreae as an agent of invasive nocardiosis.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Nocardia species are rare, opportunistic organisms that cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. 
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents. 
METHODS: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. 
RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. DISCUSSION: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. 
CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections. Nocardiosis manifests various clinical features depending on the Nocardia species and underlying conditions."

TITLE:Epidemiology and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of the main Nocardia species in Spain.
ABSTRACT:Objectives: The aims of this study were to explore the clinical distribution, by species, of the genus Nocardia and to assess the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the 10 most prevalent species identified in Spain. Methods: Over a 10 year period (2005-14), 1119 Nocardia strains were molecularly identified and subjected to the Etest. The distribution and resistance trends over the sub-periods 2005-09 and 2010-14 were also examined. Results: Of the strains examined, 82.9% belonged to the following species: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (25.3%), Nocardia nova (15.0%), Nocardia abscessus (12.7%), Nocardia farcinica (11.4%), Nocardia carnea (4.3%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.5%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (3.1%), Nocardia flavorosea (2.6%), Nocardia rhamnosiphila (2.6%) and Nocardia transvalensis (2.4%). Their prevalence values were similar during 2005-09 and 2010-14, except for those of N. abscessus , N. farcinica and N. transvalensis , which fell significantly in the second sub-period ( P &lt;=  0.05). The major location of isolation was the respiratory tract (~86%). Half (13/27) of all strains from the CNS were N. farcinica . Significant differences in MIC results were recorded for some species between the two sub-periods. According to the CLSI's breakpoints, low resistance rates (&lt;=15%) were recorded for seven species with respect to cefotaxime, imipenem and tobramycin; five species showed similar rates with respect to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Linezolid and amikacin were the most frequently active agents. Conclusion: The accurate identification of the infecting species and the determination of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, given the large number of strains with atypical patterns, are crucial if patients with nocardiosis are to be successfully treated.

ABSTRACT:Nocardia concava was identified as a new species in 2005; however, the clinical manifestations of Nocardia concava infection have yet to be clarified. We herein present the case of an immunosuppressed patient who developed disseminated nocardiosis caused by N. concava with multiple abscesses in the lungs, cutis, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscles and kidneys accompanied by central nervous system involvement, including meningitis and ventriculitis. The patient was cured with appropriate treatment including linezolid after testing for susceptibility. Linezolid should be considered as an alternative agent for treating disseminated nocardiosis because of its effective distribution to multiple sites."

ABSTRACT:We herein report on a 69-year-old male who developed lung nocardiosis and brain abscessation. In April 2011, he was diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by peripheral neuropathy. Immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose prednisolone was begun. In November 2011, he developed cryptococcal pneumonia and meningitis, which was treated with liposomal amphotericin and flucytosine for 4 weeks and was maintained with fluconazole. In April 2012, consolidation and peripheral atelectasis in the right middle lobe appeared. Bronchoscopy revealed edematous mucosa in the right middle bronchus and occlusive change of the right B4 and B5, but biopsy and culture results provided no etiological information. In late June, he developed an intermittent fever, and obstructive pneumonia of the right middle lobe was suspected. Nocardia species were detected from the sputum culture and were thought to be the causative pathogen. Brain CT and MRI revealed a contrast-enhanced lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The patient was diagnosed as having lung nocardiosis and brain abscessation. Considering that the nocardiosis had developed under prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia using one tablet per day of a sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination, meropenem and amikacin were administered in addition to the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination for 6 and 4 weeks, respectively. After N. elegans had been identified from the sputum, antibiotics were switched to a sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination and clarithromycin based on the susceptibility results. The patient's clinical and radiological findings were improved and have been well sustained.

TITLE:Nocardia elegans sp. nov., a member of the Nocardia vaccinii clade isolated from sputum.
ABSTRACT:Two bacterial isolates from the sputa of a patient with a pulmonary infection were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Chemotaxonomic investigations revealed the presence of cell-wall chemotype IV and mycolic acids consistent with the profile for the genus Nocardia. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that these isolates constitute a distinct subline within the genus Nocardia, displaying 99.6-95.5% sequence similarities with established species. However, DNA-DNA hybridization studies demonstrated unambiguously that the isolates are genealogically distinct from closely related species, namely Nocardia veterana and Nocardia africana, which show high levels of 16S rRNA sequence similarity (99.2 and 99.6% sequence similarity, respectively). On the basis of both phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that these isolates be classified as a novel species of the genus Nocardia, for which the name Nocardia elegans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMMIB N-402(T) (=CCUG 50200(T)=CIP 108553(T))."

ABSTRACT:A 47-year-old man with optimally controlled type-2 diabetes mellitus and chronic hepatitis B was admitted to a local hospital because of a 1-week history of cough and high-grade fever. He was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and Klebsiella pneumonia from a chest radiograph and sputum. Simultaneously, he was found to have HIV infection with a CD4 count of 76/mul. Despite alteration of treatment secondary to the development of allergic reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the patient was able to complete a 3-week therapy for PCP after being switched to pentamidine isetionate. After the treatment of PCP, he was referred to our hospital for the initiation of anti-HIV therapy. He presented with recurrent high-grade fever of a few days' duration prior to his initial visit, which subsequently led to his admission. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed the enlargement of a previously identified infiltrate in the left upper lung field, and the sputum culture upon admission was positive for Gram-positive branching rods; the organism was later identified as Nocardia exalbida. Due to his allergy to sulfonamide, the patient was treated with imipenem (IMP) and amikacin (AMK) given intravenously for 17 days, followed by garenoxacin (GRNX) taken orally for 6 months, without any adverse effects. The chest infiltrate resolved completely, and he remains stable without relapse 8 months after the completion of the therapy. Pulmonary nocardiosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis of recurring pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, especially in HIV-infected individuals. Oral administration of GRNX following IMP and AMK can be used as an alternative to TMP-SMX therapy in cases of pulmonary nocardiosis caused by N. exalbida."

TITLE:Molecular identification of nocardia isolates from clinical samples and an overview of human nocardiosis in Brazil.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Nocardia sp. causes a variety of clinical presentations. The incidence of nocardiosis varies geographically according to several factors, such as the prevalence of HIV infections, transplants, neoplastic and rheumatic diseases, as well as climate, socio-economic conditions and laboratory procedures for Nocardia detection and identification. In Brazil the paucity of clinical reports of Nocardia infections suggests that this genus may be underestimated as a cause of human diseases and/or either neglected or misidentified in laboratory specimens. Accurate identification of Nocardia species has become increasingly important for clinical and epidemiological investigations. In this study, seven clinical Nocardia isolates were identified by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and their antimicrobial susceptibility was also determined. Most Nocardia isolates were associated to pulmonary disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS: The majority of Brazilian human isolates in cases reported in literature were identified as Nocardia sp. Molecular characterization was used for species identification of Nocardia nova, Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia asiatica and Nocardia exalbida/gamkensis. Data indicated that molecular analysis provided a different Nocardia speciation than the initial biochemical identification for most Brazilian isolates. All Nocardia isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobial of choice in the treatment nocardiosis. N. nova isolated from different clinical specimens from one patient showed identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and two distinct clones. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country in terms of land mass and population, pulmonary, extrapulmonary and systemic forms of nocardiosis were reported in only 6 of the 26 Brazilian states from 1970 to 2013. A least 33.8% of these 46 cases of nocardiosis proved fatal. Interestingly, coinfection by two clones may occur in patients presenting nocardiosis. Nocardia infection may be more common throughout the Brazilian territory and in other developing tropical countries than is currently recognized and MLSA should be used more extensively as an effective method for Nocardia identification."

TITLE:Pulmonary Nocardiosis Caused by Nocardia exalbida in a Patient with Lung Cancer and Radiation Pneumonitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.
ABSTRACT:We report a case of Nocardia exalbida (N.exalbida)-induced pneumonia in a 70-year old Japanese man with lung cancer and radiation pneumonitis. He initially received doripenem (1.5 g/day) for pneumonia treatment, and N.exalbida was identified by a clone library analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the pneumonia lesion. The doripenem dosage was therefore increased to 3.0 g/day with adjunctive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and his pneumonia improved. N. exalbida is susceptible to antibiotics; thus, in nocardiosis, N. exalbida infection might be associated with a good response to treatment, although its clinical findings are non-specific and similar to those of other Nocardia infections.

TITLE:Pulmonary nocardiosis caused by Nocardia exalbida mimicking lung cancer.
ABSTRACT:Nocardiosis is an uncommon infection caused by Nocardia species, but it can often occur in immunocompromised patients. As computed tomography (CT) findings of pulmonary nocardiosis, consolidation, masses, and nodules are often found, but lymph node enlargement is infrequent. Nocardia exalbida was first isolated in 2006, and there are still few reports on this microorganism. We report a case of pulmonary nocardiosis caused by N. exalbida presenting as a mass and lymph node enlargement that mimicked lung cancer. A 76-year-old man was referred and admitted to our hospital because of persistent cough, sputum production, and chest discomfort. Chest CT showed a mass in the superior segment of the left upper lobe and mediastinal lymph node enlargement. After we performed bronchoscopies, Nocardia species was isolated in a cultured specimen and identified as N. exalbida. This case required differentiation from lung cancer and was difficult to diagnose.

TITLE:Nocardia shimofusensis sp. nov., isolated from soil, and Nocardia higoensis sp. nov., isolated from a patient with lung nocardiosis in Japan.
ABSTRACT:Three actinomycete strains isolated from soils and one strain isolated from a patient with lung nocardiosis in 1999 and 2001 in Japan have been provisionally assigned to the genus Nocardia on the basis of morphological criteria. These isolates were further investigated to determine their specific taxonomic status. Detailed chemotaxonomic characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of these isolates confirmed that they belong to the genus Nocardia. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the four strains were most similar to that of Nocardia farcinica. However, the sequence similarity values between these four strains and N. farcinica were &lt;98.9 %. These four strains were susceptible to 5-fluorouracil, and they have the ability to decompose urea, which is a very characteristic trait. Furthermore, DNA-DNA relatedness data revealed that IFM 10311(T), IFM 10312 and IFM 10313 comprise a single novel species of Nocardia, that IFM 10084(T) represents another novel species of Nocardia and that these two novel species could be distinguished from N. farcinica. The names Nocardia shimofusensis sp. nov. and Nocardia higoensis sp. nov. are proposed, with IFM 10311(T) (=NBRC 100134(T)=JCM 12122(T)=DSM 44733(T)) and IFM 10084(T) (=NBRC 100133(T)=JCM 12121(T)=DSM 44732(T)) as the respective type strains."

TITLE:First case report of pulmonary nocardiosis caused by Nocardia mexicana.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Nocardia species usually cause opportunistic infections, and the frequency of these infections is increasing owing to the growing population of immunocompromised hosts. However, Nocardia species may sometimes cause an infection disease in immunocompetent hosts. Nocardia mexicana infections are the least common and are very rare. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report the first case of a pulmonary infection with N. mexicana in a 61-year-old Japanese woman with a history of hyperlipidaemia and bronchiectasis and a 6-month history of non-productive hacking cough. A sample of bronchial lavage fluid obtained by bronchofiberscopy showed filamentous branching gram-positive rods and acid-fast filamentous branching rods, and a colony of suspected Nocardia was cultured. Based on 16S rRNA, gyrB,rpoB, secA1 and hsp65 gene sequence analyses and biochemical and physiological properties, the strain was identified as N. mexicana. The strain was resistant to the antimicrobial agents amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, minocycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient was treated with biapenem followed by intravenous amikacin and oral linezolid. 
CONCLUSION: Despite its rarity, the species require attention owing to the existence of multidrug-resistant strains.

TITLE:First case report of pulmonary and cutaneous nocardiosis caused by Nocardia mexicana in Iran.
ABSTRACT:Background: Nocardia are aerobic partially acid-fast bacteria that are environmentally ubiquitous. This group of bacteria causes a rare bacterial infection of either the lungs (pulmonary) or body (systemic) that usually affects immunocompromised individuals. Nocardia mexicana was first isolated in 2004 from a patient with chronic bronchitis. However, there have been few reports on the clinical significance of this organism up to now. We herein report the first cases of N. mexicana in patients with pulmonary and cutaneous infection from Iran. Case presentation: A 57-year-old man was admitted to hospital due to a cutaneous wound on his left foot, fever, weakness, persistent cough and chest pain. At first, due to clinical examination and laboratory test, the patient was diagnosed as having tuberculosis. However, PCR of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative from broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples. Direct PCR of BAL was performed for this patient and according to the clinical examinations and microbiological evaluations; the micro-organism was identified as N. mexicana and was isolated from both BAL and the wound. Finally, the patient was treated with linezolid and amikacin. Conclusion: The infections, with actinomycetes such as Nocardia , are easily neglected or misdiagnosed due to the fastidious nature of the organism and the inadequate microbiological experience of laboratories in the hospitals of developing countries. This case shows that hospitals should consider a better laboratory protocol to deal with the clinical cases in which fastidious organisms, and in particular Nocardia , are involved.

TITLE:Nocardia mikamii sp. nov., isolated from human pulmonary infections in the USA.
ABSTRACT:Four nocardioform bacterial strains isolated from clinical respiratory sources were characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, these strains were found to be 100 % similar to each other and were shown to belong to the genus Nocardia. Chemotaxonomic data [major menaquinone: omega-cyclic isoprene side chain MK-8(H4(cycl)); major polar lipids: diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannosides; major fatty acids: monounsaturated fatty acids with a considerable amount of tuberculostearic acid; and mycolic acids (52-62 carbon atoms)] were consistent with the assignment of the novel strains to the genus Nocardia. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the novel strains were related to Nocardia cerradoensis DSM 44546(T) (99.8 %) and Nocardia aobensis JCM 12352(T) (99.6 %). Analysis of gyrB gene sequences showed these strains were related to N. aobensis (96.6 %) and to N. cerradoensis (96.3 %). The results suggest that gyrB gene sequencing is a more powerful tool than 16S rRNA gene sequencing for taxonomic identification within the genus Nocardia. DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests supported the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the novel strains from related species. These data indicated that the new strains represent a novel species within the genus Nocardia, for which the name Nocardia mikamii sp. nov. is proposed, with strain W8061(T) (=DSM 45174(T)=JCM 15508(T)) as the type strain."

TITLE:[Antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical Nocardia isolates identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis].
ABSTRACT:Nocardia species are ubiquitous in the environment and responsible for various human infections such as pulmonary, cutaneous, central nervous system and disseminated nocardiosis. Since the clinical pictures and antimicrobial susceptibilities of Nocardia species exhibit variability, susceptibility testing is recommended for every Nocardia isolates. The aims of this study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Nocardia clinical isolates and to compare the results of broth microdilution and disc diffusion susceptibility tests. A total of 45 clinical Nocardia isolates (isolated from 17 respiratory tract, 8 brain abscess, 7 pus, 3 skin, 3 conjunctiva, 2 blood, 2 tissue, 2 pleural fluid and 1 cerebrospinal fluid samples) were identified by using conventional methods and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Susceptibility testing was performed for amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, linezolid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria recommended in 2011 approved standard (M24-A2) and disk diffusion method used as an alternative comparative susceptibility testing method. Among the 45 Nocardia strains, N.cyriacigeorgica (n: 26, 57.8%) was the most common species, followed by N.farcinica (n: 12, 26.7%), N.otitiscaviarum (n: 4, 8.9%), N.asteroides (n: 1, 2.2%), N.neocaledoniensis (n: 1, 2.2%) and N.abscessus (n: 1, 2.2%). Amikacin and linezolid were the only two antimicrobials to which all isolates were susceptible for both broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests. In broth microdilution test, resistance rates to TMP-SMX, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were found as 15.6%, 37.8% and 84.4% respectively, whereas in the disk diffusion test, the highest resistance rate was observed against ciprofloxacin (n: 33, 73.3%), followed by TMP-SMX (n: 22, 48.9%) and ceftriaxone (n: 15, 33.3%). In both of these tests, N.cyriacigeorgica was the species with the highest resistance to ciprofloxacin (n: 25, 96.2%). When the susceptibility test results were compared, amikacin (kappa= 1), linezolid (kappa= 1), and ceftriaxone (kappa= 0.903) showed very good agreement, whereas ciprofloxacin showed good agreement (kappa= 0.672). For TMP-SMX no agreement was found between the two test methods (kappa= 0.092). In conclusion, due to the identification of different species with molecular methods and increased frequency of Nocardia infections in recent years, in vitro susceptibility testing for Nocardia species is important to guide the appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

摘要:诺卡菌在环境中普遍存在，可引起肺部、皮肤、中枢神经系统和播散性诺卡菌病等多种人类感染。由于诺卡菌种类的临床图像和抗菌药物敏感性表现出变异性，建议对每个诺卡菌分离株进行敏感性试验。本研究的目的是确定临床分离的诺卡菌的抗菌药物敏感性，并比较微量肉汤稀释和纸片扩散试验的结果。采用常规方法和16S rRNA基因序列分析方法对45例临床分离的诺卡菌(分离自17个呼吸道、8个脑脓肿、7个脓液、3个皮肤、3个结膜、2个血液、2个组织、2个胸膜液和1个脑脊液)进行鉴定。敏测试了阿米卡星、环丙沙星、头孢曲松钠、甲氧苄氨嘧啶linezolid和汤采用方法(使用)根据临床和实验室标准协会(CLSI)标准推荐2011年批准的标准(M24-A2)和磁盘扩散法作为一种比较敏测试方法。45株诺卡菌中，cyriacigeorgica (n: 26, 57.8%)最为常见，其次是farcinica (n: 12, 26.7%)、otitiscaviarum (n: 4, 8.9%)、asteroides (n: 1, 2.2%)、new ocaledoniensis (n: 1, 2.2%)和脓肿n: 1, 2.2%。阿米卡星和利奈唑胺是所有分离株均对微量肉汤稀释和纸片扩散试验敏感的两种抗菌药物。微量肉汤稀释法对三氯乙烷- smx、头孢曲松和环丙沙星的耐药率分别为15.6%、37.8%和84.4%，而纸片扩散法对环丙沙星的耐药率最高(33、73.3%)，其次是三氯乙烷- smx(22、48.9%)和头孢曲松(15、33.3%)。在这两种试验中，cyriacigeorgica对环丙沙星的抗性最高(n: 25,96.2%)。比较药敏试验结果，阿米卡星(kappa= 1)、利奈唑胺(kappa= 1)、头孢曲松(kappa= 0.903)与环丙沙星(kappa= 0.672)具有很好的一致性。对于TMP-SMX，两种测试方法没有发现一致(kappa= 0.092)。综上所示，由于近年来诺卡菌的感染频率不断增加，分子鉴定方法对不同种类的诺卡菌进行体外药敏试验对指导合理的抗菌治疗具有重要意义。"

ABSTRACT:This is so far the first published case report of a Nocardia paucivorans infection in an immunocompetent patient. A 54-year-old farmer was hospitalised with a history of coughing and fever for a period of five months. There was no indicator of either primary of secondary immunodeficiency in the prior medical history. A chest X-ray showed pneumonic infiltrates in the right middle und lower lobes, which progressed despite of antibiotic therapy with macrolides. A transbronchial biopsy revealed unspecific granulomatous inflammation of soft tissues. N. paucivorans - grew in cultures of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial biopsy. Oral antibiotic therapy was started with trimethoprime-sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. Susceptibility testing revealed high level resistance to TMP/SMX, which was consequently replaced by ciprofloxacin. Six months later, infiltrates had completely resolved and the patient did not report any residual clinical symptoms. The present case showed once again that nocardiosis is not limited to patients with immunodeficiencies. However, conservative combination therapy with oral antibiotics seems to be sufficiently effective for nocardiosis in the immunocompetent patient. For cases of suspected nocardiosis, a step-wise, risk-based diagnostic and therapeutic procedure is proposed."

ABSTRACT:Nocardia paucivorans is a recently discovered species that has been shown to have a predilection for CNS involvement in cases of disseminated infection. We present a 50-year-old man with one year of weight loss admitted to the hospital with cough and confusion. Imaging revealed pulmonary and iliopsoas masses as well as innumerable ring-enhancing brain lesions. N. paucivorans was eventually identified in a subcarinal lymph node biopsy. The diagnosis was expedited by utilizing 16s rRNA gene sequencing on the biopsy tissue, resulting in species-level identification several weeks prior to culture positivity. He was treated with 12 months of parenteral and oral antibiotics, with resolution of pulmonary and brain lesions on repeat imaging. "

TITLE:Nocardia donostiensis sp. nov., isolated from human respiratory specimens.
ABSTRACT:Three human clinical isolates (X1654, X1655, and W9944) were recovered from the sputum and bronchial washings of two patients with pulmonary infections. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the isolates showed that they share 100 % sequence similarity with each other and belong to the genus Nocardia. Close phylogenetic neighbours are Nocardia brevicatena ATCC 15333(T) (98.6 %) and Nocardia paucivorans ATCC BAA-278T (98.4 %). The in silico DNA-DNA relatedness between the isolates ranges from 96.8 to 100 % suggesting that they belong to the same genomic species. The DNA-DNA relatedness between X1654 and N. brevicatena ATCC 15333(T) is 13.3 +- 2.3 % and N. paucivorans ATCC BAA-278T is 18.95 +- 1.1 % suggesting that they do not belong to the same genomic species. Believed to represent a novel species, these isolates were further characterised to establish their taxonomic standing within the genus. Chemotaxonomic data for isolate X1654 are consistent with those described for the genus Nocardia: this isolate produced saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, tuberculostearic acid (15.9 %), the major menaquinone was MK-8 (H4cyclic), mycolic acid chain lengths ranged from 38 to 58 carbons, produced meso-diaminopimelic acid with arabinose, glucose, and galactose as the whole cell sugars. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. The DNA G+C content is 66.7 mol  %. Based on the combination of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genotypic data for X1654, X1655, and W9944, we conclude that these isolates represent a novel species within the genus Nocardia for which we propose the name Nocardia donostiensis sp. nov. with X1654(T) (=DSM 46814(T) = CECT 8839(T)) as the type strain.

TITLE:Nocardia spp. Pneumonia in a Solid Organ Recipient: Role of Linezolid.
ABSTRACT:We describe a rare infection with Nocardia spp. (N. pseudobrasiliensis species identification based on high-performance liquid chromatography analysis) in a 68-year-old renal transplant recipient. He presented with pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure. He was allergic to sulphonamides. He was initially successfully treated with linezolid. However, he suffered severe sensory neuropathy after 4 months of therapy, necessitating linezolid cessation and completion of treatment with azithromycin. He had clinical and radiological resolution of his pneumonia and was disease free at subsequent follow-up 4 years later. This case highlights the need for alternative therapies for nocardiosis for patients that cannot be treated with sulphonamides due to allergies or/and infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens. It also illustrates the treatment limiting side effects of long-term therapy with linezolid.

TITLE:Clinical features, identification, antimicrobial resistance patterns of Nocardia species in China: 2009-2017.
ABSTRACT:Nocardia spp. is a pathogen responsible for a variety of clinical infections, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections, to the respiratory tract and central nervous system infections. Its epidemiological characteristics, including species distribution, clinical features, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, should be under surveillance for the prevention and treatment of nocardiosis. In the present study, over a 9-year period (from 2009 to 2017), 53 non-repetitive Nocardia isolates were collected from 8 tertiary general hospitals of 7 cities in China. These isolates were identified to species level by multilocus sequence analysis(MLSA). The clinical data were also reviewed. The susceptibilities to 10 commonly-used antibiotics for Nocardia were determined by E-test stripes, and the resistance rates, MIC50 and MIC90 to each antibiotic by different species were analyzed. Of 53 Nocardia isolates, N. farcinica was the most common species (24.5%, 13/53), followed by N. cyriacigeorgica (20.8%, 11/53), N. terpenica (15.1%, 8/53), N. abscessus (9.43%, 5/53), N. otitidiscaviarum (7.55%, 4/53), respectively. Furthermore, 31 Nocardia (58.5%) isolates were recovered from lower respiratory tract (sputum and BALF), 15 (28.3%) from superficial Infection, 3 (5.7%) from pleural effusion, 2 (3.8%) from CSF, and 1 from bone marrow and 1 from synovial fluid, respectively. The antibiotic resistance profiles varied between different Nocardia species. All Nocardia isolates were susceptible to linezolid, followed by imipenem and amikacin (both 92.5% susceptibility rate). N. terpenica, rarely documented elsewhere, showed a different antimicrobial susceptibility profile. In summary, herein, the clinical and antibiotic resistance features of Nocardia species reported would be helpful for understanding the diversity of Nocardia species circulating in China and for decision making in the context of empiric therapy.

TITLE:[Microbiological and clinical features of nine cases with nocardial infections].
ABSTRACT:Following recent advance in medical technology, the increase of immunocompromised patients results in an increase of opportunistic infections such as nocardiosis. However, little is known about relationships between clinical features of nocardial infections and each Nocardia species, especially newly identified ones. Therefore, we identified clinical isolates of Nocardia species by genetic methods and analyzed clinical features of nocardiosis. Nine clinical isolates were obtained in Kyushu University Hospital from 2005 to 2008. Six different Nocardia species were identified by 16Sr RNA: Nocardiafarcinia (n=2), Nocardia brasiliensis (n=2), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia transvalensis (n=1), Nocardia araoensis (n=1) and Nocardia testacea (n=1). The underlying diseases of 9 patients were pulmonary diseases(n=5), malignant diseases(n=3), collagen diseases(n=1) or primary immunodeficiency diseases (n=l). According to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, none of them was resistant to minocycline or linezolid. Among seven isolates from respiratory specimens, one was resistant to imipenem, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amikacin, two were to ciprofloxacin. Three species identified recently (N cyriacigeorgica, N. araoensis and N. testacea) were involved in this study and most of them were considered as infectious pathogens to human. These data suggested the identification of Nocardia to the species level and susceptibility testing were important for diagnosis as infectious diseases and treatments."

TITLE:Molecular identification and susceptibility pattern of clinical Nocardia species: Emergence of Nocardia crassostreae as an agent of invasive nocardiosis.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Nocardia species are rare, opportunistic organisms that cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. 
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents. 
METHODS: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. 
RESULTS: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. DISCUSSION: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. 
CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections. Nocardiosis manifests various clinical features depending on the Nocardia species and underlying conditions."

TITLE:Epidemiology and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of the main Nocardia species in Spain.
ABSTRACT:Objectives: The aims of this study were to explore the clinical distribution, by species, of the genus Nocardia and to assess the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the 10 most prevalent species identified in Spain. Methods: Over a 10 year period (2005-14), 1119 Nocardia strains were molecularly identified and subjected to the Etest. The distribution and resistance trends over the sub-periods 2005-09 and 2010-14 were also examined. Results: Of the strains examined, 82.9% belonged to the following species: Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (25.3%), Nocardia nova (15.0%), Nocardia abscessus (12.7%), Nocardia farcinica (11.4%), Nocardia carnea (4.3%), Nocardia brasiliensis (3.5%), Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (3.1%), Nocardia flavorosea (2.6%), Nocardia rhamnosiphila (2.6%) and Nocardia transvalensis (2.4%). Their prevalence values were similar during 2005-09 and 2010-14, except for those of N. abscessus , N. farcinica and N. transvalensis , which fell significantly in the second sub-period ( P &lt;=  0.05). The major location of isolation was the respiratory tract (~86%). Half (13/27) of all strains from the CNS were N. farcinica . Significant differences in MIC results were recorded for some species between the two sub-periods. According to the CLSI's breakpoints, low resistance rates (&lt;=15%) were recorded for seven species with respect to cefotaxime, imipenem and tobramycin; five species showed similar rates with respect to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Linezolid and amikacin were the most frequently active agents. Conclusion: The accurate identification of the infecting species and the determination of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, given the large number of strains with atypical patterns, are crucial if patients with nocardiosis are to be successfully treated.

TITLE:Nocardia veterana, a new emerging pathogen.
ABSTRACT:Nocardia veterana is a newly described species named after the veteran's hospital where it was first isolated. This initial type strain was not thought to be clinically significant. We describe three cases of pulmonary disease attributable to N. veterana: two cases in patients presenting with multiple pulmonary nodules in a setting of immunocompromise and one case of exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease. The isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and had reduced susceptibilities to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin. The MICs of amoxicillin-clavulanate were higher than that of ampicillin alone, and the bacteria produced a beta-lactamase detectable only after induction with clavulanic acid. Phenotypically, the isolates could not be characterized beyond the Nocardia genus level. All three isolates were definitively identified as N. veterana by PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. On the basis of their susceptibility and restriction enzyme analysis profiles, our findings indicate that they could potentially be misidentified as N. nova. These cases illustrate the pathogenic potential of this newly described species and emphasize the importance of accurate identification of Nocardia isolates to the species level by integrated use of phenotypic and genotypic methods."

The isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and had reduced susceptibilities to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin. The MICs of amoxicillin-clavulanate were higher than that of ampicillin alone, and the bacteria produced a beta-lactamase detectable only after induction with clavulanic acid. Phenotypically, the isolates could not be characterized beyond the Nocardia genus level. All three isolates were definitively identified as N. veterana by PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. On the basis of their susceptibility and restriction enzyme analysis profiles, our findings indicate that they could potentially be misidentified as N. nova. These cases illustrate the pathogenic potential of this newly described species and emphasize the importance of accurate identification of Nocardia isolates to the species level by integrated use of phenotypic and genotypic methods."

TITLE:Nocardia veterana as a pathogen in North American patients.
ABSTRACT:The molecular methodologies used in our laboratories have allowed us to define a group of Nocardia isolates from clinical samples which resemble the type strain of Nocardia veterana. Three patient isolates and the type strain of N. veterana gave identical and distinctive restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for an amplified portion of the 16S rRNA gene. These three isolates and the N. veterana type strain also gave identical RFLPs for an amplified portion of the 65-kDa heat shock protein gene, but this pattern was identical to that obtained for the Nocardia nova type strain. Sequence analysis of both a 1,359-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene and a 441-bp region of the heat shock protein gene of the patient isolates showed 100% identities with the same regions of the N. veterana type strain. DNA-DNA hybridization of the DNA of one of the patient isolates with the DNA of the N. veterana type strain showed a relative binding ratio of 82%, with 0% divergence, confirming that the isolate was N. veterana. Biochemical and susceptibility testing showed no significant differences among the patient isolates and the N. veterana type strain. Significantly, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing obtained for our isolates were similar to those obtained for N. nova, indicating that susceptibility testing alone cannot discriminate between these species. We present two case studies which show that N. veterana is a causative agent of pulmonary disease in immunocompromised patients residing in North America. We also describe difficulties encountered in using 16S rRNA gene sequences alone for discrimination of N. veterana from the related species Nocardia africana and N. nova because of the very high degree of 16S rRNA gene similarity among them."

TITLE:Nocardiosis at the turn of the century.
ABSTRACT:Nocardia species is an uncommon pathogen that affects both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. The clinical and microbiologic spectrum of nocardiosis has changed recently due to the widespread use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, the emergence of new types of immunosuppressed patients, and the improved identification of isolates using molecular techniques. Nocardia asteroides was traditionally considered the predominant organism, and prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole was considered almost universally protective. We conducted the current study to determine the incidence of nocardiosis and its microbiologic and clinical characteristics in a general hospital over the last 12 years. We reviewed the clinical records of all patients in whom Nocardia species was isolated from clinical specimens between 1995 and 2006. Nocardia isolates were identified by standard procedures and by 5' end 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Susceptibility to cotrimoxazole, minocycline, imipenem, linezolid, and amikacin was determined by the broth microdilution method following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.The incidence of Nocardia infections did not increase significantly during the study period (0.39/100,000 inhabitants in 1995-1998 and 0.55/100,000 inhabitants in 2003-2006). Nocardia was recovered from 43 patients. Six were considered to be colonized. The colonizing species were N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. asteroides. All colonized patients had severe underlying pulmonary conditions and were treated with antimicrobials (6 patients) or corticosteroids (4 patients). Invasive nocardiosis was diagnosed in 37 patients (86.5% were men, and their mean age was 55.8 +/- 17.3 yr). The most common underlying condition in our institution was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (10 patients; 27%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8 patients; 21.6%), autoimmune diseases (8 patients; 21.6%), solid organ transplantation (7 patients; 18.9%), and cancer (4 patients; 10.8%). The most important risk factor for nocardiosis was corticosteroid administration (23 patients; 62.2%). Nocardiosis affected the lungs in 26 cases (70.3%), the skin in 3 cases (8.1%), and the central nervous system in 2 cases (5.4%). It was disseminated in 5 cases (13.5%) and caused otomastoiditis in 1 (2.7%). The species identified were N. cyriacigeorgica (32.4%), N. farcinica (24.3%), N. otitidiscaviarum (10.8%), N. veterana (8.1%), N. nova (5.4%), N. abscessus (5.4%), N. asiatica (2.7%), N. beijingensis (2.7%), N. brasiliensis (2.7%), N. carnea (2.7%), and Nocardia species (2.7%).Linezolid and amikacin were uniformly active against all the isolates, whereas 29.7% of isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to minocycline (minimum inhibitory concentration = 2 mg/L), 10.8% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, and 5.4% were resistant to imipenem. Nocardiosis occurred while the patients were on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 8 cases (21.6%). The strains isolated from these patients were susceptible to cotrimoxazole in 5 cases (62.5%) and resistant in 3 (37.5%). Overall, 13 patients died (35.1%); related mortality was 21.6% (8 patients). We conclude that HIV infection has become the most common underlying condition for invasive nocardiosis in our institution, followed by chronic lung disease. Previous use of corticosteroids was the main risk factor and was present in more than half the patients. New species of Nocardia have been identified, and administration of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should no longer be considered highly reliable protection against nocardiosis. Larger studies of nocardiosis are required to better identify risk factors associated with mortality, and alternative and more effective methods of prevention must be developed."

ABSTRACT:This study aimed to clarify the taxonomic position of an actinomycete isolated from an HIV-positive male patient with pulmonary complications in Asir, southern region of Saudi Arabia. The strain was found to have phenotypic properties typical of nocardiae and 16S rRNA gene analysis clustered the isolate with Nocardia wallacei (accession KC677696) in the phylogenetic branch of the amikacin resistance Nocardia transvalensis complex. We consider that nocardiosis is usually missed or misdiagnosed clinically and recognition of these bacteria based on phenotypic tests is strenuous, but definitive identification is attainable by molecular methods."

TITLE:A complicated case of an immunocompetent patient with disseminated nocardiosis.
ABSTRACT:Nocardia species are aerobic, gram positive filamentous branching bacteria that have the potential to cause localized or disseminated infection. Nocardiosis is a rare disease that usually affects immunocompromised patients and presents as either pulmonary, cutaneous or disseminated nocardiosis. Forty-two year-old hispanic male presented to our care with bilateral lower extremity weakness, frontal headache, subjective fever, nausea, and vomiting. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple hyperdense lesions with vasogenic edema in the frontal, parietal and left temporal lobes. Chest CT demonstrated bilateral cavitary nodules in the lung and right hilar lymphadenopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple bilateral supratentorial and infratentorial rim enhancing lesions involving the subcortical gray-white matter interface with vasogenic edema. Patient was started on empiric therapy for unknown infectious etiology with no response. He eventually expired and autopsy findings revealed a right hilar lung abscess and multiple brain abscesses. Microscopic and culture findings from tissue sample during autopsy revealed nocardia wallacei species with multidrug resistance. The cause of death was stated as systemic nocadiosis (nocardia pneumonitis and encephalitis). The presence of simultaneous lung and brain abscesses is a reliable indication of an underlying Nocardia infection. An increased awareness of the various presentations of nocardiosis and a high index of clinical suspicion can help in a rapid diagnosis and improve survival in an otherwise fatal disease. This case highlights the importance of obtaining a tissue biopsy for definitive diagnosis on the initial presentation when an infectious process is considered in the differential diagnosis and early treatment can be initiated.

TITLE:Clinical significance, antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular identification of Nocardia species isolated from children with cystic fibrosis.
ABSTRACT:Nocardia is an opportunistic pathogen that causes respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology, clinical significance and antimicrobial susceptibility of Nocardia species isolated from eight children with cystic fibrosis. The isolated species were identified as Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia transvalensis, Nocardia pneumoniae, Nocardia veterana and Nocardia wallacei. N. farcinica was isolated in three patients and all of them presented lung affectation with a chronic colonization and pneumonia. N. farcinica showed resistance against gentamicin, tobramycin, cefotaxime, but was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amikacin. N. transvalensis, which was isolated from two patients, showed an association with chronic colonization. N. transvalensis was resistant to tobramycin and amikacin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefotaxime. N. veterana, N. pneumoniae and N. wallacei were isolated from three different patients and appeared in transitory lung colonization. N. veterana and N. pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, tobramycin, and cefotaxime. N. wallacei was resistant to amikacin, tobramycin, imipenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. All the isolates were identified up to species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The presence of Nocardia in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis is not always an indication of an active infection; therefore, the need for a treatment should be evaluated on an individual basis. The detection of multidrug-resistant species needs molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections.

TITLE:Specific clinical manifestations of Nocardia: A case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:Nocardiosis is a rare bacterial infection of either the lungs (pulmonary) or body (systemic) that usually affects immunocompromised individuals. It is caused by Gram-positive, aerobic actinomycetes of the Nocardia genus. Multiple high-density sheet shadows in both lungs along with nodules or cavities are the most common presentations of nocardiosis, whereas a large pulmonary mass is considered to be rare. However, there is no specificity in the clinical manifestation of the disease. Therefore, isolation and identification of Nocardia strains is the only reliable diagnostic method. The present study describes the cases of two male patients of Asian descent with nocardiosis. Chest computed tomography scans showed a suspected tumor mass in both patients. Microscopic analysis and culturing of tissue samples obtained using a bronchoscope detected the presence of Nocardia wallacei. Neither patient showed signs of immunosuppression. The present study aimed to improve the understanding of lung nocardiosis and demonstrated that pulmonary nocardiosis should be suspected in the case of non-immunocompromised patients with a large mass in the lung. Furthermore, a review of the literature on infection with Nocardia was conducted.

TITLE:Rare, suppurative pulmonary infection caused by Nocardiopsis dassonvillei recognized by glycolipid markers.
ABSTRACT:An opportunistic actinomycete was isolated as the only etiological agent of a severe, suppurative pulmonary infection. The strain was rapidly recognised as Nocardiopsis by the taxonomically important and immunologically active glycolipid markers (G1 and G2). Identification of the clinical isolate, from a group of actinomycetes mainly known as soil habitants, was definitely proved by chemotaxonomic studies (cell wall/sugar, phospholipid and fatty acid types) as well as by genomic data (GC content, DNA-DNA reassociation). The level of DNA-DNA homology of the clinical actinomycete, in comparison with other reference members of this genus, revealed the highest (88%) relatedness to Nocardiopsis dassonvillei. The results confirmed the value and generic specificity of glycolipid markers from Nocardiopsis, the first time used for rapid recognition of a clinical strain causing a nocardiosis-like disease."

TITLE:Identification and characterization of non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolated from tuberculosis suspects in Southern-central China.
ABSTRACT:The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)-related death has increased globally recently. To obtain information of the species and characterization of pathogens involved in NTM pulmonary infection in Southern-central China, we identified 160 non-tuberculous infection cases from 3995 acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive tuberculous suspects. We then randomly selected 101 non-tuberculous patients, isolated bacteria from their sputa and genotyped the pathogens using the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequences. M. intracellulare (32.67%, 33/101), M. abscessus (32.67%, 33/101) and M. fortuitum (7.92%, 8/101) are identified in these isolates. Surprisingly, non-mycobacteria including Gordonia (8.91%, 9/101), Nocardia (5.94%, 6/101) and Tsukamurella (0.99%, 1/101) are also discovered, and the case of Tsukamurella pulmonis infection is first discovered in Southern-central China. Moreover, species of M. mucogenicum group, M. chubuense, M. kansasii, M. gastri, M. avium, M. porcinum and M. smegmatis are identified. In addition, nine immune compromised cases (8.91%, 9/101), including type two diabetes mellitus and HIV/AIDS are found to be infected with non-tuberculous bacteria. This study revealed the distribution and characteristics of non-tuberculous AFB pathogen infection occurred in Southern-central China, and suggested that physicians should be alert of the emerging of NTM and non-mycobacteria infection in AFB positive cases and take caution when choosing chemotherapy for tuberculosis-like pulmonary infections. Generally, this study may help with the development of new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infection.

TITLE:A Novel Depsipeptide Produced by Paenibacillus alvei 32 Isolated from a Cystic fibrosis Patient.
ABSTRACT:The important viscosity of the respiratory tract mucus of Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients impairs the mucociliary transport system and allows the growth of numerous micro-organisms. Among them, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are known to be responsible for pulmonary infections. We imagined that CF microflora could also harbour micro-organisms naturally equipped to compete with these pathogens. A method was developed to recover these antibiotic-producing strains within 20 CF sputum. Using this approach, we have isolated an unusual Gram-positive bacterium identified as Paenibacillus alvei by Api galleries and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. This strain has inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in co-cultures. A liquid mineral medium named MODT50 was designed and optimised for the production and the recovery of the antimicrobial compounds. The supernatant has inhibited the growth of all Gram-positive strains tested, even Methicillin-resistant S. aureus. One antimicrobial compound with a peptide structure (mainly active against S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, and Pseudomonas stutzeri) has been purified and characterised by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The new active molecule (m/z 786.6) named depsipeptide L possesses a 15-guanidino-3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid side chain (m/z 298) linked on a cyclic part of four amino acids residues (Ser, two Leu/Ile, Arg). This work reports for the first time the production of such a molecule by a P. alvei strain in a mineral medium. The CF lung microflora might represent a valuable source for the discovery of new antimicrobial-producing strains.

TITLE:[A case of farmer's lung associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].
ABSTRACT:Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis are two forms of lung disease with presumed distinct immunoallergic mechanisms. We report the observation of a 38-year-old French farmer who, for one month, had fever and dyspnoea resistant to antibiotic therapy. A diagnosis of farmer's lung, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was made on clinical, biological, functional and radiological evidence and according to the criteria established. The evolution was favorable with antigenic eviction and corticosteroid therapy. This observation is to our knowledge the 5th case that describes the association of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

TITLE:Risk factors for symptoms of infection and microbial carriage among French medical students abroad.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: To investigate symptoms of infections and their risk factors among French medical students undertaking an internship abroad. 
METHODS: Clinical follow up and qPCR-based respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vaginal pathogen carriage were prospectively assessed pre-travel and post-travel, in a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France. 
RESULTS: 293 students were included. 63.5%, 35.8% and 3.6% of students reported gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and Enteropathogenic E. coli was 40.9% and 18.6%, respectively. A significant increase was observed for rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by comparing the prevalence of pathogens in pre-travel and post-travel samples. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 12.9% and 13.9%, respectively. Being female, primarily travelling to Vietnam, and living in basic accommodation conditions were independent risk factors for reporting respiratory symptoms. Students reporting respiratory symptoms were three times more likely to acquire S. pneumoniae. Travelling primarily to north India and Senegal were independent risk factors for diarrhoea. 
CONCLUSION: This study makes it possible to identify the main infectious diseases linked to travel in a group of French medical students undertaking an internship abroad and the risk factors on which to base targeting students for reinforced pre-travel advice.

TITLE:Detection of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of patients with HIV by Multiplex PCR Assay.
ABSTRACT:Background: Nocardia, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus are life threatening opportunistic pathogens under immunodeficiency conditions, particularly among patients infected with HIV. Rapid and accurate detection of these infections can improve immune health quality, patient management and appropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to design a novel multiplex-PCR assay for rapid diagnosis of these three organisms directly from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of patients infected with HIV. Methods: The genus specific primers were designed for direct-detection of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus in a single tube multiplex PCR. This PCR specifically amplified the target genes from pure cultures. It subsequently was applied on BAL specimens of 29 HIV positive patients that had previously been culture negative for actinomycete bacteria, of which Nocardia, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus are members. Results: Of 29 respiratory clinical specimens, there were positive for Nocardia spp. and one was positive for Streptomyces spp using the multiplex PCR assay. The sequencing of the PCR products identified the species as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (n=2), Nocardia farcinica and Streptomyces albus. Conclusion: This novel multiplex PCR assay yielded reliable results for accurate identification of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Rhodococcus from BAL while the results of bacterial culture were negative.

TITLE:Isolation, biochemical and molecular identification of Nocardia species among TB suspects in northeastern, Tanzania; a forgotten or neglected threat?
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nocardiosis mimic pulmonary tuberculosis in most clinical and radiological manifestations. In Tanzania, where tuberculosis is one of the major public health threat clinical impact of nocardiosis as the cause of the human disease remains unknown. The objective of the present study was to isolate and identify Nocardia isolates recovered from TB suspects in Northeastern, Tanzania by using biochemical and molecular methods. 
METHODS: The study involved 744 sputum samples collected from 372 TB suspects from four periphery diagnostic centers in Northeastern, Tanzania. Twenty patients were diagnosed as having presumptively Nocardia infections based on microscopic, cultural characteristics and biomerieux ID 32C Yeast Identification system and confirmed using 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene specific primers for Nocardia species and sequencing. 
RESULTS: Biochemically, the majority of the isolates were N. asteroides (n = 8/20, 40%), N. brasiliensis (n = 4/20, 20%), N. farcinica (n = 3/20, 15%), N. nova (n = 1/20, 5%). Other aerobic actinomycetales included Streptomyces cyanescens (n = 2/20, 10%), Streptomyces griseus, Actinomadura madurae each (n = 1/20, 5%). Results of 16S rRNA and hsp65 sequencing were concordant in 15/17 (88. 2%) isolates and discordant in 2/17 (11.8%) isolates. Majority of the isolates belonged to N. cyriacigeorgica and N. farcinica, four (23.5%) each. 
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Nocardia species may be an important cause of pulmonary nocardiosis that is underdiagnosed or ignored. This underscores needs to consider pulmonary nocardiosis as a differential diagnosis when there is a failure of anti-TB therapy and as a possible cause of human infections.

坦桑尼亚东北部地区结核疑似病例中诺卡菌的分离、生化和分子鉴定;一个被遗忘或忽视的威胁?
文摘:
背景:肺部诺卡氏菌病在大多数临床和放射学表现上与肺结核相似。在坦桑尼亚，结核病是主要的公共卫生威胁之一，诺卡氏菌病作为人类疾病病因的临床影响仍不清楚。本研究的目的是利用生化和分子方法分离和鉴定从坦桑尼亚东北部地区结核疑似病例中回收的诺卡菌。
方法:该研究涉及来自坦桑尼亚东北部4个周边诊断中心372名结核疑似患者的744份痰样本。根据显微镜、培养特征和biomerieux ID 32C酵母鉴定系统，20例患者被确诊为诺卡菌感染，并使用16S rRNA和hsp65基因特异性引物对诺卡菌种类进行鉴定和测序。
结果:从生物化学上看，分离株以菊苣苣苔(n = 8/ 20,40%)、巴西苣苔(n = 4/ 20,20%)、褐飞虱(n = 3/ 20,15%)、新苣苔苣苔(n = 1/ 20,5%)为主。其他需氧放线菌包括青链霉菌(Streptomyces cyananescens, n = 2/ 20,10%)、灰链霉菌(Streptomyces griseus, Actinomadura madurae, n = 1/ 20,5%)。16S rRNA与hsp65测序结果一致(88 /17)。2/17株分离株不一致(11.8%)。分离株主要属于cyriacigeorgica和farcinica，各4株(23.5%)。
结论:我们的发现表明诺卡菌种类可能是肺部诺卡菌病的一个重要原因，但诊断不足或被忽视。这强调需要考虑在抗结核治疗失败时将肺部诺卡氏菌病作为一种鉴别诊断，并作为人类感染的一种可能原因。"

TITLE:Septic pulmonary emboli caused by Tsukamurella inchonensis: A case report.
ABSTRACT:The genus Tsukamurella is a fastidious, environmental organism that potentially causes various infections in humans. Due to the morphological and biochemical similarities to others pathogens, such as Gordona, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, Nocardia, and Mycobacterium, a molecular-based approach is indispensable to correctly identify them. Herein, we describe a case of Tsukamurella inchonensis bacteremia complicated with septic pulmonary emboli (SPE), which is the first in the literature. A 44-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with tongue cancer had undergone partial tongue resection. While receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she developed high fever. Chest computed tomography suggested multiple emboli at the bilateral, peripheral lungs, indicating SPE. Blood culture detected Gram-positive rods, to which matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry failed to identify. Then, we attempted to characterize it by 16S rRNA sequence, which suggested the organism to be Tsukamurella species but resulted in low resonance of the species-level identification. Additionally, we employed a confidence gene targeting groEL, leading to 100% matching (753/753 bps) with T. inchonensis NCTC 10741 (GenBank accession no. LR131273.1), which has been incorrectly registered as wrong species name Tsukamurella paurometabola in the database. Under the diagnosis of T. inchonensis-associated SPE, we successfully treated the patient with imipenem/cilastatin administration for 4 weeks. Sequencing analysis of groEL was of great use in identifying the organism in this case. More clinical cases based on molecular diagnosis of the fastidious pathogens need to be accumulated to further understand the characteristics and appropriate treatment regimen.

摘要:Tsukamurella属是一种挑剔的环境微生物，可能会引起人类的各种感染。由于与其他病原菌如Gordona、Rhodococcus、棒状杆菌、Nocardia、分枝杆菌等在形态和生化上都有相似之处，因此要正确识别它们，分子方法是必不可少的。在这里，我们描述了一个病例的Tsukamurella inchonensis菌血症合并脓毒性肺栓塞(SPE)，这是第一个在文献中。一名44岁的日本妇女被诊断为舌癌，接受了部分舌切除术。在接受化疗和放疗期间，她开始发高烧。胸部电脑断层扫描显示双侧外周肺多发栓子，提示SPE。血培养检测到革兰氏阳性棒，基质辅助激光解吸/电离飞行时间质谱无法识别。然后，我们尝试用16S rRNA序列对其进行表征，表明该生物是Tsukamurella种，但在种级鉴定中共振较低。此外，我们使用了一个针对groEL的置信度基因，使其与T. inchonensis ntc 10741 (GenBank accession no. 753/753 bps) 100%匹配。LR131273.1)，已在数据库中错误注册为错误的物种名Tsukamurella paurometabola。在诊断为结核分枝杆菌相关SPE的情况下，我们成功地给予患者亚胺培南/西司他汀治疗4周。在这种情况下，groEL的测序分析在鉴定微生物方面有很大的用处。更多的临床病例需要在精细病原的分子诊断基础上积累，以进一步了解其特点和适当的治疗方案。"

ABSTRACT:The genus Tsukamurella belongs to the family Nocardiaceae, and is an environmental saprophyte. The type species is Tsukamurella paurometabola. Its microbiological identification and differentiation from the other species containing mycolic acids can be difficult. There has been a few cases of human infections reported, usually in patients with special conditions, such as chronic lung pathology, immuno-suppression (leukemia, solid tumors, maybe HIV-infection) or the long-term use of indwelling catheters. The treatment of choice, despite the lack of adequate guidelines, is an antibiotherapy combining a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside; catheter removal appears to be essential for cure."

TITLE:Coexistence of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung and Tsukamurella infection: a case report and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: A major diagnostic challenge in the evaluation of a cavitary lung lesion is to distinguish between infectious and malignant etiologies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of an elderly man presenting with fever, hemoptysis and a left upper lobe cavitary lesion. Serial sputum cultures grew Tsukamurella pulmonis, a rare pathogen associated with cavitary pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. However, despite clinical improvement with antibiotic therapy targeted to the organism, concomitant discovery of a papillary thyroid carcinoma led to a needle biopsy of the cavitary lesion, which showed evidence of primary lung adenocarcinoma. 
CONCLUSION: This is the first description of Tsukamurella infection in the setting of primary lung carcinoma. The report also illustrates the potential complex nature of cavitary lesions and emphasizes the need to consider the coexistence of malignant and infectious processes in all patients, especially those with risk factors for malignancy that fail to improve on antibiotic therapy."

TITLE:Identification and characterization of non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolated from tuberculosis suspects in Southern-central China.
ABSTRACT:The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)-related death has increased globally recently. To obtain information of the species and characterization of pathogens involved in NTM pulmonary infection in Southern-central China, we identified 160 non-tuberculous infection cases from 3995 acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive tuberculous suspects. We then randomly selected 101 non-tuberculous patients, isolated bacteria from their sputa and genotyped the pathogens using the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequences. M. intracellulare (32.67%, 33/101), M. abscessus (32.67%, 33/101) and M. fortuitum (7.92%, 8/101) are identified in these isolates. Surprisingly, non-mycobacteria including Gordonia (8.91%, 9/101), Nocardia (5.94%, 6/101) and Tsukamurella (0.99%, 1/101) are also discovered, and the case of Tsukamurella pulmonis infection is first discovered in Southern-central China. Moreover, species of M. mucogenicum group, M. chubuense, M. kansasii, M. gastri, M. avium, M. porcinum and M. smegmatis are identified. In addition, nine immune compromised cases (8.91%, 9/101), including type two diabetes mellitus and HIV/AIDS are found to be infected with non-tuberculous bacteria. This study revealed the distribution and characteristics of non-tuberculous AFB pathogen infection occurred in Southern-central China, and suggested that physicians should be alert of the emerging of NTM and non-mycobacteria infection in AFB positive cases and take caution when choosing chemotherapy for tuberculosis-like pulmonary infections. Generally, this study may help with the development of new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infection.

ABSTRACT:Chemotaxonomic and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analyses of four bacterial isolates from blood cultures from patients with cardiac pacemaker implants and sputa of patients with chronic lung infections clearly demonstrated that these bacteria belong to the genus Tsukamurella. DNA-DNA hybridization data, as well as the physiological characteristics of the isolates, indicate that they are closely related and belong to a single species that differs from previously described members of the genus Tsukamurella. The name Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens sp. nov. is proposed for these isolates, and the new species is represented by strain IMMIB D-1397T (= DSM 44234T). Strain IMMIB D-1397T exhibits 53.4, 53.5, and 54.7% DNA-DNA relatedness to Tsukamurella paurometabola DSM 20162T, Tsukamurella inchonensis DSM 44067T, and Tsukamurella pulmonis DSM 44142T, respectively."

ABSTRACT:A 79-year old woman underwent total gastrectomy under the diagnosis of gastric cancer in Feb. 2003. In the beginning of Jan. 2005, she noticed hemosputum and was admitted to our hospital. Chest radiograph and CT disclosed bilateral upper lobe-dominant nodular opacities in the subpleural areas and ground-glass opacities in right S6. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, but no useful information for the diagnosis was obtained. Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative for the smear of the sputum at admission, but weakly stained acid-fast bacilli were grown in the MGIT culture. By the analysis of mycolic acid and menaquinone of the cell membrane, the bacilli were identified as Tsukamurella. Since she was asymptomatic and repeated sputum examination revealed negative bacilli, she has been observed at the outpatient clinic without any treatment."

ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: We describe an immunocompromised patient with Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens bacteremia and coinfection of Mycobacterium bovis pneumonia. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of persistent fever with general malaise. His medical history showed that he had diabetes mellitus (HbA1C 9.2%). A chest computed tomography (CT) showed left upper lung consolidation . Two sets of blood culture at admission finally showed Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens. Moreover, three transbronchoscopy washing specimen cultures revealed Mycobacterium bovis. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The organism Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens was identified using conventional biochemical identification methods, PCR-restriction DNA fragment analysis, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The clinical mycobacterial isolates were identified to the species level by combining Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with an oligonucleotide microarray to detect the M. bovis amplicons. 
CONCLUSION: According to our literature review, our patient's case was the first of a coinfection with Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens and Mycobacterium bovis. Prolonged antibiotic treatment and underlying disease control are necessary for this type of patient.

题目:Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens菌血症合并牛分枝杆菌肺炎:病例报告和文献回顾。
摘要:简介:我们描述了一名免疫功能低下的患者，患有Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens菌血症和牛分枝杆菌肺炎合并感染。病例描述:一位75岁男性因持续发烧及全身不适而入院。病史:糖尿病(糖化血红蛋白9.2%)。胸部电脑断层显示左肺上部实变。入院时两组血培养结果显示为Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens。此外，三种经支气管镜冲洗标本培养均发现牛分枝杆菌。讨论和评价:采用常规生化鉴定方法、pcr限制性DNA片段分析和16S rRNA基因测序对Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens进行鉴定。应用聚合酶链反应(PCR)和寡核苷酸芯片技术检测牛分枝杆菌扩增子，鉴定临床分离的分枝杆菌。
结论:根据我们的文献回顾，我们的患者是第一例合并感染Tsukamurella酪溶菌和牛分枝杆菌。对这类患者需要长期的抗生素治疗和基础疾病控制。"

TITLE:Rice-Field Drowning-Associated Pneumonia in which Pseudomonas spp., Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cunninghamella sp. Are Isolated.
ABSTRACT:We herein report the case of an 84-year-old who developed pneumonia after drowning in a rice field. Besides Aspergillus fumigatus, many pathogens previously not reported in drowning-associated pneumonia (such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Nocardia niigatensis, and Cunninghamella sp.) were isolated from his sputum. He received sulbactam/ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, voriconazole, levofloxacin and liposomal amphotericin B, but died due to respiratory failure. Because the patient had drowned in a contaminated stagnant rice field and had multiple lung cavities, zygomycosis was suspected. This report provides invaluable information for the consideration of zygomycosis after an individual drowning in a rice field, even in an immunocompetent patient.

标题:分离出假单胞菌、烟曲霉和坎宁安菌的稻田溺水病相关肺炎。
摘要:我们报告一位84岁的老人在稻田溺水后发生肺炎的病例。除烟曲霉外，从他的痰液中分离出许多以前未报道的溺水相关性肺炎病原体(如荧光假单胞菌、恶臭假单胞菌、niigatensis诺卡菌和Cunninghamella sp.)。患者接受舒巴坦/氨苄西林、甲氧苄啶/磺胺甲恶唑、伏立康唑、左氧氟沙星、脂质体两性霉素B治疗，因呼吸衰竭死亡。由于病人是在受污染的积水稻田溺水，并有多个肺腔，怀疑接合菌病。本报告提供了宝贵的信息，供考虑一个人在稻田溺水后，甚至在一个有免疫能力的病人接合菌病。"
