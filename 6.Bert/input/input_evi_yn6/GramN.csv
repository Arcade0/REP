TITLE:Vibrio vulnificus infection in Taiwan: report of 28 cases and review of clinical manifestations and treatment.
ABSTRACT:From May 1985 through July 1990, 28 episodes of Vibrio vulnificus infection in 27 patients were encountered in five major hospitals in Taiwan. The ages of patients ranged from 19 to 76 years; the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. Eighteen episodes manifested as bacteremia and eight as wound infections alone. One patient each developed gastroenteritis and pneumonia after nearly drowning. Twenty-three patients exhibited skin manifestations. Twenty patients had underlying diseases. All patients were treated with antibiotics, and 14 also underwent some form of surgical treatment (incision and drainage, fasciotomy, debridement, or amputation). Thirteen of the 28 episodes were preceded by precipitating factors; most were due to ingestion of seafood or exposure of abraded skin to salt water. Ten of the 18 septicemic patients died--most within 48 hours of hospitalization. One patient without bacteremia who had a wound infection died. Results of in vitro susceptibility studies suggested that ampicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin would be effective. Susceptibility to aminoglycosides was observed for greater than 90% of isolates. We recommend combined therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside along with appropriate surgical therapy for the treatment of V. vulnificus infection."

TITLE:Pleural infection caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus, formerly CDC group DF-2.
ABSTRACT:An 80-year-old man with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia developed pneumonia and empyema due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus (formerly CDC group DF-2). No growth was detected in blood cultures, but the organism was identified from cultures of pleural fluid. The infection responded well to antibiotics and drainage via a chest tube. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical isolate of C. canimorsus from a pulmonary source. The absence of concurrent bacteremia raises the possibility that the lower respiratory tract can be the site of primary infection with this organism."

TITLE:Bacteremia in a long-term-care facility: a five-year prospective study of 163 consecutive episodes.
ABSTRACT:The clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes of 163 episodes of bacteremia occurring at a long-term-care facility were evaluated. The rate of nosocomial bacteremia increased from 0.20 to 0.36 cases/1,000 patient-days from 1985 to 1989; there was a parallel increase in the rate of all nosocomial infections combined. Bacteremia was documented in 6.5% of all hospital-acquired infections. The majority of isolates were gram-negative, and Providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative species. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent isolate; one-third of S. aureus strains were resistant to methicillin. Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 36 episodes (22%), 14 of which involved an enterococcal species. Portals of entry included the urinary tract (55%), the respiratory tract (11%), and soft tissue (9%). Overall mortality was 21.5%. Death was significantly associated with residence on the intermediate-care unit, the presence of a respiratory infection, a change in mental status, and relatively recent admission. Optimal management of bacterial infection in a long-term-care setting requires the availability of blood culture results. Initial decisions about antibiotic therapy should be made in light of the likelihood of infection with multiresistant organisms and of polymicrobial infection."

TITLE:Pseudomonas infections in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.
ABSTRACT:We identified and reviewed retrospectively all the cases of infection by Pseudomonas and related genera in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) who were hospitalized at our Institution over a 36-month period. We recorded 48 episodes of infection in 34 of 355 patients with AIDS, and in two of 73 patients with ARC: 25 pneumonias (9 community-acquired and 16 of nosocomial origin). 20 urinary tract infections, two soft tissue infections and one sepsis. In 14 of 16 patients with nosocomial pneumonia but in only one of nine patients with community-acquired pneumonia did we find coexisting opportunistic lung diseases. The following micro-organisms were isolated: P. aeruginosa in 41 cases, P. fluorescens in three cases, Xanthomonas maltophilia (P. maltophilia) in two cases, P. putida in one case. Comamonas testosteronis (P. testosteronis) and Comamonas acidovorans (P. acidovorans) in one case. Amikacin and ceftazidime, alone or in combination, appear to be the optimal choice of therapy for severe Pseudomonas infections in HIV-infected patients, although in our study six of 47 isolates were resistant in vitro to amikacin, and nine of 31 isolates were resistant to ceftazidime."

TITLE:Isolation of Legionella maceachernii from an immunocompromised patient with severe underlying lung disease.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To present the first case in Australia in which Legionella maceachernii has been documented as a cause of infection. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 71-year-old retired carpenter with underlying autoimmune disease and pulmonary fibrosis was admitted to hospital with increasing shortness of breath and fever, and pneumonia was diagnosed. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: He was treated with ampicillin then gentamicin and flucloxacillin and later imipenem but his condition deteriorated with progression of the pneumonia and abscess formation and he died 25 days after admission. Subsequently, L. maceachernii was isolated from three sputum samples collected before the patient died. 
CONCLUSION: There is a need for clinical awareness of the value of sputum culture in the diagnosis of infection due to Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila."

ABSTRACT:In the case described, fatal Vibrio vulnificus primary septicemia was complicated by development of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Clinical features of this recently discovered infectious disease are discussed. Various aspects of diagnoses of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with V vulnificus septicemia are also presented. Vibriosis should be suspected in patients with chronic, underlying, predisposing diseases, recent ingestion of raw seafood, and characteristic skin lesions."

ABSTRACT:The route of infection and the course of two typical nosocomial infections are described in two patients infected with a rare gram-negative bacterium. Both patients underwent cardiovascular surgery. They were placed close to each other in the intensive care unit for several days and suffered from pneumonia and from wound infection respectively. In both patients bacterial culture grew Hafnia alvei. Successful antibiotic treatment was achieved with Netilmicin and Imipenem. Urinary tract, respiratory tract and wound infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections according to the literature. Risk factors are duration of stay in the intensive care unit, shock, poor general condition and advanced age."

TITLE:[A case of septicemia due to Capnocytophaga ochracea beginning post radiation therapy for lung cancer].
ABSTRACT:A 46-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on Mar. 16, 1988 with the chief complaint of productive cough. The chest roentgenogram and tomogram showed a tumorous shadow in the right upper lobe, accompanied with stenosis of the trachea and the right main bronchus. Bronchofiberscopic examination confirmed a nodular tumor protruding into the lower part of the trachea from the right lateral wall and nearly complete obstruction of the right main bronchus. Pathological specimen obtained by transbronchial biopsy revealed ""low differentiated adenocarcinoma"". It was highly suspected that the primary lung cancer had directly invaded the trachea and the right main bronchus. His symptoms and roentgenological findings remarkably improved after radiation therapy. He was discharged on May 12. On Sep. 14, he was admitted to our hospital again because of hoarseness, general fatigue and increasing dyspnea. The chest CT demonstrated severe stenosis of the trachea, which was treated with another radiation therapy. Although his symptoms diminished, he had a sudden onset of high fever on Oct. 15. Immediately a blood culture and transtracheal aspiration (TTA) were performed. Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the blood culture four days later. The administration of fosfomycin and tobramycin was started. However he died because of massive hemoptysis on Oct. 23. Several days after the death, an isolated strain was identified as Capnocytophaga ochracea by the biochemical characteristics. Culture of sputum obtained by TTA was negative for Capnocytophaga ochracea. Septicemia due to Capnocytophaga spp. is very rare and only one case (due to Capnocytophaga sputigena) has been reported until now in Japan. Our patient is thought to be the first case of septicemia due to Capnocytophaga ochracea in Japan."

TITLE:Infection caused by Francisella philomiragia (formerly Yersinia philomiragia). A newly recognized human pathogen.
ABSTRACT:We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with Francisella philomiragia (formerly Yersinia philomiragia) isolated from normally sterile sites. Isolates from 14 patients were received by the Centers for Disease Control between 1975 and 1987: 9 were from blood; 2 from lung biopsies; and 1 each from pleural, peritoneal, and cerebrospinal fluid. Underlying problems included chronic granulomatous disease in 5 patients, near-drowning in 5, and a myeloproliferative disease in 2. All 13 patients for whom records were available had a febrile syndrome compatible with bacterial infection. Pneumonia and fever-bacteremia were the commonest clinical syndromes reported. In 7 cases, F. philomiragia was the only sterile-site isolate, and the clinical syndrome did not resolve without appropriate antibiotics. Familiarity with this organism is important because of its ability to cause serious disease in chronic granulomatous disease and near-drowning patients. Further study may yield new insights into pathogenic and host defense mechanisms."

TITLE:Legionella species as hospital-acquired respiratory pathogens.
ABSTRACT:Nosocomial pneumonia caused by legionella is an increasingly recognized entity. Legionella sp responsible for documented nosocomial disease include Legionella pneumophila, Tatlockia micdadei, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffi and Legionella oakridgensis. The clinical presentation is nonspecific although diarrhea occurs frequently. Hyponatremia occurs significantly more frequently in legionnaires' disease than pneumonias caused by other agents. Chest roentgenographic findings are nonspecific, although cavitation can be seen in immunosuppressed patients. Laboratory methods require the use of direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains, culture using selective media, serologic testing, and detection of antigen in urine. The DFA test is not sensitive; however, it does correlate with the severity of disease. Culture from sputa is now feasible. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a promising technique for obtaining specimens. The ideal specimen for culture is that obtained by transtracheal aspiration, which bypasses oropharyngeal contamination. Combination therapy of erythromycin and rifampin is recommended for selected patients. Because the source of the organism is the hospital water distribution system, we recommend routine environmental surveillance, especially in hospitals in which organ transplants are performed. The role of cooling towers as a vector for dissemination of the organism is disputed. Disinfection of the water supply can be accomplished by using heat eradication. Chlorination has generally proven unsatisfactory because of organism persistence as well as corrosive damage to the plumbing system from the chlorine. Both physician awareness and availability of specialized laboratory testing are necessary for the detection of cases."

TITLE:Prevalence of Legionnaires' disease in pneumonia patients admitted to a Danish department of infectious diseases.
ABSTRACT:During a 14-month study period, 92 patients admitted to the University Clinic for Infectious Diseases with pneumonia were investigated to determine the prevalence and severity of Legionnaires' disease (LD). The diagnosis of LD was based on positive serology. Antibodies to 10 different legionella antigens--Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-6, Fluoribacter (Legionella) bozemanae, F. dumoffii, F. gormanii, and Tatlockia (Legionella) micdadei--were measured by the microagglutination (MA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques. LD was diagnosed in 22 patients showing a 4-fold or greater rise of MA titers. 10 patients showed a 4-fold or greater rise of IFA titer, 2 had standing high titer. One patient died. Legionella infection was the second most common cause of pneumonia. However, in half of the cases legionella infection occurred concomitantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, or viral infections. All 22 LD cases were sporadic. LD had been contracted abroad by 6 patients. Two of the legionella pneumonias were hospital-acquired. Half of the LD patients were older than 60 years. The majority of cases occurred during the winter months. Neither clinical chemistry parameters nor clinical features could distinguish LD from other types of pneumonia."

ABSTRACT:Kingella species are rarely reported as a cause of endocarditis. We report two cases of K. denitrificans endocarditis occurring in patients with prosthetic valves. K. denitrificans has not been previously reported to cause prosthetic valve endocarditis. Both patients may have developed bacteremia from altered upper respiratory or oral mucosa with subsequent prosthetic valve infection. Treatment with penicillin G and streptomycin was successful in the first patient, whereas ampicillin alone resulted in clinical cure in the second case. Neither patient required further surgery. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that both organisms were highly sensitive to cefotaxime and ampicillin."

ABSTRACT:Twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. Twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. No bacteria became resistant. Cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). The bacteria responsible for these infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Serratia marcescens (two), Enterobacter gergoviae (three), Enterobacter aerogenes (two), Escherichia coli (one), Citrobacter diversus (one), and Hemophilus influenzae (one). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. Two patients in whom a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. Diarrhea developed in a single patient with Pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. Aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. The only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients."

The Legionella wadsworthii species nova is proposed for this bacterium. The type strain is Wadsworth 81-716A (American Type Culture Collection 33877). The new species differs phenotypically from L. pneumophila in that the predominant cellular fatty acid is methyl-12-methyltetradecanoic acid (a-15:0) rather than methyl-14-methylpentadecanoic acid (i-16:0), and in its failure to react with L. pneumophila antiserum. The clinical illness caused by L. wadsworthii was not apparently different from that seen with other legionella infections, except for prolonged fever and slow resolution of pulmonary infiltrates."

TITLE:Pulmonary infection due to Legionella cincinnatiensis in renal transplant recipients: two cases and implications for laboratory diagnosis.
ABSTRACT:We report two cases of pneumonia caused by Legionella cincinnatiensis, a species previously identified as a pathogen in only one other instance. Both infections occurred in renal transplant recipients who were receiving only moderate doses of immunosuppressive drugs several years after transplantation; both patients had no recent episodes of rejection. Their clinical courses varied from mild symptoms to multisystem organ failure and death. Species identification by direct fluorescent antibody testing was misleading; initial results revealed infection due to Legionella longbeachae for one patient and infection due to Legionella dumoffii for the other patient. Slide agglutination testing eventually identified both isolates as L. cincinnatiensis. Infection with Legionella species, including L. cincinnatiensis, should be considered not only in the first months after transplantation but also later in the posttransplantation period as either a nosocomial or community-acquired infection."

ABSTRACT:In 1987, an outbreak of pneumonia and meningitis caused by an unknown bacterium occurred in a spa therapy centre. Nine isolates of this pathogen constituted a tight DNA hybridization group. rRNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the studied bacteria represented a new branch in superfamily II (= gamma subclass) of the Proteobacteria, close to the genus Oceanospirillum. The new bacterium was highly polymorphic and, in young cultures, had curved Gram-negative cells, motile by polar single flagella. The new bacterium differed from the genus Oceanospirillum by its lacking the NaCl requirement and by reducing nitrate into nitrite, producing indole from tryptophan and producing acid from carbohydrates. The name Balneatrix alpica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for the studied organism. The type strain is strain 4-87 (= CIP 103589)."

ABSTRACT:Hafnia alvei is a gram-negative bacterium that is rarely isolated from human specimens and is rarely considered to be pathogenic. It has been associated with gastroenteritis, meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, nosocomial wound infections, endophthalmitis, and a buttock abscess. We studied 80 H. alvei isolates recovered from 61 patients within a period of 30 months. H. alvei was cultured from sites that included the respiratory tract (n = 38), the gastrointestinal tract (n = 16), and the urogenital tract (n = 12); the organism was found in blood cultures (n = 8), on central venous catheters (n = 3), and on the skin (n = 3). Only 25% of H. alvei isolates were recovered in pure cultures. Fifty-seven (93.4%) of the patients had an underlying illness. H. alvei proved to be the etiologic agent in two episodes of septicemia and in one episode of peritonitis and was probably responsible for septicemia in two other patients and pneumonia in one. All six of these patients recovered after receiving antibiotic treatment and/or standard surgical treatment, when needed. Three of these infections were nosocomial, and three were community acquired. Of the strains of H. alvei tested in our study, 100% were susceptible to netilmicin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem; 92% were susceptible to piperacillin; 90% were susceptible to co-trimoxazole; and 88% were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. In this study, we found H. alvei to be a rare significant etiologic agent of nosocomial and community-acquired infections."

TITLE:Near-drowning-associated Aeromonas pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Aeromonas is increasingly recognized as a human pathogen that causes a variety of different infections. Aeromonas has rarely been reported as a cause of respiratory infection, and it has been described in near-drowning-associated pneumonia. This article reviews a case of Aeromonas sobria pneumonia associated with a near drowning and considers the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 10 previously reported cases. Nearly all of the cases involved young healthy men, a rapid development of pneumonia and sepsis after a brief stable period postimmersion, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography. A very high rate of positive blood cultures and mortality was also noted. The epidemiological and clinical data in this review may be helpful to the clinician caring for near-drowning victims. Although prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for near-drowning victims, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be rapidly instituted with any evidence of infection."

ABSTRACT:Flavimonas oryzihabitans is rarely reported as a pathogen in humans. Twelve cases of F. oryzihabitans bacteremia were diagnosed at National Taiwan University Hospital over a 3-year period. The clinical features of these patients were analyzed, and antimicrobial susceptibilities and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns of the 12 isolates were studied. Among these 12 patients, eight (67%) had underlying neoplastic diseases and all acquired F. oryzihabitans bacteremia while hospitalized. The clinical syndromes included primary bacteremia in 5 patients (42%), biliary tract infection in 3 (25%), and peritonitis, subdural empyema, infusion-related bacteremia, and pneumonia in 1 each. Polymicrobial bacteremia or concomitant fungemia was seen in three patients (25%). All the patients survived after antibiotic treatment. All isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones but resistant to cephalothin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim. Susceptibility to aztreonam was variable (25%). The RAPD patterns differed among the isolates, indicating the epidemiological unrelatedness of these infections. F. oryzihabitans should be included as an etiology of severe nosocomial infection in patients with underlying debilitating diseases."

TITLE:Leclercia adecarboxylata infections: case report and review.
ABSTRACT:Leclercia adecarboxylata has been rarely isolated from environmental and clinical specimens. On review of the world literature, we found two reports of L. adecarboxylata infection: one report described a patient with hepatic cirrhosis, and the other described a child dependent on total parenteral nutrition. L. adecarboxylata was isolated from five infected patients who were evaluated at our institution. Three patients had lower-extremity wound infections in which L. adecarboxylata was part of a mixed microbial growth. One patient had pneumonia due to multiple bacteria, including L. adecarboxylata, which were isolated from sputum. L. adecarboxylata was isolated from the blood of one patient with neutropenia and from the blood of the two patients reported in the literature. All patients except one had fever and leukocytosis. L. adecarboxylata isolates were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested. L. adecarboxylata is most frequently isolated as part of a mixed microbial growth. Its role in these infections is not clear. However, the organism caused bacteremia in three patients."

TITLE:Two nursing home outbreaks of respiratory infection with Legionella sainthelensi.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe outbreaks of infection caused by Legionella sainthelensi occurring in older residents of two nursing homes and to determine risk factors for the development of infection. DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology and a case-control study. SETTING: Two nursing homes (140 beds and 254 beds in nursing homes A and B, respectively) located in southern Ontario, Canada, experiencing outbreaks of respiratory tract infection in July and August 1994. SUBJECTS: Case-residents of the two nursing homes who met clinical and laboratory criteria for Legionella infection. Control-residents were defined as those who were in the homes during the outbreaks and were asymptomatic. MEASUREMENTS: Active surveillance was conducted in both nursing homes to identify symptomatic residents. Residents with fever or respiratory tract symptoms had nasopharyngeal swabs taken for viral antigen detection and culture, urine for Legionella antigen detection, and acute and convalescent serology for viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella. Chest X-rays were performed, and an attempt was made to obtain blood and sputum cultures. Water samples from shower heads, faucets, and air conditioning units were collected for Legionella culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A case-control study was done to assess possible risk factors for legionellosis. 
RESULTS: Twenty-nine cases -- 17 in nursing home A; 12 in nursing home B - were identified. Four (14%) case-residents had documented pneumonia and four case-residents died. Univariate analysis revealed that a history of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0-5.3)), eating pureed food (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6-12.7)), and having fluids administered with medication (OR 2.5 (95% CI, 1.0-5.9)) were significant risk factors. Cases were less likely to wear dentures (OR .4 (95% CI, .2-.9)) or to eat solid food (OR .3, (95% CI, .1-.6)). Only eating pureed food remained significant in a multivariable analysis (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6-13.0, P = .01)). 
CONCLUSION: This report describes outbreaks of legionellosis in two nursing homes, representing the first reported outbreaks of infection caused by Legionella sainthelensi. The association with illness of dietary characteristics indicative of swallowing disorders suggests that aspiration was the most likely mode of infection. The diagnosis of legionellosis should be considered during outbreaks of respiratory infection in nursing homes."

TITLE:Second-trimester abortion caused by Capnocytophaga sputigena: case report.
ABSTRACT:Intra-amniotic infection is often the cause of a second-trimester abortion. The bacterial species involved include bacteria with low pathogenicity like Ureaplasma urealyticum and various Mycoplasma species. In this case we describe an intra-amniotic infection caused by Capnocytophaga sputigena, often found in the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity, but not in the vagina. Oral sex during pregnancy was the most probable source of the infection. The aborted fetus showed signs of pneumonia upon histologic examination. The bacterial species was identified using broad-spectrum 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly from the amniotic fluid and after bacterial culture. Amniotic fluid glucose was below detection level, confirming the presence of an intra-amniotic infection."

TITLE:Relapsing life threatening community acquired pneumonia due to rare Legionella species responsive to ceftriaxone and aztreonam.
ABSTRACT:A 24 year old Saudi housewife was admitted thrice with life threatening community acquired pneumonia. Even though she responded to an initial cocktail of cefriaxone, erythromcin, rifampicin and flucloxacillin during the second admission, she relapsed within four days of discharge when she was on erythromycin only. During the third admission she was put on ceftriaxone and aztreonam and recovered fully without any relapse. Serology results received later showed Legionella IgM titres of more than 1:256 for Legionella micdadei and Legionella bozemanii, and IgG titres of Legionella hackeliae. This case demonstrates relapsing pneumonia due to Legionella micdadei and bozemanii infection, and previous exposure to Legionella hackeliae. Both species, that is, Legionella micdadei and bozemanii, are resistant to erythromycin, but responded very well to a combination of ceftriaxone and aztreonam have not been used previously for the treatment of Legionnaires diseases."

TITLE:Flavobacterium spp. organisms as opportunistic bacterial pathogens during advanced HIV disease.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of Flavobacterium spp. infection in patients with HIV disease. 
METHODS: Clinical charts of 2412 consecutive HIV-infected patients hospitalized in a 8-year period were retrospectively reviewed, to identify all cases of Flavobacterium spp. infections, and to evaluate their occurrence and outcome according to several epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters. 
RESULTS: Six patients out of 2412 (0.25%), developed Flavobacterium spp. complications: septicaemia in five cases, and pneumonia in the remaining patient, with F. meningosepticum and F. odoratum isolated in two cases and one case, respectively, and unnamed Flavobacterium spp. organisms in the remaining three cases. Flavobacterium spp. organisms were responsible for six out of 1939 overall episodes of non-mycobacterial bacterial diseases observed in our patient group (0.31%). All patients were severely immunocompromised, showing a prior diagnosis of AIDS, a mean CD4+ lymphocyte count of 64.2 (range 12-187) cells/microl, and a mean neutrophil count of 1.143 (range 700-1600) cells (range 700-1600) cells/microl. Antibiotic, corticosteriod, or cotrimoxazole treatment was carried out during the month preceding disease onset by three, two and five patients, respectively. Community-acquired and nosocomial Flavobacterium spp. disease were equally frequent, but the latter occurred with a significantly lower mean neutrophil and CD4+ cell count. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays showed complete sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, and variable resistance to ureidopenicillins, ceftazidime, imipenem, aztreonam, and aminoglycosides. An appropriate antimicrobial regimen obtained clinical and microbiological cure in all cases, in absence of related mortality or relapses. 
CONCLUSIONS: Since only one episode of HIV-associated F. (Sphingobacterium) multivorum complication has been described to date, our series represents the largest one dealing with Flavobacterium spp. infection in the setting of HIV disease. Our experience suggests that Flavobacterium spp. organisms may play a pathogenic role in patients with advanced HIV disease, even when some commonly recognized risk factors are lacking (i.e. indwelling catheters, instrumentation, IV drug abuse), while a very low CD4+ lymphocyte count, leukopaenia-neutropaenia, and concurrent AIDS-related infectious complications may act as important predisposing factors. In view of the infrequent occurrence of these infections, early suspicion is essential for both clinicians and microbiologists facing immunocompromised patients at risk for invasive bacterial complications. Flavobacterium spp. organisms should be taken into consideration as nosocomial- or community-acquired opportunistic pathogens, due to their relationship with advanced immunodeficiency and their elevated resistance to many antimicrobial agents commonly used against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens."

ABSTRACT:Recurrent soft tissue abscesses of the jaw, wrist, and arm developed in a 73-year-old housewife with nephrotic syndrome and immunoglobulin A(kappa) gammopathy of unknown etiology. Conventional cultures remained negative, despite visible gram-negative rods on microscopy. Broad-spectrum PCR revealed Legionella cincinnatiensis, which was confirmed by isolation of the organism on special Legionella medium. Infections due to Legionella species outside the lungs are rare. L. cincinnatiensis has been implicated in only four cases of clinical infection; these involved the lungs in three patients and the central nervous system in one patient. We conclude that broad-spectrum PCR can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of culture-negative infections with a high probability of bacterial origin and that Legionella might be an underdiagnosed cause of pyogenic soft tissue infection."

ABSTRACT:Human oral Capnocytophaga species have been only rarely described as a cause of sepsis in patients following stem cell or marrow transplantation, and pneumonia has not been reported in this setting. In addition, fluoroquinolone resistance is rarely seen in these species, and has never been reported in C. gingivalis. We report a case of pneumonia (confirmed by culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and sepsis due to fluoroquinolone- resistant Capnocytophaga gingivalis in a patient following autologous stem cell transplantation, who responded to treatment with linezolid and metronidazole. Capnocytophaga infections should be considered in patients with fever following stem cell or marrow transplantation, especially those with neutropenia and mucositis. Susceptibility testing is needed given the existence of multidrug-resistant isolates."

ABSTRACT:Neisseria weaveri (formerly CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] group M-5 is part of the normal canine oral flora. Infections in humans are usually associated with dog bite wounds. Very rarely the organism has been isolated from sites other than wounds, or from deep seated infections. A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of an acute exacerbation of his bronchiectasis. Gram stain of bronchial washings and expectorated sputum showed numerous polymorphs and Gram-negative bacilli. Routine bacterial culture yielded a heavy pure growth of a Gram-negative rod-shaped organism that was strongly oxidase and catalase positive, indole negative, non-motile and did not ferment carbohydrates. The organism was identified as N. weaveri by using 16S rRNA sequencing. The patient was treated with a 3 weeks course of ofloxacin and had a good response. Sputum culture after treatment yielded normal respiratory flora only. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of lower respiratory tract infection caused by N. weaveri."

TITLE:Moraxella osloensis blood and catheter infections during anticancer chemotherapy: clinical and microbiologic studies of 10 cases.
ABSTRACT:Moraxella osloensis, a gram-negative bacterium that is saprophytic on skin and mucosa, rarely causes infections. Moreover, infections in patients with cancer have not been reported. We describe 10 cases of M. osloensis blood or catheter infections that occurred during anticancer chemotherapy with or without preexisting neutropenia. The organism was identified definitively by sequencing analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Fever (up to 39.7 degrees C) with substantial neutrophilia characterized these infections. The infections were monomicrobic for 3 patients and polymicrobic for 7 patients. Nine patients acquired the infection through central venous catheter colonization. The likely sources of the organism were sinusitis (3 cases), bronchitis (1 case), presumed subclinical mucositis from anticancer therapy (4 cases), and cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (2 cases). The infections resolved, without catheter removal, after antibiotic therapy with cell wall-active agents, to which all strains were shown to be susceptible. The M. osloensis strains exhibited significant morphologic variations on gram stain, and sheep blood agar was the preferred culture medium for 9 strains."

TITLE:Legionella in two splenectomized patients. Coincidence or causal relationship?
ABSTRACT:We describe two splenectomized patients admitted with pneumonia. The course in one was complicated by overwhelming multiorgan failure when the only indicative laboratory result was seropositivity for Legionella hackeliae and Legionella longbeachae. He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and roxithromycin, followed by levofloxacin as well as intensive supportive treatment, and survived. The second patient was seroreactive for Legionella micdadei. In some cases of pneumonia in splenectomized patients tentatively considered to be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the causative agent might have, in fact, been Legionella. We suggest that splenectomy be considered a possible predisposing factor for Legionella pneumonia. Since prompt diagnosis of Legionella infection, especially the non- pneumophila species, is extremely difficult, alertness to this diagnostic option and early empirical initiation of appropriate aggressive antibiotic treatment may be of critical importance."

TITLE:Microbiological investigations on a nosocomial case of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia associated with water birth and review of neonatal cases.
ABSTRACT:A case of Legionella pneumophila 1 pneumonia, confirmed by positive serology and urinary antigen, occurred in a 7-day old neonate after water birth in hospital. As respiratory samples were not available for culture, further microbiological investigations were performed in neonate and environment, in order to recognize the source of infection. The hospital water supply was contaminated by L. pneumophila 1 strains (300-2000 cfu/L) of two monoclonal subtypes of Pontiac subgroup. L. spiritensis (10-225 cfu/L) was isolated from cold tap water of the patient's home. PCR from tap and humidifiers water of the patient's home was positive for Legionella spp, but not for L. pneumophila. Because L. pneumophila 1, responsible of child infection, was only isolated from the hospital pool water for waterbirthing, we conclude that the infant acquired the nosocomial legionellosis by prolonged delivery in contaminated water, perhaps by aspiration. Infection control measures for waterbirthing are highly recommended. A review of neonatal case of legionellosis is also presented. As this rare infection may have a high fatality rate if unrecognized, pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of the legionellosis in newborns."

We report a pneumonia in a patient with chronic renal failure, who had chronic rejection of transplanted kidney. E. americana was identified to be the pathogen of pneumonia with clinical symptoms and signs and radiological examination. As soon as he was treated with ceftriaxone and isepamicin, clinical improvement was followed with no further growth of E. americana or other pathogenic isolates from sputum culture. This suggests to be the case of pneumonia caused by E. americana for the first time in the Korean literature."

ABSTRACT:In July 2002, a large outbreak of legionellosis occurred in a bathhouse with spa facilities in Miyazaki Prefecture. Two hundred-ninety-five patients (including suspected cases) that had pneumonia and/or symptoms of fever, cough and so forth were reported; 37% of them were hospitalized and seven people died. In environmental investigations, Legionella pneumophila serogroups (SGs) land 8, L. dumoffii, L. londiniensis, some other Legionella species and many kinds of amoeba were isolated from 55 samples of bathtub water, tank water, filters and so forth in the spa facilities. The dominant isolates from the bathtab waters belonged to L. londiniensis, L. dumoffii and L. pneumophila SG1, and their maximum concentrations were 1.5 x 10(6), 5.2 x 10(5) and 1.6 x 10(5) cfu/100 mL, respectively. L. pneumophila SG1 strains isolated from bathtub water, tank water, filters and sputa of patients showed a indistinguishable DNA fingerprint pattern by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), confirming that the source of infection was the spa water. Our study indicate that spas may be a significant health hazard if hygienic management fails."

On the third day after surgery the patient developed radiographic signs consistent with pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Two blood cultures and a respiratory secretion sample grew a microorganism identified as Hafnia alvei. H. alvei is a gram-negative bacillus that colonizes the digestive tract of humans and animals and in immunodepressed patients it can colonize the mouth and pharynx. Isolation of H. alvei is described in the literature on pediatric patients and those with a history of immune deficiency or chronic disease. Infection has a severe impact on general health. We report a rare and interesting case of pneumonia and bacteremia from H. alvei infection acquired by an immunocompetent patient soon after arrival in the postoperative recovery unit.

TITLE:Legionella waltersii--a novel cause of pneumonia?
ABSTRACT:UNLABELLED: A 5-y-old girl was admitted to our hospital with fever, cough, respiratory distress and rapidly increasing oxygen requirements. A chest radiograph showed bilateral central infiltrates. PCR was performed with pharyngeal washings and revealed Legionella DNA, while no genetic materials of other pathogens such as respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia were detected. The clinical condition improved gradually after administration of steroids and therapy with clarithromycin. Further sequencing of Legionella DNA led to the identification of Legionella waltersii. This Legionella species has never been described as a human pathogen before. 
CONCLUSION: For the first time, L. waltersii was identified as a cause of severe pneumonia. Since L. waltersii is not detected by routine laboratory tests, it may be speculated that these bacteria, like other Legionella species, are underestimated as a probable cause of community-acquired pneumonia."

ABSTRACT:To elucidate the role of ameba-associated microorganisms (AAMs) as etiologic agents of pneumonia, we screened for Legionella spp., Parachlamydia acanthamoeba, Afipia sp., Bosea spp., Bradyrhizobium spp., Mesorhizobium amorphae, Rasbo bacterium, Azorhizobium caulinodans, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, and conventional microorganisms in 210 pneumonia patients in intensive-care units by using culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serologic testing. These resulted in 59 diagnoses in 40 patients. AAMs and non-AAMs were implicated in 10.5% of the patients. The infectious agents were identified in 15 patients: Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, 8; Legionella pneumophila, 3; L. anisa, 1; Parachlamydia sp., 1; Bosea massiliensis, L. worsleiensis, L. quinlivanii, and L. rubrilucens, 1; and M. amorphae and R. bacterium, 1. A. polyphaga mimivirus was the fourth most common etiologic agent, with a higher seroprevalence than noted in healthy controls. This finding suggested its clinical relevance. Therefore, AAM might cause nosocomial pneumonia and should be suspected when conventional microbiologic results are negative."

TITLE:Multidrug-resistant Ewingella americana: a case report and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe and report a case of multidrug-resistant Ewingella americana associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old female presented to her physician with shortness of breath and an initial assessment of pneumonia. Her past medical history included COPD, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, recent Mycobacterium avium infection, and Crohn's disease. Blood and urine cultures revealed no growth; however, a sputum culture later revealed multidrug-resistant E. americana. The patient was ultimately treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), with complete resolution of symptoms following a 10 day course. DISCUSSION: E. americana is a rare gram-negative bacillus that has infrequently been reported to cause infection. This organism has been reported in humans in the blood, sputum, conjunctiva, wounds, and peritoneal fluid. In several of these cases, as well as in our case, this organism appeared to occur more frequently in immunocompromised patients. Although generally susceptible to most antibiotics, our patient's organism was resistant to all antibiotics tested, with the exception of TMP/SMX, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and cefotetan. 
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is only the second case of an E. americana respiratory infection, and the only one in which multidrug resistance has been reported."

ABSTRACT:Bordetella spp. are not normally included when considering the opportunistic bacterial species that are typically involved in respiratory tract infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). By using a combination of bacterial genotyping and 16S rDNA sequencing, Bordetella spp. were identified in cultures obtained from 43 individuals with CF. Most (n = 23) patients were infected with Bordetella bronchiseptica/parapertussis; five were infected with Bordetella hinzii, four with Bordetella petrii, three with Bordetella avium, and eight with unidentified Bordetella spp. Consideration should be given to the presence of these organisms in the evaluation of CF sputum cultures."

ABSTRACT:We describe in this article a case of septicaemia with Capnocytophaga suptigena in a premature newborn child. The newborn child exhibited fever at birth, a light inflammatory syndrome and a respiratory failure. The germ was initially identified in the blood-culture of the newborn child by conventional techniques, and then confirmed by sequencing of the ARN 16S. After investigation, it was also found in the mother's vaginal sample. Capnocytophaga sputigena carried by the mother is certainly responsible for infection of the newborn child by ascending way. After antibiotherapy, both mother and child did not present aftereffects. This is the 16th case described in the literature; Capnocytophaga sputigena carried in vaginal area is responsible for preterm labor and for septicaemia associated to respiratory failure of the newborn child. It is thus important not to neglect this germ and to estimate its sensibility to antibiotics."

ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia is complicated by purulent pleural effusion in approximately 28% of affected children. Its incidence has increased over the last decade. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent causal microorganism, encountered in roughly 80% of cases. We report the case of an immunocompetent 13-year-old teenager wearing orthodontic braces who suffered from pleuropneumonia due to Capnocytophaga sputigena. To date, this Gram-negative bacillus, a commensal of the buccal cavity, had never been reported to be responsible for pleural or lung infection. The clinical presentation is similar to that observed with usual bacteria, while bacterial sensitivity to betalactam antibiotics is excellent."

ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of severe pneumonitis with Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria. 
METHOD: Case report and review of the related literatures. The clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, radiographic patterns, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of a case of severe pneumonia caused by A. veronii biovar sobria were described. 
RESULTS: The clinical symptoms of this patient included cough and sputum production with high fever, followed by acute respiratory distress symptom associated with septic shock. Progressive infiltration of lungs was evident in chest radiography, changes suggestive of interstitial pneumonia. Oxygenation was improved by mechanical ventilation and anti-shock therapy was administered. A. veronii biovar sobria was grown in three consecutive cultures of airway secretions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Mild interstitial inflammation was revealed by pathology of transbronchial lung biopsy specimens. The clinical symptoms and the chest infiltrates improved significantly after therapy with antibiotics and glucocorticoids. 
CONCLUSIONS: A. veronii biovar sobria, an intestinal bacterial pathogen, can cause severe pneumonia, which is often underestimated and inadequately understood. Appropriate antibiotics, glucocorticoids and nutritional support are effective treatments."

TITLE:[A pneumonia case caused by Cedecea lapagei].
ABSTRACT:Cedecea spp. which are the members of Enterobacteriaceae family, are mostly isolated from sputum and their clinical importance is not yet demonstrated. This report presents a pneumonia case caused by Cedecea lapagei. A 38-years-old male patient admitted to Inonu University Faculty of Medicine Emergency department with prediagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage was operated and transferred to Intensive Care Unit of Reanimation where he underwent artificial ventilation. On the third day of hospitalization his temperature was 39 degrees C, white blood cell count was 27.000/ml and he was still unconscious. He had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chest X-ray revealed opacities in the right lower lobe and mucoid tracheal secretion ensued following tracheal entubation performed after operation. Direct microscopic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid yielded abundant number of leukocytes and gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria isolated from BAL specimen were identified as C. lapagei by Phoenix 100 (Becton Dickinson, USA) automated system and also by API 20E kit (Biomerieux, France). Upon the initiation of intravenous amikacin (1 x 1 g) and meropenem (3 x 1 g), the signs of infection decreased in intensity, however, the patient was lost due to subarachnoid hemorrhage on the 12th day of hospitalization. In this case it was estimated that C. lapagei pneumonia originated from the aspiration of upper airway secretion owing to unconsciousness of the patient. Although there were reports of Cedecea infections in the literature, this was the first documented case of C. lapagei pneumonia when the accessible related literature was concerned."

TITLE:[A community acquired pneumonia case caused by Ralstonia pickettii].
ABSTRACT:Ralstonia pickettii, formerly known as Burkholderia pickettii, is a non-fermentative gram-negative bacillus. It is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen both in the hospital setting and in the environment, leading to outbreaks especially in the intensive care units. The available literature revealed two case reports of pneumonia associated with R. pickettii in adults. In this report, a case of pneumoniae due to R. pickettii, in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was presented. Fifty-six years old male patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of shortness of breath, cough, purulent sputum, weakness, fatigue and green colorred diarrhea lacking blood. Lung auscultation revealed decreased respiratory sounds in the right lower lobe. Laboratory findings yielded decreased arterial pH and paO2 and increased pCO2 values, while hemoglobin, hematocrite, blood urea and creatinine levels were increased. Chest X-ray showed an infiltration on right lower zone. The patient was intubated and imipenem 1 x 500 mg/day and netilmicin 1 x 80 mg/day were initiated. Deep tracheal aspirate specimen revealed gram-negative rods and leukocytes, and cultures yielded growth of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli on blood agar and EMB agar. These bacilli were identified as R. pickettii by using VITEK 2 system (bi-oMerieux Inc, Mercy L'etoil, France). Antibiotic sensitivity test performed by VITEK 2 GP system (bioMerieux Inc, Mercy L'etoil, France) revealed sensitivity to ceftriaxone, imipenem/cilastatin, piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, cefoperazone-sulbactam and ciprofloxacin. Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was continued for 14 days and the patient was completely recovered. This case was presented in order to call attention to R. pickettii as a pathogen that may cause community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection."

TITLE:Lung abscess caused by Legionella species: implication of the immune status of hosts.
ABSTRACT:Legionella pneumonia typically presents as lobar pneumonia with multiple-lobe involvement, but Legionella lung abscess is rare. To identify the predisposing factors for Legionella abscess, we analyzed 62 of the 79 case reports on Legionella abscess found in literature; 28 (45.2%) were of hospital-acquired infection and 28 (45.2%), community-acquired infection. Seventeen patients (27.4%) died. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the most common, but other serogroups of L. pneumophila, L. micdadei, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, and L. maceachernii were also isolated from the abscess. Corticosteroids were administered for underlying diseases to 43 (69.4%) patients. Peripheral neutrophil counts were higher in patients with abscess than in those with only pulmonary infiltration. In certain cases, Legionella abscess developed during neutropenia recovery. However, lymphocyte counts were low in most cases. Clinical factors like corticosteroid treatment, which causes impaired cellular immunity and subsequent neutrophil accumulation in the lesion, might function as predisposing factors for Legionella abscess."

TITLE:[A case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Cupriavidus pauculus].
ABSTRACT:Cupriavidus pauculus (formerly CDC Group IVc-2) is a non-fermentative, motile, gram-negative bacillus, rarely associated with human infections. It has been isolated from water, water from ultrafiltration systems and bottled mineral water. To date, 19 cases of bacteremia, two cases of peritonitis and one case of tenosynovitis associated with C. pauculus have been reported in English literature. In this paper, we report the first case of C. pauculus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in Turkey. A 47 years-old female with breast cancer was performed total mastectomy six years ago and received six cures of chemotherapy after surgery. The patient was hospitalized in medical oncology clinic with complaints of weight loss, nausea and vomiting for one year. Since she had problems of consiousness, dysphagia and pitosis, lumbar puncture was performed to rule out central nervous system infection or metastasis. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed upon the examination of Indian-ink stained smear of cerebrospinal fluid and amphotericin B was initiated. On the 11th day of her follow up, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred to pulmonary intensive care and underwent invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) therapy. On the 4th day of IMV; a new infiltration was detected on the upper zone of chest X-ray in addition to fever (38.3 degrees C) and intense endotracheal secretion. Therefore, bronchoscopic examination was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscope aspiration materials were obtained and cultivated. Bacteria grown at blood agar and EMB agar after 48 hours of incubation were stained as gram-negative bacilli and identified as C. pauculus by VITEK 2 compact system (bioMerieux Inc, USA). The strain was susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacilin/tazobactam and resistant to amikacin. The case was considered as C. pauculus VAP and imipenem (500 mg, 4 x 1) for 14 days was initiated. Clinical and microbiological resolution was achieved by imipenem therapy. In conclusion, rare pathogens like C. pauculus should be considered among the possible causative agents in infections that develop in immunocompromised host."

ABSTRACT:A 28-year-old Cambodian man with a history of congenital heart disease presented with a 6-month history of increasing fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss. His surgical history included two Blalock-Taussig shunts, ventricular septal defect closure, and placement of a pulmonary valve conduit via a Rastelli procedure. Echocardiographic and cardiac computed tomographic studies revealed a vegetation in the pulmonary homograft. Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods that were eventually identified as Suttonella indologenes. The patient underwent a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, which was complicated by septic pulmonary embolism that clinically resolved. Bacterial endocarditis caused by aerobic gram-negative organisms is uncommon. The authors report the first case of S. indologenes endocarditis in a patient with complex congenital heart disease."

TITLE:Two Legionnaires' disease cases associated with industrial waste water treatment plants: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Finnish and Swedish waste water systems used by the forest industry were found to be exceptionally heavily contaminated with legionellae in 2005. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of severe pneumonia in employees working at two separate mills in Finland in 2006. Legionella serological and urinary antigen tests were used to diagnose Legionnaires' disease in the symptomatic employees, who had worked at, or close to, waste water treatment plants. Since the findings indicated a Legionella infection, the waste water and home water systems were studied in more detail. The antibody response and Legionella urinary antigen finding of Case A indicated that the infection had been caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Case A had been exposed to legionellae while installing a pump into a post-clarification basin at the waste water treatment plant of mill A. Both the water and sludge in the basin contained high concentrations of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, in addition to serogroups 3 and 13. Case B was working 200 meters downwind from a waste water treatment plant, which had an active sludge basin and cooling towers. The antibody response indicated that his disease was due to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2. The cooling tower was the only site at the waste water treatment plant yielding that serogroup, though water in the active sludge basin yielded abundant growth of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 5 and Legionella rubrilucens. Both workers recovered from the disease. 
CONCLUSION: These are the first reported cases of Legionnaires' disease in Finland associated with industrial waste water systems."

TITLE:Virulence of an emerging respiratory pathogen, genus Pandoraea, in vivo and its interactions with lung epithelial cells.
ABSTRACT:Pandoraea species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens among cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF patients. Pandoraea pulmonicola is the predominant Pandoraea species among Irish CF patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the pathogenicity and potential mechanisms of virulence of Irish P. pulmonicola isolates and strains from other Pandoraea species. Three patients from whom the P. pulmonicola isolates were isolated have since died. The in vivo virulence of these and other Pandoraea strains was examined by determining the ability to kill Galleria mellonella larvae. The P. pulmonicola strains generally were the most virulent of the species tested, with three showing a comparable or greater level of virulence in vivo relative to another CF pathogen, Burkholderia cenocepacia, whilst strains from two other species, Pandoraea apista and Pandoraea pnomenusa, were considerably less virulent. For all Pandoraea species, whole cells were required for larval killing, as cell-free supernatants had little effect on larval survival. Overall, invasive Pandoraea strains showed comparable invasion of two independent lung epithelial cell lines, irrespective of whether they had a CF phenotype. Pandoraea strains were also capable of translocation across polarized lung epithelial cell monolayers. Although protease secretion was a common characteristic across the genus, it is unlikely to be involved in pathogenesis. In conclusion, whilst multiple mechanisms of pathogenicity may exist across the genus Pandoraea, it appears that lung cell invasion and translocation contribute to the virulence of P. pulmonicola strains."

ABSTRACT:The genus Myroides comprises aerobic, yellow-pigmented, non-motile, non-fermenting gram-negative rods formerly classified as Flavobacterium odoratum. Members of the genus are widely distributed in the environment, especially in water, and usually behave as low-grade opportunistic pathogens, having been found to cause urinary tract infection, endocarditis, ventriculitis, and cutaneous infections in severely immunocompromised patients. We report a case of soft tissue infection, septic shock, and pneumonia due to M. odoratimimus in an immunocompetent male. To our knowledge, this is the first description of life-threatening infection caused by this organism in an immunocompetent host. We have also reviewed the medical literature on the genus Myroides."

ABSTRACT:We report the repeated isolation of Bordetella petrii in the sputum of a 79-year-old female patient with diffuse bronchiectasis and persistence of the bacterium for &gt;1 year. The patient was first hospitalized due to dyspnea, which developed into severe cough with purulent sputum that yielded B. petrii on culture. After this first episode, the patient was hospitalized an additional 4 times with bronchorrhea symptoms. The isolates collected were analyzed by using biochemical, genotypic, and proteomic tools. Expression of specific proteins was analyzed by using serum samples from the patient. The B. petrii isolates were compared with other B. petrii isolates collected from humans or the environment and with isolates of B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii, obtained from human respiratory tract infections. Our observations indicate that B. petrii can persist in persons with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease as has been previously demonstrated for B. bronchiseptica."

ABSTRACT:Pantoea agglomerans is a gram-negative rod that is frequently found on the exterior of many plants, fruits, vegetables, and in soil, and it is used as a biopesticide in the agriculture industry. Recent reports have implicated P. agglomerans in systemic infections of immunocompromised hosts and neonates, as well as more localized infections in healthy hosts. P. agglomerans as a cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia has not been well characterized. We report a case of P. agglomerans pneumonia in a heart-lung transplant recipient following transplantation. The organism was susceptible to multiple antimicrobial agents and treated successfully with ertapenem. We review the patient's course and the relevant literature, and discuss implications for the future."

The cases reported in the literature mostly are nosocomial infections due to contaminated blood products, sterile water, saline, treatment fluids and venous catheters. Human infection unrelated to contaminated solutions is rare. We report a case of lobar pneumonia and pulmonary abscess caused by Ralstonia pickettii in an older patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A sixty-five-year old Han Chinese man presented having had cough, expectoration, chest pain and fever lasting for twenty days. His medical history was notable for hypertension over the previous ten years, and the habit of smoking for forty years. A thoracic computed tomography scan supported the diagnosis of right-sided lobar pneumonia. A lung biopsy was done and pathological analysis confirmed lobar pneumonia. Two lung biopsy specimens from separate sites grew Ralstonia pickettii. After six days, a repeat thoracic scan revealed a right-sided abscess. A thoracentesis was performed and the purulent fluid grew Ralstonia pickettii. The chest tube remained inserted to rinse the cavity with sterile sodium chloride. He received an antibiotic course of intravenous cefoperazone sodium-sulbactam sodium for eighteen days and imipenem-cilastatin for twelve days. A repeat chest X-ray revealed resolution of the pulmonary abscess and improvement of pneumonia. He remained afebrile and free of respiratory symptoms after treatments. 
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates a Ralstonia pickettii infection in the absence of an obvious nosocomial source. It is possible that such cases will become common in the future. Therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate its sensitivity to common antibiotics."

TITLE:[Pandoraea sputorum colonization in a patient with cystic fibrosis].
ABSTRACT:Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease produced by a defect in the transmembrane conductance regulator protein, CFTR. Currently, the morbidity and mortality associated with CF are fundamentally related with the lung affectation that is a consequence of this defect. With the progression of the disease, there is an increase in the isolation of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli colonizing these patients. The genus Pandoraea arises from a reclassification of species included within the ""Burkholderia cepacia complex"". It is made up of 9 species susceptible only to tetracycline, imipenem and cotrimoxazole. We report the first clinical case in Spain of colonization by Pandoraea sputorum in a patient diagnosed with CF at the age of eleven. After several previous colonizations by different Pseudomonas species in September 2005, a gram-negative bacillus was isolated in sputum, which was identified by sequencing and mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) as P. sputorum, only sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam, cotrimoxazole and imipenem. From 2005 to 2008, chronic colonization by this microorganism was associated with deterioration in lung function that was recuperated after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. In 2010, this microorganism was once again isolated and treated with imipenem, to which the patient responded favorably. Currently, it is not known whether this microorganism is a chronic colonizer, whether it produces a transitory infection or whether it constitutes an important problem in CF patients, but given its special characteristics of sensitivity to anti-microbial drugs, the correct identification of this genus is essential. Mass spectrometry seems to be a valid technique that is faster than sequencing methods for identifying these species."

TITLE:Serratia ficaria isolated from sputum specimen.
ABSTRACT:Serratia ficaria was first described in 1979 as a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod. S. ficaria was found in figs, but also isolated from human specimens in a few cases. We now report an isolate of S. ficaria from sputum specimen.A 46-year-old man was suffering from a chronic renal failure of five years, four months of peritoneal dialysis and one week of fever due to respiratory tract infection, accompanied by cough. Sputum culture yielded a Gram-negative rod. It was identified as S. ficaria and the antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by automated Vitek II (bioMerieux). The tested S. ficaria strain was susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, cefepime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, imipenem, meropenem, tigecycline and ciprofloxacin. This strain was resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitine, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone. The patient was treated successfully (80 mg trimethoprim/400 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily for 7 days)S. ficaria is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for intestinal colonization or serious infections such as septicaemia, gall bladder empyema in immunocompromised patients. The fig tree and fig play an important role in human colonization. It should be remembered that S. ficaria infections may be encountered frequently especially in fig tree culture zones."

ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Haemophilus pittmaniae was described in 2005 as a new species distantly related to Haemophilus parainfluenzae. This member of the human saliva microbiota has also been further isolated from various body fluids without formal description of the patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of H. pittmaniae isolate made from a sputum specimen collected from a 58-year-old Caucasian man with a massive fibrotic form of siderosis who was awaiting lung transplantation. Identification of the isolate was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. H. pittmaniae was considered to be responsible for the worsening of the patient's chronic respiratory failure and was successfully treated with oral amoxicillin. 
CONCLUSION: H. pittmaniae should be regarded as a new pathogen responsible for respiratory tract infection in patients with chronic lung diseases."

TITLE:[A case of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Pantoea agglomerans].
ABSTRACT:Pantoea species, which are the members of Enterobacteriaceae family are gram-negative bacilli that are frequently found on many plants and in soil. They may lead to localized infections in healthy subjects and systemic infections in immunosuppressed patients. In this case report a ventilator-associated pneumoniae due to Pantoea agglomerans was presented. A 55 year-old male patient with chronic renal failure was hospitalized in intensive care unit following cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient developed fever (38.8 C), had pulmonary infiltrations in chest X-ray and leucocytosis. Treatment with piperacillintazobactam was initiated upon diagnosis of nosocomial pneumoniae. Bacterial growth from the deep tracheal aspirate of the patient was identified as P.agglomerans by VITEK2 automated system (bioMerieux, France) and the identification was confirmed by conventional microbiological methods. Since the strain was susceptible to the cephoperazon-sulbactam, tobramycin, tetracycline, gentamicin and levofloxacine, the treatment was changed to levofloxacine and cephoperazon-sulbactam and the patient improved. This case was presented to withdraw attention to rare opportunistic pathogens that may lead to nosocomial infections particularly in patients with underlying diseases."

ABSTRACT:Ochrobactrum anthropi, a Gram-negative bacillus, is an unusual human pathogen. It has been implicated primarily in catheter-related bloodstream infections. Sporadic cases of infection at other body sites have been reported. Pneumonia, however, is an exceedingly rare clinical manifestation; only one case has been reported in the medical literature so far. We present another case of lower respiratory tract infection secondary to O. anthropi in a patient who was critically ill, but recovered with a favorable outcome. We have provided an overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of infections due to this rare microorganism."

TITLE:Tension Pneumatocele due to Enterobacter gergoviae Pneumonia: A Case Report.
ABSTRACT:Pneumatocele formation is a known complication of pneumonia. Very rarely, they may increase markedly in size, causing cardiorespiratory compromise. Many organisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease; however, this is the first report of tension pneumatocele resulting from Enterobacter gergoviae pneumonia. We report a case of a 3-month-old Nigerian male child who developed two massive tension pneumatoceles while on treatment for postpneumonic empyema due to Enterobacter gergoviae pneumonia. Tube thoracostomy directed into both pneumatocele resulted in complete resolution and recovery. Enterobacter gergoviae is a relevant human pathogen, capable of causing complicated pneumonia with fatal outcome if not properly managed. In developing countries where state-of the-art radiological facilities and expertise for prompt thoracic intervention are lacking, there is still room for nonoperative management of tension pneumatocele especially in very ill children."

ABSTRACT:AIM: Clinical-microbiological description of the first case in Russia of isolation of S. algae bacteria from clinical material. MATERIALS AND 
METHODS: Patient P., 23 years of age, diagnosis: right-sided distal pneumonia, severe course; parapneumonic empyema of pleura. Bacteria isolation, cultural and biochemical tests differentiating S. algae and Shewanella putrefaciens were performed according to Holt H.M. et al., 2005. Identification of bacteria, tests of sensitivity to antibiotics were carried out by automatic system Vitek 2 (bioMerieux) and additionally by disc-diffusion method. 
RESULTS: S. algae in association with Serratia marcescens were isolated from pleural exudate of the patient with pneumonia. S. algae bacteria had typical taxonomical features and pathogenicity factors (lipase, gelatinase, beta-hemolysin); were resistant to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, cefazolin and sensitive to other beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracycline. 
CONCLUSION: S. algae bacteria isolated from pleural exudate of the patient with pneumonia are etiologically significant in parapneumonic empyema of pleura."

TITLE:Serologic prevalence of amoeba-associated microorganisms in intensive care unit pneumonia patients.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to intensive care units are frequently exposed to pathogenic microorganisms present in their environment. Exposure to these microbes may lead to the development of hospital-acquired infections that complicate the illness and may be fatal. Amoeba-associated microorganisms (AAMs) are frequently isolated from hospital water networks and are reported to be associated to cases of community and hospital-acquired pneumonia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
FINDINGS: We used a multiplexed immunofluorescence assay to test for the presence of antibodies against AAMs in sera of intensive care unit (ICU) pneumonia patients and compared to patients at the admission to the ICU (controls). Our results show that some AAMs may be more frequently detected in patients who had hospital-acquired pneumonia than in controls, whereas other AAMs are ubiquitously detected. However, ICU patients seem to exhibit increasing immune response to AAMs when the ICU stay is prolonged. Moreover, concomitant antibodies responses against seven different microorganisms (5 Rhizobiales, Balneatrix alpica, and Mimivirus) were observed in the serum of patients that had a prolonged ICU stay. 
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our work partially confirms the results of previous studies, which show that ICU patients would be exposed to water amoeba-associated microorganisms, and provides information about the magnitude of AAM infection in ICU patients, especially patients that have a prolonged ICU stay. However, the incidence of this exposure on the development of pneumonia remains to assess."

ABSTRACT:We investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with pneumonia caused by Aeromonas species. Patients with pneumonia caused by Aeromonas species during the period 2004 to 2011 were identified from a computerized database of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 84 patients with pneumonia due to Aeromonas species, possible Aeromonas pneumonia was diagnosed in 58 patients, probable Aeromonas pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 patients, and pneumonia due to Aeromonas was conclusively diagnosed in 8 patients. Most of the cases of Aeromonas pneumonia developed in men and in patients of advanced age. A. hydrophila (n = 50, 59.5 %) was the most common pathogen, followed by A. caviae (n = 24, 28.6 %), A. veronii biovar sobria (n = 7, 8.3 %), and A. veronii biovar veronii (n = 3, 3.6 %). Cancer (n = 37, 44.0 %) was the most common underlying disease, followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 27, 32.1 %). Drowning-associated pneumonia developed in 6 (7.1 %) patients. Of 47 patients who were admitted to the intensive care ward, 42 patients developed acute respiratory failure and 24 of those patients died. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was significantly associated with liver cirrhosis, cancer, initial presentation of shock, and usage of mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, Aeromonas species should be considered as one of the causative pathogens of severe pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised patients, and should be recognized as a cause of drowning-associated pneumonia. Cirrhosis, cancer, and shock as the initial presenting symptom are associated with poor outcome. "

TITLE:Adaptability and persistence of the emerging pathogen Bordetella petrii.
ABSTRACT:The first described, environmentally isolated, Bordetella petrii was shown to undergo massive genomic rearrangements in vitro. More recently, B. petrii was isolated from clinical samples associated with jaw, ear bone, cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary disease. However, the in vivo consequences of B. petrii genome plasticity and its pathogenicity remain obscure. B. petrii was identified from four sequential respiratory samples and a post-mortem spleen sample of a woman presenting with bronchiectasis and cavitary lung disease associated with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Strains were compared genetically, phenotypically and by antibody recognition from the patient and from inoculated mice. The successive B. petrii strains exhibited differences in growth, antibiotic susceptibility and recognition by the patient's antibodies. Antibodies from mice inoculated with these strains recapitulated the specificity and strain dependent response that was seen with the patient's serum. Finally, we characterize one strain that was poorly recognized by the patient's antibodies, due to a defect in the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, and identify a mutation associated with this phenotype. We propose that B. petrii is remarkably adaptable in vivo, providing a possible connection between immune response and bacterial evasion and supporting infection persistence."

TITLE:16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND AND 
OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. 
RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. 
CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD."

ABSTRACT:Infection with Burkholderia species is typically considered a contraindication leading to transplantation in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the risks posed by different Burkholderia species on transplantation outcomes are poorly defined. We present the case of a patient with CF who underwent lung transplantation due to a severe respiratory failure from chronic airways infection with Burkholderia pyrrocinia (B. cepacia genomovar IX) and pan-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent B. pyrrocinia infections, ultimately lea ding to uncontrollable sepsis and death. This is the first case report in CF of Burkholderia pyrrocinia infection and lung transplantation, providing further evidence of the high risk nature of the Burkholderia species."

ABSTRACT:Oligella ureolytica is an emerging bacteria rarely implicated as a human pathogen. It is infrequently recovered from clinical specimens probably because of inadequate processing of non-fermenting oxidase positive Gram negative bacilli. We present here a case of a 30 year old male suffering from right lung adenocarcinoma (moderately differentiated) with multiple abdominal lymph node metastasis with Syringohydromyelia whose blood culture yielded Oligella ureolytica in pure culture. Oligella ureolytica isolation in pure culture and the patient's response to targeted treatment supported that Oligella ureolytica was the true causative agent of the blood stream infection. Early suspicion, diagnosis and treatment with potent antibiotics are needed to prevent further complications resulting from infection with this emerging pathogen. "

The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed there are mass of high density areas around hilus of the left lung, hollow sign with inflammation also appeared. A biopsy specimen was taken from the left principal bronchus by lung puncture biopsy and showed necrosis and inflammation. Microscopic examination of direct smear and culture of sticky pus, much more gram-negative diplococcus was present, pathogen was further identified by Vitek NH card, Vitek MS and confirmed as N. flavescens by 16S rRNA gene sequencing finally. Anti-infection therapy following the antimicrobial susceptibility test results was effectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulmonary infection caused by N. flavescens. "

TITLE:Pneumonia due to Enterobacter cancerogenus infection.
ABSTRACT:Enterobacter cancerogenus (formerly known as CDC Enteric Group 19; synonym with Enterobacter taylorae) has rarely been associated with human infections, and little is known regarding the epidemiology and clinical significance of this organism. We describe a community-acquired pneumonia case in a 44-year-old female due to E. cancerogenus. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of the microorganism was performed by the automatized VITEK 2 Compact system (bioMerieux, France). The clinical case suggests that E. cancerogenus is a potentially pathogenic microorganism in determined circumstances; underlying diseases such as bronchial asthma, empiric antibiotic treatment, wounds, diagnostic, or therapeutic instruments.

TITLE:Antibiotic treatment following a dog bite in an immunocompromized patient in order to prevent Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium found in the saliva of dogs and cats. Clinically significant infections in humans after a bite are often associated with the presence of immune deficiency. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient survival. In addition, patients with immune deficiency are susceptible to serious life-threatening nosocomial infections, which may also influence the prognosis of patients with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation after suffering two small bites from her dog. She had received a splenectomy during childhood. The patient survived after early empiric treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive care, including ventilation support, a high dose of noradrenalin, and continuous venovenous hemodialysis applied prior to the definitive diagnosis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. She improved within 2 weeks but, despite all efforts to prevent nosocomial infection, her hospital course was complicated by Enterococcus species and Candida albicans pleuropneumonia that prolonged her stay in the intensive care unit, and necessitated ventilation support for 2 months. 
CONCLUSION: Severe Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis may be complicated by life-threatening nosocomial infection in immunocompromized patients. The prophylactic application of antibiotics after a dog bite should be considered in high-risk individuals with immune deficiency in order to prevent both Capnocytophyga canimorsus sepsis and serious nosocomial complications."

ABSTRACT:Myroides spp and Chryseobacterium spp are uncommon clinical isolates, though more frequently reported to cause infections than other pigmented non-fermentors. Two cases of Myroides odoratus and Chryseobacterium indologenes infection in a diabetic with pulmonary tuberculosis and a patient with de-compensated alcoholic liver disease, respectively, are reported here. Anti-microbial susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration. The clinical picture, characteristic features of the isolates and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern are discussed briefly. "

TITLE:Aeromonas sobria necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis in an immunocompromised patient: a case report and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria is a rare cause of bacteremia, with several studies indicating that this isolate may be of particular clinical significance since it is enterotoxin producing. A wide spectrum of infections has been associated with Aeromonas species in developing countries that include gastroenteritis, wound infections, septicemia and lung infections. This infection, caused by Aeromonas species, is usually more severe in immunocompromised than immunocompetent individuals. We here describe a case of soft tissue infection and severe sepsis due to Aeromonas sobria in an immunocompromised patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old Caucasian man with a clinical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immune thrombocytopenia, periodically treated with steroids, was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit because of necrotizing fasciitis and multiorgan failure due to Aeromonas sobria, which resulted in his death. The unfortunate coexistence of a Candida albicans infection played a key role in the clinical course. 
CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical therapy are determinants in the treatment of severe septicemia caused by an Aeromonas sobria in an immunocompromised patient."

ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas stutzeri (P. stutzeri) is a Gram-negative, non-fermenting rod. It is a rare pathogen; therefore, its isolation is often associated with colonization or contamination. We herein describe the first reported case of necrotizing pneumonia caused by P. stutzeri in a non-HIV infected patient with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. The isolate was found to be antibiotic resistant, which led to the failure of the initial treatment. This case highlights the unique presentation of necrotizing pneumonia caused by P. stutzeri and the importance of emerging antimicrobial resistance in P. stutzeri. "

ABSTRACT:The use of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) generates rapid microbial identification. We are presenting a case of a 63-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic tracheostomy admitted for hypotension and fevers to illustrate the clinical implication of MALDI-TOF MS on bacterial identification. Kerstersia gyiorum was identified from the bronchoalveolar lavage isolate. Kerstersia gyiorum has been isolated from human sputum samples, and may be a previously unrecognized colonizer of the upper respiratory tract. Thus, patients with long-term tracheotomies or who are chronically aspirating may be at risk of lower respiratory infection with this organism. Increased use of MALDI-TOF MS in the clinical setting may increase reporting of this atypical isolate. "

ABSTRACT:In August 2013, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency was notified of a fatal case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a previously healthy male, aged 10 years, who owned pet rats. Two days before his death, the patient experienced rigors, fevers, vomiting, headaches, and leg pains. His physician noted a fever of 102.6 F (39.2oC), documented a normal examination, diagnosed viral gastroenteritis, and prescribed anti-nausea medication. During the next 24 hours, the patient experienced vomiting and persistent fever. He was confused and weak before collapsing at home. Paramedics reported the patient was unresponsive and had dilated pupils; resuscitation was initiated in the field and was continued for &gt;1 hour after arrival at the emergency department but was unsuccessful. A complete blood count performed during resuscitation revealed anemia (hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL [normal = 13.5-18.0 g/dL], thrombocytopenia (platelets 40,000/microL [normal = 140,000-440,000/microL]), leukocytosis (white blood cells 17,900 cells/microL [normal = 4,000-10,500/microL]) with 16% band neutrophils; the patient also had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. No rash or skin breakdown was noted. Lung, liver, and epiglottis tissue collected postmortem was positive for Streptobacillus moniliformis DNA by polymerase chain reaction. "

TITLE:Microbiological and Clinical Studies of Legionellosis in 33 Patients with Cancer.
ABSTRACT:Legionella, a large group of environmental Gram-negative bacteria, represents an occasional cause of pneumonia. We analyzed the microbiological and clinical features of 33 consecutive cases of Legionella infections that occurred at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, from 2002 to 2014. The Legionella strains were isolated from bronchoscopy specimens (32 strains) and a blood culture (1 strain) and were identified by sequencing analysis of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. The 33 strains involved 12 Legionella species or subspecies: 15 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, 3 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri or L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei, 4 strains of ""L. donaldsonii,"" 3 strains of L. micdadei, and one each of L. bozemanae, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. parisiensis, L. sainthelensi, and Legionella sp. strain D5382. All patients except one asymptomatic carrier showed pneumonia, including one with concurrent bacteremia. Nine patients died, with this infection being the immediate cause of death in six. Twenty-seven patients had underlying hematologic malignancies. Twenty-three patients were leukopenic. Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp. D5382 are likely the first reports of human infection with these organisms. "

ABSTRACT:Kluyvera ascorbata belongs to Enterobacteriaceae family and is a gram negative micro-organism. This bacteria is usually considered a commensal, however it can cause significant infections rarely. This organism is usually resistant to most commonly used antibiotics used as first line in neonatal units. Antimicrobial agents active against Kluyvera strains include third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. We report a case of an extremely low birth weight male infant who presented on day 4 of life with clinical features of sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, shock and pulmonary haemorrhage. Neonatal sepsis was associated with marked elevation of C-reactive protein and a falling platelet count. Infant expired on day 5 of life in spite of aggressive supportive care and treatment with meropenem. with growth of Kluyvera ascorbataon blood culture. "

ABSTRACT:Rahnella aquatilis is an infrequently isolated Gram-negative rod within the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism's natural habitat is water. The organism is rarely isolated from clinical specimens and it seldom causes infection in immunocompetent individuals. Here we present a one-month-old boy who was born prematurely at 27th week of gestation by cesarean section with a birth weight of 730 g. He developed sepsis caused by Rahnella aquatilis during the treatment for ventilator associated pneumonia due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia with ciprofloxacin. He was successfully treated with a combination of amikacin plus meropenem. Although R. aquatilis is one of the saprophyticus organisms, it may cause life-threatening infection in newborn. "

TITLE:Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a high school teacher.
ABSTRACT:Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an inflammatory lung disease mediated by an immunological response to an inhaled antigen. Outbreaks of HP have been reported in industrial settings where manufacturing workers are exposed to water-based metalworking fluids (MWFs). Water-based MWFs promote growth of microorganisms and can be easily aerosolized and are thus potential aetiological agents of HP. We present a case of HP caused by exposure to water-based MWF in a vocational high school teacher. Culture of MWF used at his school grew Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes. This is the first known report of MWF-induced HP outside an industrial setting. The growth of Pseudomonas spp in this case recalls the earliest reports of the microbiology of MWF-induced HP and suggests that routine bacterial culture may be useful in the diagnosis of HP in workplaces without standard cleaning and biocide regulations.

ABSTRACT:Delftia acidovorans is an aerobic, nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus. It is usually a nonpathogenic environmental organism and is rarely clinically significant. Although D acidovorans infection most commonly occurs in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients, there are also several reports documenting the infection in immunocompetent patients. The present article describes a B cell lymphoblastic leukemia patient with D acidovorans pneumonia who was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy. The present report indicates that unusual pathogens may be clinically significant in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. D acidovorans is often resistant to aminoglycosides; therefore, rapid detection of this microorganism is important. "

TITLE:Molecular diagnosis of Legionella infections--Clinical utility of front-line screening as part of a pneumonia diagnostic algorithm.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: Urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the leading rapid diagnostic test for Legionnaires' Disease (LD); however other Legionella species and serogroups can also cause LD. The aim was to determine the utility of front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR in a severe respiratory infection algorithm. 
METHODS: L. pneumophila and Legionella species duplex real-time PCR was carried out on 1944 specimens from hospitalised patients over a 4 year period in Edinburgh, UK. 
RESULTS: L. pneumophila was detected by PCR in 49 (2.7%) specimens from 36 patients. During a LD outbreak, combined L. pneumophila respiratory PCR and urinary antigen testing had optimal sensitivity and specificity (92.6% and 98.3% respectively) for the detection of confirmed cases. Legionella species was detected by PCR in 16 (0.9%) specimens from 10 patients. The 5 confirmed and 1 probable cases of Legionella longbeachae LD were both PCR and antibody positive. 
CONCLUSIONS: Front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR is a valuable addition to urinary antigen testing as part of a well-defined algorithm. Cases of LD due to L. longbeachae might be considered laboratory-confirmed when there is a positive Legionella species PCR result and detection of L. longbeachae specific antibody response."

ABSTRACT:Citrobacter species, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, are environmental organisms commonly found in soil, water, and the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Citrobacter koseri is known to be an uncommon but serious cause of both sporadic and epidemic septicemia and meningitis in neonates and young infants. Most cases reported have occurred in immunocompromised hosts. The infections caused by Citrobacter are difficult to treat with usual broad spectrum antibiotics owing to rapid generation of mutants and have been associated with high death rates in the past. We believe this is the first case described in the literature of a community-acquired pneumonia and empyema caused by Citrobacter koseri in an immunocompetent adult patient. "

TITLE:Epidemic spread of Pandoraea pulmonicola in a cystic fibrosis center.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pandoraea spp. are recently discovered bacteria, mainly recovered from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, but their epidemiology and clinical significance are not well known. We describe an epidemic spread of Pandoraea pulmonicola from 2009 in our CF center, involving 6 out of 243 CF patients. 
METHODS: Bacterial identification used amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The clonal link between strains was assessed with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using XbaI. Clinical data were gathered for all patients. 
RESULTS: The index case was chronically colonized since 2000. The main hypothesis for this bacterial spread was a droplet cross-transmission, due to preventive measures not being strictly followed. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin and colistin. However, there was susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the acquisition of P. pulmonicola resulted in chronic colonization in all patients. Three patients died, and two patients remained clinically stable, whereas one patient had a decline in lung function. 
CONCLUSIONS: This study, which is the first to describe an epidemic spread of P. pulmonicola, notes the potential transmissibility of this bacterial species and the need for infection control measures."

TITLE:Distribution of the species of Achromobacter in a French Cystic Fibrosis Centre and multilocus sequence typing analysis reveal the predominance of A. xylosoxidans and clonal relationships between some clinical and environmental isolates.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Achromobacter spp. are emerging pathogens in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. Recent studies proposed Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme and a species-level identification method by nrdA sequencing for this genus. Epidemiological data are needed to assess the species and/or the sequence types (STs) involved and their potential role in CF patients lung function degradation. The aims of this study were i) to describe the distribution of the different species of Achromobacter in our CF centre ii) to detect potential STs more involved in chronic colonisations iii) to detect a potential local or worldwide predominance of some STs among clinical and environmental isolates. 
METHODS: All the isolates (477) collected in our CF centre from 2007 to 2014 among the 177 patients attending the centre were identified using nrdA sequencing. MLST analysis was performed for 37 clinical and 14 environmental isolates. 
RESULTS: A total of 47 out of 177 patients presented positive culture(s) with Achromobacter spp., representing 12.7% of the patients of the centre each year. Eleven species were detected, A. xylosoxidans being the most prevalent species (27 patients). Only A. xylosoxidans (&gt;80%) and A. insuavis were involved in chronic colonisation (6.7%). MLST analysis revealed a wide diversity among the isolates (36 STs for 51 isolates). Nevertheless, one third of the isolates belonged to STs previously detected in clinical isolates from other countries. 
CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first approach in understanding the global epidemiology of Achromobacter species in CF. These results confirm the high prevalence of the species A. xylosoxidans among CF patients, reveal the worldwide distribution of some STs and point out the potential role of environmental sources of contamination. More studies are needed to search for relationships between species and/or ST and pathogenicity."

TITLE:Emerging role of Raoultella ornithinolytica in human infections: a series of cases and review of the literature.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Raoultella ornithinolytica is known to inhabit aquatic environments. The clinical features and outcomes of human infections caused by R. ornithinolytica have been reported for only a limited number of cases. 
METHODS: A retrospective study of cases of infection caused by R. ornithinolytica managed at four university hospital centres during the period before and after the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed. The aim was to describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. 
RESULTS: Among 187 R. ornithinolytica isolates identified for which clinical information was available, 71 were considered colonizers and 116 were pathogenic. A total of 112 cases of R. ornithinolytica infection were identified. Urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, wound and skin infections, and bacteraemia were observed in 36%, 14%, 13%, and 5% of cases, respectively. Associated infections that have been poorly reported, such as respiratory infections, i.e. pneumonia and pleural effusion, were observed in 24% of cases. Additional diseases reported here for the first time included osteomyelitis, meningitis, cerebral abscess, mediastinitis, pericarditis, conjunctivitis, and otitis. The proportion of R. ornithinolytica isolates resistant to antibiotics was found to be relatively high: 4% of isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone, 6% to quinolones, and 13% to co-trimoxazole. The mortality rate related to infection was 5%. 
CONCLUSIONS: R. ornithinolytica is an underreported, emerging hospital-acquired infection and is particularly associated with invasive procedures. R. ornithinolytica should never be considered simply a saprophytic bacterium that occasionally contaminates bronchial lavage or other deep respiratory samples or surgical sites. Physicians should be aware of the high rates of antimicrobial resistance of R. ornithinolytica isolates so that immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment can be established before accurate microbiological results are obtained."

ABSTRACT:Oligella ureolytica is an emerging bacteria rarely implicated as a human pathogen. It is mostly recovered from urinary and respiratory tract specimens as a commensal organism, but very seldom from bloodstream infections. It is rarely reported in the literature, probably due to misidentification of the organism or uncertainty of its pathogenicity."

TITLE:Fatal transfusion-transmitted infection due to Citrobacter koseri.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI) is still one of the most feared complications of blood transfusion. CASE REPORT: We report a fatal case involving an 8-year-old child with congenital dyskeratosis complicated by severe aplastic anemia who was regularly transfused with platelet (PLT) concentrates for 5 years. The patient received an apheresis PLT concentrate (APC) on Day 0 due to thrombocytopenia complicated by mucocutaneous hemorrhage. Thirty minutes after the start of the transfusion, bradycardia and dyspnea appeared, quickly followed by chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, and hyperthermia. TTBI was suspected and the patient was immediately treated with intravascular antibiotherapy. On Day 3, the patient developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to death on Day 7. Patient blood cultures and APC cultures were both positive for Citrobacter koseri. 
RESULTS: The donor was a 19-year-old woman. She had previously given blood. No infectious symptom was reported during the medical interviews before and after the donation and no postdonation information was received. On the day of the donation (Day -2), her white blood cell count was 5.83 x 109 /L. She came back on Day 8 to undergo additional tests. The cultures from blood, stool, urine, the skin of the inside of the elbow at the point of needle insertion, and ear samples were all negative for C. koseri. However, a nasal sample was positive for C. koseri. 
CONCLUSION: The isolates from the donor's blood cultures, the APC bag, the attached tube, and the donor's nasal sample all gave identical profiles; they were thus identified as the same strain and the TTBI was confirmed."

TITLE:Nosocomial bacteremia due to Kluyvera cryocrescens: Case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:Kluyvera cryocrescens infection has been considered rare; clinical features of K. cryocrescens bacteremia remain unclear because few reports have been published. We report a case of K. cryocrescens bacteremia in an adult male patient and review the literature. Our case was one with nosocomial bacteremia in a patient with interstitial lung disease. The primary infection site was undetermined, although he had an indwelling peripheral intravenous catheter and a urinary catheter. Piperacilin/tazobactam was administered for 2 weeks and the bacteremia resolved. Unfortunately, there was acute exacerbation of the interstitial lung disease, which was fatal. According to our review, including our case, K. cryocrescens bacteremia tends to occur in immunocompromised hosts, and indwelling catheters might be risk factors. Extended spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are generally adequate agents for empiric therapy based on susceptibilities of K. cryocrescens clinical isolates."

TITLE:First report of Wautersiella falsenii genomovar 2 isolated from the respiratory tract of an immunosuppressed man.
ABSTRACT:Wautersiella falsenii is a Gram-negative, non-motile rod, which grows aerobically on common isolation media and is the only acknowledged species among the genus Wautersiella. Two genomovars, namely 1 and 2, phenotypically indistinguishable but genotypically different, are described. To date, few case reports detailing the clinical disease associated with W. falsenii have been reported, all describing localized infection. To our knowledge, this study reports the first isolation of W. falsenii genomovar 2 from a respiratory sample of an immunosuppressed man. Our hypothesis is that the patient was harboring W. falsenii genomovar 2 and both the immunosuppression and the antimicrobial treatments provided a chance for this organism to emerge. The clinical significance of this result is yet to be evaluated. Although infection with W. falsenii remains rare, this bacterium should not be underestimated mainly because of its natural resistance to many available antimicrobials."

TITLE:Pandoraea pnomenusa Isolated from an Australian Patient with Cystic Fibrosis.
ABSTRACT:Pandoraea species are considered as emerging pathogens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The contribution of these organisms to disease progression in CF patients is not fully understood owing in large measure to the scant reports in clinical and research literature describing their colonization of CF patients and their associated virulence determinants. In an effort to increase awareness and evidence for Pandoraea spp. infection in people with CF, and to stimulate research aimed at unraveling the pathogenic properties of Pandoraea, we report a case of a 26-year-old Australian (Tasmanian) man with CF who was chronically infected with Pandoraea pnomenusa for at least one year prior to his death from respiratory failure. In addition, we describe for the first time evidence suggesting that this bacterium is a facultative anaerobe and report on the availability of a whole genome sequence for this organism. To the best of our knowledge, this report represents only the second clinical case study of P. pnomenusa infection in the world, and the first in an Australian CF patient. "

ABSTRACT:Acinetobacter ursingii is an aerobic, gram-negative, opportunistic microorganism which is rarely isolated among Acinetobacter species. We present two immunocompetent infants who developed bacteremia due to A. ursingii. The first patient is a two -month- old boy who had been hospitalized in pediatric surgery unit for suspected tracheo-esophageal fistula because of recurrent aspiration pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. The second patient is a fourteen -month- old boy with prolonged vomiting and diarrhea. A. ursingii was isolated from their blood cultures. They were successfully treated with ampicillin-sulbactam. Although A. ursingii has recently been isolated from a clinical specimen; reports of infection with A. ursingii in children are rare. A. ursingii should be kept in mind as an opportunistic microorganism in children. "

TITLE:Near-drowning-associated pneumonia with bacteremia caused by coinfection with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Edwardsiella tarda in a healthy white man: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Edwardsiella tarda is an Enterobacteriaceae found in aquatic environments. Extraintestinal infections caused by Edwardsiella tarda in humans are rare and occur in the presence of some risk factors. As far as we know, this is the first case of near-drowning-associated pneumonia with bacteremia caused by coinfection with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Edwardsiella tarda in a healthy patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old previously healthy white man had an episode of fresh water drowning after acute alcohol consumption. Edwardsiella tarda and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were isolated in both tracheal aspirate cultures and blood cultures. 
CONCLUSION: This case shows that Edwardsiella tarda is an important pathogen in near drowning even in healthy individuals, and not only in the presence of risk factors, as previously known."

TITLE:Multidrug-resistant oral Capnocytophaga gingivalis responsible for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Capnocytophaga genus was recently known to highly contribute to the beta-lactam (BL) and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance gene reservoir in the oral microbiota (BL: blaCSP-1 and blaCfxA; MLS: erm(F) and erm(C)). But fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance remains uncommon in literature, without available data on resistance mechanisms. CASE REPORT: For the first time, a case of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was described in a 78-year-old immunocompetent patient due to a multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga gingivalis isolate with significant microbiological finding. C.gingivalis acquired resistance to third generation cephalosporins (blaCfxA3 gene), MLS (erm(F) gene), and fluoroquinolones. Genetics of the resistance, unknown as regards fluoroquinolone, was investigated and a substitution in QRDR of GyrA was described (Gly80Asn substitution) for the first time in the Capnocytophaga genus. LITERATURE REVIEW: A comprehensive literature review of Capnocytophaga spp. extra-oral infection was conducted. Including the present report, on 43 cases, 7 isolates were BL-resistant (17%), 4 isolates were MLS-resistant (9.5%) and 4 isolates were FQ-resistant (9.5%). The studied clinical isolate of C.gingivalis was the only one to combine resistance to the three groups of antibiotics BL, MLS and FQ. Four cases of Capnocytophaga lung infection were reported, including three infections involving C. gingivalis (two FQ resistant) and one involving C. sputigena. 
CONCLUSION: This multidrug-resistant C. gingivalis isolate illustrated the role of oral flora as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance and its contribution to the limitation of effective antibiotics in severe respiratory infections."

TITLE:Multidrug resistance Acinetobacter species at the intensive care unit, Aseer Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia: A one year analysis.
ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: To identify and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) clinical isolates from ICU at Aseer Central Hospital. 
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit, Aseer Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia over 13 months period (2014-2015). Acinetobacter species (n = 105) were isolated from various clinical samples. Isolates were identified using selected phenotypic criteria and confirmed using the Vitek 2 automated system. This system was used to determine the susceptibilities of 21 antimicrobial agents. Patients, isolates and drug data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package to determine some epidemiological and microbiological patterns. 
RESULTS: Of the 105 stains, A. baumannii accounted for 49 (46.67%), A. baumannii complex, 19 (18.09%), A. baumannii/haemolyticus 32 (30.47), Acinetobacter haemolyticus 4 (3.81%), Acinetobater lwoffii 1 (0.95%) and unidentified Acinetobater species 2 (1.3%). Of the 105 Acinetobacter strains, 103 (98.1%) were found multidrug resistant (MDR). A. baumannii strain were 100% sensitive to colistin and 74.5% to trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole. The remaining 19 antimicrobial agents revealed low or no sensitivities: amikacin 16.3%; ampicillin 7.7%; ceftazidime, 7.3%. Distribution of similar sensitivities was shown by other Acinetobacter species. Mean number of isolates from males and females indicates no statistical variation (P = 0.867) whereas age groups showed significant differences (P = 0.008) as it is clear from the high percentage of infected individuals more than 60 years followed by those aged 20-29 years old (19.05%). Upper respiratory tract (30.48%), lower respiratory tract (47.65%) and subcutaneous tissue (9.5%) were the main sources of Acinetobacter spp. but mean numbers of isolates from these specimens indicate no discrepancy between specimens (P = 0.731). 
CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter species including A. baumannii were found MDR (98.1%) according to the current Acinetobacter spp. antimicrobial categorization. Approximately half of these strains were A. baumannii. All Acinetobacter species were 100% sensitive to colistin and to some extent to trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (74.5%). ICU-acquired pneumonia among patients over 60 years of age who spend prolong times at artificial ventilations made up the majority of the cases."

ABSTRACT:Empedobacter brevis is gram-negative bacilli that belongs to Flavobacteriaceae family. It was previously known with name of Flavobacterium breve. The reservoir of these bacteria is soil, plants, water, food, hospital water sources, including incubators, sinks, faucets, tap water, hemodialysis systems, saline solutions, and other pharmaceutical solutions. We report a case of term female newborn, admitted with complaint of respiratory distress developing soon after birth and developed clinical features of sepsis at age of 92 hours of postnatal life. The sepsis screen was positive and blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid showed growth of Empedobacter brevis that was resistant to multiple antibiotics. The neonate was treated with appropriate antibiotics and was discharged successfully. The novelty of the case report is that this is the first case report of neonatal sepsis caused by Empedobacter brevis. "

ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoU, a type III secretory toxin and major virulence factor with patatin-like phospholipase activity, is responsible for acute lung injury and sepsis in immunocompromised patients. Through use of a recently updated bacterial genome database, protein sequences predicted to be homologous to Ps. aeruginosa ExoU were identified in 17 other Pseudomonas species (Ps. fluorescens, Ps. lundensis, Ps. weihenstephanensis, Ps. marginalis, Ps. rhodesiae, Ps. synxantha, Ps. libanensis, Ps. extremaustralis, Ps. veronii, Ps. simiae, Ps. trivialis, Ps. tolaasii, Ps. orientalis, Ps. taetrolens, Ps. syringae, Ps. viridiflava, and Ps. cannabina) and 8 Gram-negative bacteria from three other genera (Photorhabdus, Aeromonas, and Paludibacterium). In the alignment of the predicted primary amino acid sequences used for the phylogenetic analyses, both highly conserved and nonconserved parts of the toxin were discovered among the various species. Further comparative studies of the predicted ExoU homologs should provide us with more detailed information about the unique characteristics of the Ps. aeruginosa ExoU toxin."

The patient's respiratory condition rapidly worsened and the clinical picture of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome developed with disseminated intravasal coagulopathy and necrosis of the toes. An infection with Capnocytophaga canimorsus, which had been caused by an initially unmentioned dog bite was confirmed. In view of the fulminant course and the high risk of operative treatment of the ubiquitous necroses in all limbs, a joint decision for deescalation of therapy was made together with relatives.

TITLE:Ralstonia mannitolilytica in cystic fibrosis: A new predictor of worse outcomes.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Patients with Cystic Fibrosis are subject to repeated respiratory tract infections, with recent increasing isolation of unusual pathogens. Ralstonia species have lately been isolated at our institution, an organism historically frequently misidentified as Burkholderia or Pseudomonas. The prevalence of Ralstonia spp. in cystic fibrosis populations has yet to be determined, along with its clinical implications. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Seven patients out of the 301 followed at our cystic fibrosis clinic have had Ralstonia strains identified in their respiratory tract. Most strains identified were multi-drug resistant. After aquisition of Ralstonia spp., the patients' clinical course was characterized by more frequent and more severe respiratory infections along with prolonged hospitalizations, greater decline of lung function, and greater mortality. The mortality rate in this group of patients was 86%. No other factor that could explain such a dramatic evolution was identified upon review of patient data. Some of the strains involved were recognized as clones on Pulse Field Electrophoresis Gel, raising the question of person-to-person transmission. 
CONCLUSION: New pathogens are identified with the evolution of the microbiota in cystic fibrosis respiratory tracts. In our cohort of patients, acquisition of Ralstonia spp. was associated with dramatic outcomes in terms of disease acceleration and raised mortality rates. It is of critical importance to continue to better define the prevalence and clinical impact of Ralstonia in cystic fibrosis populations."

TITLE:Ralstonia picketti neonatal sepsis: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Ralstonia genus are gram negative bacillus and includes four bacteria namely Ralstonia picketti, Ralstonia Solanacearum, Ralstonia insidiosa and Ralstonia mannitolilytica. These are opportunistic pathogens and cause infections in immunocompromised host. The sources of infection are usually contaminated solutions and water. The majority of the reported cases are caused by R. picketti. It is very rare cause of neonatal sepsis with less than twenty cases reported in literature till date. CASE PRESENTATION: A late preterm male infant, Indian race was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress developing soon after birth. The infant was managed with respiratory support and gradually infant improved and diagnosis of transient tachypnea of newborn was made. At age of 84 h of postnatal life, the infant developed features of neonatal sepsis and investigations were suggestive of sepsis. The infant was started on intravenous antibiotic, multiple vasopressors and steroids. The blood culture showed growth of multi-drug resistant R. picketti. The antibiotics were changed as per sensitivity pattern and infant was discharged in good condition and was accepting breast feeding at the time of discharge. There was also no other case of R. picketti in the nursery during the same time period. 
CONCLUSION: Ralstonia picketti is an uncommon cause of neonatal sepsis and usually source of infection are contaminated solutions and medical products. The management involves early detection, treatment with appropriate antibiotics and doing surveillance culture to identify the possible source of infection."

TITLE:[Accurate diagnosis of Pseudomonas luteola in routine microbiology laboratory: on the occasion of two isolates].
ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas luteola which was previously known as Chryseomonas luteola; is a gram-negative, non-fermentative, aerobic, motile, non-spore-forming bacillus. It is frequently found as a saprophyte in soil, water and other damp environments and is an opportunistic pathogen in patients with underlying medical disorders or with indwelling catheters. It has been reported as an uncommon cause of bacteremia, sepsis, septic arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, and peritonitis. Thus, early and accurate identification of this rare species is important for the treatment and also to provide information about the epidemiology of P.luteola infections. This report was aimed to draw attention to the accurate identification of P.luteola in clinical samples, upon the isolation and identification in two cases in the medical microbiology laboratory of a university hospital. In February 2011, a 66-year-old man, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia, was admitted to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea. A chest tube was inserted on the 20th day of admission by the reason of recurrent pleural effusion. Staphylococcus aureus and a non-fermentative gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) with wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies were isolated from the pleural fluid sample obtained on the 9th day following the insertion of the chest tube. In February 2012, a 7-year-old male cystic fibrosis patient who had no signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary exacerbation was admitted to the hospital for a routine control. This patient had chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.aureus and his sputum sample obtained at this visit revealed isolation of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus, Aspergillus fumigatus and a wrinkled, sticky yellow NFGNB. Both of these NFGNB were identified as P.luteola by the Phoenix automated microbial identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA). To evaluate the microbiological characteristics of these two isolates, the strains were further analysed by VITEK MS (bioMerieux, France) and Microflex LT mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Both of the MALDI-TOF-MS systems identified the isolates as P.luteola and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (ABI PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems, USA) also confirmed the identification. The strains had wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies which were oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and non-fermentative. The Gram stained smears of the colonies revealed clusters of gram-negative bacilli probably embedded into a biofilm matrix. Since there are no accepted standards for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of P.luteola strains, the standards determined by CLSI for ""other non-Enterobacteriaceae"" (non-fermentative bacteria excluding P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Burkholderia cepacia, B.mallei, B.pseudomallei and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were used for the susceptibility testing. Gradient MIC method (E-Test, bioMerieux, France) revealed that the isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, colistin and levofloxacin. Accurate and prompt identification of P.luteola which is identified as a rare pathogen in serious cases is of critical importance since it has been suggested that this organism is likely to become more frequent as a nosocomial pathogen since the interventional processes increase in current medical practice. This report supported that Phoenix automated phenotypic identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA) and the two MALDI-TOF-MS based systems (VITEK MS and Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer) were successfull in the accurate identification of P.luteola."

TITLE:First time identification of Pandoraea sputorum from a patient with cystic fibrosis in Argentina: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pandoraea species are considered emerging pathogens in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) and are difficult to identify by conventional biochemical methods. These multidrug resistant bacteria remain poorly understood particularly in terms of natural resistance, mechanisms of acquired resistance and impact on the prognosis of the disease and the lung function. Among them, Pandoraea sputorum has been previously described in few cases of CF patients from Spain, Australia, France and United States, underlining the need of more clinical data for a better knowledge of its pathogenicity. This is the first report relating to P. sputorum in a CF patient in Argentina. CASE PRESENTATION: Pandoraea sputorum was identified in a nine-year-old cystic fibrosis patient from Argentina, after treatment failure during an exacerbation. The isolates were successfully identified by combining molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) methods, after reassessing previous misidentified isolates by conventional methods. After first isolation of P. sputorum, patient's clinical condition worsened but later improved after a change in the treatment. Although isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem, in our case, the antibiotic treatment failed in the eradication of P. sputorum. 
CONCLUSIONS: All combined data showed a chronic colonization with P. sputorum associated to a deterioration of lung function. We noted that the presence of P. sputorum can be underestimated in CF patients and MALDI-TOF MS appears to be a promising means of accurate identification of Pandoraea species."

TITLE:First report of cavitary pneumonia due to community-acquired Acinetobacter pittii, study of virulence and overview of pathogenesis and treatment.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter pittii is a nosocomial pathogen rarely involved in community-acquired infections. We report for the first time that A. pittii can be responsible for cavitary community-acquired pneumonia and study its virulence, and discuss its pathogenesis and treatment options. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old woman with a history of smoking and systemic lupus was admitted to Nimes University Hospital (France) with coughing and sputum lasting for three weeks. Thoracic CT scanner showed cavitary pneumonia. Broncho-alveolar lavage cultures found community-acquired Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. The clinical outcome was favourable after twenty-one days of antimicrobial treatment by piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin then cefepime. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses identified an A. pittii ST249. Despite the atypical clinical presentation with an unexpected partial destruction of lung parenchyma, we found very low virulence potential of the A. pittii strain with nematode killing assays and biofilm formation test. The median time required to kill 50% of the nematodes was 7 +- 0.3 days for A. pittii ST249, 7 +- 0.2 days for A. baumanii NAB ST2 and 8 +- 0.2 days for E. coli OP50, (p &gt; 0,05). A. pittii ST249 showed significantly slower biofilm formation than A. baumanii NAB ST2: BFI = 8.83 +- 0.59 vs 3.93 +- 0.27 at 2 h (p &lt; 0.0001), BFI = 6.3 +- 0.17 vs 1.87 +- 0.12 at 3 h (p &lt; 0.0001) and BFI = 3.67 +- 0.41 vs 1.7 +- 0.06 after 4 h of incubation (p &lt; 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired A. pittii should be considered as possible cause of sub-acute cavitary pneumonia particularly in a smoking and/or immunocompromised patient despite its low virulence potential."

TITLE:Clinical characteristics of bacteraemia caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates in a medical centre in Taiwan.
ABSTRACT:This study investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of bacteraemia due to Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) species among 54 patients without cystic fibrosis from January 2013 to February 2015. BCC isolates were identified to the species level by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system and by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Sequencing of the recA gene in the 54 blood isolates revealed 37 (68.5%) isolates of B. cenocepacia, 9 (16.7%) of B. cepacia, 4 (7.4%) of B. multivorans and one isolate each of B. arboris, B. pseudomultivorans, B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis. The overall performance of the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system for correctly identifying the 54 BCC isolates to the species level was 79.6%, which was better than that (16.7%) by 16S RNA sequencing analysis. Bacteraemic pneumonia (n = 23, 42.6%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (n = 21, 38.9%) were the most common types of infection. Higher rates of ceftazidime and meropenem resistance were found in B. cepacia isolates (33.3% and 22.2%, respectively) than in isolates of B. cenocepacia (21.6% and 10.8%, respectively) and other species (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively). Overall, the 30-day mortality rate was 38.9% (21/54). Bacteraemia caused by BCC species other than B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 20.005, P = 0.024) and high SOFA score (aOR 1.412, P = 0.003) were predictive of higher 30-day mortality. Different BCC species are associated with different outcomes of bacteraemia and exhibit different susceptibility patterns."

TITLE:Exacerbation of bronchiectasis by Pseudomonas monteilii: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas spp are important opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens. One such species is Pseudomonas monteilii (P. monteilii). It has been described as an environmental contaminant and potential pathogen. We identified this organism as the causative agent of an exacerbation of bronchiectasis and an environmental contaminant in our hospital on two separate occasions. CASE PRESENTATION: P. monteilii was the cause of an exacerbation of bronchiectasis in a 30-year-old HIV negative male. Patient presented with cough with sputum production and exertional dyspnea. The isolate was recovered from a sputum sample in significant counts and definitively identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation- Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). He was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and recovered clinically and microbiologically. Another two isolates of the organism were contaminants from the hospital environment. The three isolates were susceptible to all tested antibiotics. Typing by Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) found no clonal relationship between them. 
CONCLUSIONS: Less common species of Pseudomonas need to be identified accurately. This organism is identified by commonly used phenotypic systems as P. putida which may have contributed to a lower reported prevalence. P. monteilii is a known environmental contaminant and must also be considered as a potential pathogen, particularly in patients with chronic lung disease."

TITLE:Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Pantoea agglomerans infection in children.
ABSTRACT:Pantoea agglomerans is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium that rarely is responsible for the infections in humans but it is often a causative factor of a number of occupational diseases. This study evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics and pathogenicity of P. agglomerans in children. We retrospectively reviewed microbiological test results for all children (1 month old to 18 years old) who were admitted to our pediatric hospital between January 2000 to June 2015 and had positive clinical specimen cultures for P. agglomerans. Isolates were identified using conventional tests and the BBL Crystal E/NF ID or MALDI-TOF MS systems. Antibiotic susceptibilities were evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. We identified fifteen positive cultures from 14 patients with confirmed infections. The positive specimens included pus, urine, tracheal aspirate, blood, and central venous line samples that yielded P. agglomerans. The median patient age was 8.8 years (range: 1.5 months to 16.5 years), and all patients had underlying comorbidities. Five patients had medical devices, and two devices were removed. The most common P. agglomerans infections involved wound infections (35.7%), pneumonia (21.4%), and urinary tract infections (21.4%). Three patients had concomitant infections (Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus). Five patients had anemia. Three patients (21.4%) died, and all three had carbapenem-resistant P. agglomerans that was detected after the first week of hospitalization; two cases involved pneumonia, which was ineffectively treated. P. agglomerans infections may be life-threatening, especially in young patients with pneumonia. Hospital-acquired P. agglomerans may have different pathogenicity and clinical features, compared to community-acquired P. agglomerans, although further studies are needed to understand the drug-resistance patterns in this bacterium."

ABSTRACT:A 46-year-old man was admitted to ICU with a diagnosis at the time of admission of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) and sepsis due to suspected Ventilator-Associated Pneumoniae (VAP). Specimens for the following laboratory workup were inquired, i.e. complete blood count, culture and resistance workup using specimens obtained from the tip of suction pipe, urinalysis and urine culture, blood culture and resistance, procalcitonin and lactate levels. Neutrophilia was found along with increased procalcitonin and lactate levels, which supported the sepsis diagnosis. Moreover, the result of culture from suction pipe demonstrated colonies of Pseudomonas luteola MDRO, which might be originated from the oropharyngeal colonization of the patients due to poor oral hygiene and ineffective oral hygiene nursing; therefore, the colonies of the microorganism were swabbed away when obtaining the specimens. Ineffective oral hygiene nursing may have a potency to cause VAP and recurrent VAP."

TITLE:Ralstonia infection in cystic fibrosis.
ABSTRACT:This study aimed to determine prevalence of Ralstonia spp. in cystic fibrosis patients, look for any evidence of cross infection and to describe clinical outcomes for patients infected by Ralstonia spp. Prevalence of Ralstonia spp. was calculated annually from 2008 to 2016. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed on &gt;=1 sample from patients with an isolation of Ralstonia spp. between 2008 and 2016. A prospective, longitudinal observational study of adult patients was performed with 12 months follow-up from recruitment. Prevalence of Ralstonia spp. rose from 0 6% in 2008 to 2 4% in 2016. In total 12 out of 14 (86%) patients with &gt;=1 isolation of Ralstonia spp. developed chronic infection. A pair and a group of three unrelated patients with epidemiological connections shared strains of Ralstonia mannitolilytica. Lung function of Ralstonia spp. infected patients was moderately to severely impaired. Prevalence of Ralstonia spp. is low but increasing. The risk of a patient developing chronic Ralstonia spp. infection following first acquisition is high and cross-infection may be possible. Whether Ralstonia spp. infection causes increased pulmonary exacerbation frequency and lung function decline needs to be evaluated in larger prospective studies."

TITLE:Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis in a methotrexate-treated patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
ABSTRACT:Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative rod that can be transmitted primarily by dog bites. This life-threatening organism commonly causes sepsis in patients with splenectomy or alcoholism. A 53-year-old rheumatoid arthritis male treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years was admitted for a 4-day history of fever and dyspnea. He had been bitten on a finger by the family dog 4 days before onset. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and he subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, blood cultures grew gram-negative bacilli and despite intensive treatment, he died 5 days after admission. Later, C. canimorsus was identified from his culture samples using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction. C. canimorsus infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis for immunocompromised hosts following animal bites."

TITLE:Sphingobacterium spiritivorum bacteremia due to cellulitis in an elderly man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Sphingobacterium spiritivorum is a glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rod, formerly classified as one of the Flavobacterium species. It is characterized by a large number of cellular membrane sphingophospholipids. Sphingobacterium species are ubiquitous and isolated from natural environments, such as soil and water. However, they rarely cause infections in humans. Only a limited number of cases have been reported in elderly and immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases and predisposing factors. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Japanese man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure visited the Kariya Toyota General Hospital, Aichi, Japan with the chief complaint of fever accompanied by chills and left leg pain. At initial presentation, he was distressed and dyspneic. He was febrile (38.8  C), and his left foot was swollen with reddening and tenderness. We diagnosed him as having cellulitis, and he was hospitalized for antibiotic therapy. Initially, he was treated with intravenously administered cefazolin, but after the isolation of a glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rod from blood cultures, we decided to switch cefazolin to intravenously administered meropenem on day 4, considering the antibiotic resistance of the causative organism. The causative organism was identified as S. spiritivorum on day 6. His condition gradually stabilized after admission. Meropenem was switched to orally administered levofloxacin on day 12. He was discharged on day 16 and treated successfully without any complications. 
CONCLUSIONS: Although S. spiritivorum is rare, with limited cases isolated from cellulitis, it should be considered as a causative organism in elderly and immunocompromised patients with cellulitis. Blood cultures are the key to correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

TITLE:Comparative analysis of clinics, pathologies and immune responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice infected with Streptobacillus moniliformis.
ABSTRACT:Streptobacillus (S.) moniliformis is a rat-associated zoonotic pathogen that occasionally causes disease in other species. We investigated the working hypothesis that intranasal infection might lead to different immune responses in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice associated with distinct pathologies. This study confirmed with 75% mortality the known high susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice to Streptobacillus moniliformis infection in comparison to BALB/c mice which did not develop signs of disease. Main pathologies in C57BL/6 mice were purulent to necrotizing lymphadenitis and pneumonia. Significant seroconversion was recorded in surviving mice of both strains. Differentiation of IgG-subclasses revealed mean ratios of IgG2b to IgG1 below 0.5 in sera of all mice prior to infection and of BALB/c mice post infection. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice had a mean IgG2b/IgG1 ratio of 2.5 post infection indicating a Th1 immune response in C57BL/6 versus a Th2 response in BALB/c mice. Evaluation of different sentinel systems revealed that cultural and serological investigations of these animals might not be sufficient to detect infection. In summary, an intranasal S. moniliformis infection model in C57BL/6 mice leading to purulent to necrotizing inflammations in the lung, the lymph nodes and other organs associated with a Th1 immune response is described."

ABSTRACT:Citrobacter koseri is a gram-negative bacillius that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is an uncommon pathogen that typically causes meningitis and brain abscesses in children, however central nervous system (CNS) infections are rarely found in adults. We present a case of C. koseri meningitis in an immunocompetent adult secondary to intestinal micro-perforation caused by Strongyloides A 76-year-old man admitted for asthma exacerbation developed septic shock. A lumbar puncture revealed bacterial meningitis. Blood and CSF cultures grew Citrobacter koseri with identical susceptibilities, suggesting infection by one strain. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient expired of multi-organ failure. Autopsy identified diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as the immedi ate cause of death with a heavy burden of Strongyloides stercoralis in his gastrointestinal system, lungs, and meninges. Citrobacter koseri is a gram-negative bacillus of the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is an uncommon pathogen that typically causes meningitis and brain abscesses in children. Infections in adults occur in immunocompromised hosts or instances where an insult creates a port of entry. This is the first documented case of C.koseri sepsis in an immunocompetent host associated with Strongyloides Hyperinfection Syndrome (SHS), where massive parasitic intestinal invasion reaches pulmonary circulation and perforates the alveolar membrane. This case highlights that presence of rare enterobacterial infections should prompt consideration of differentials including SHS."

ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: To date, at least 50 species of Legionella have been described. These organisms are ubiquitous in nature and have been isolated from diverse ecological environments, including man-made structures such as cooling towers and spas. Legionellae have also been isolated from human and veterinary clinical specimens, and their roles in disease are well-established. This report describes the isolation of a novel Legionella species from a respiratory specimen from a patient with influenza and suspected pulmonary embolus. CASE: A 68-year-old male presented to an Indianapolis-area hospital with pulmonary disease; upon workup, he was found to have influenza A. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also submitted for conventional bacterial culture and Legionella culture. The patient was prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic and recovered. 
RESULTS: A Legionella-like bacterium was isolated on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, and mass spectrometry and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing inconclusively identified the isolate as a Legionella sp. Further analysis of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the strain to be a new species, related to Legionella hackeliae. Physiochemical and morphological testing were used to confirm the discovery of a novel species, Legionella indianapolisensis sp. nov., type strain SMNF-IS."

TITLE:On Burkholderiales order microorganisms and cystic fibrosis in Russia.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Microbes infecting cystic fibrosis patients' respiratory tract are important in determining patients' functional status. Representatives of Burkholderiales order are the most dangerous. The goal of our investigation was to reveal the diversity of Burkholderiales, define of their proportion in the microbiome of various parts of respiratory tract and determine the pathogenicity of the main representatives. 
RESULTS: In more than 500 cystic fibrosis patients, representing all Federal Regions of Russia, 34.0% were infected by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), 21.0% by Achromobacter spp. and 12.0% by Lautropia mirabilis. B. cenocepacia was the most numerous species among the Bcc (93.0%), and A. ruhlandii was the most numerous among Achromobacter spp. (58.0%). The most abundant genotype in Bcc was sequence type (ST) 709, and in Achromobacter spp. it was ST36. These STs constitute Russian epidemic strains. Whole genome sequencing of strains A. ruhlandii SCCH3:Ach33-1365 ST36 and B. cenocepacia GIMC4560:Bcn122 ST709 revealed huge resistomes and many virulence factors, which may explain the difficulties in eradicating these strains. An experience of less dangerous B. cenocepcia ST710 elimination was described. Massively parallel sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons, including V1-V4 hypervariable regions, was used to definite ""healthy"" microbiome characteristics. Analysis of maxillary sinus lavage of 7 patients revealed infection with Proteobacteria of the same ST as pathogens from sputum, suggesting that the maxillary sinus is a source of infection in cystic fibrosis patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of the Russian epidemic bacterial strains in the sputum and sinuses of cystic fibrosis patients have better defined the importance of Burkholderiales bacteria. This information may aid in the development of effective approaches for treatment of this disease."

TITLE:Lung abscess following bronchoscopy due to multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga sputigena adjacent to lung cancer with high PD-L1 expression.
ABSTRACT:Lung abscess following flexible bronchoscopy is a rare and sometimes fatal iatrogenic complication. Here, we report the first case of a lung abscess caused by multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga sputigena following bronchoscopy. A 67-year-old man underwent bronchoscopy to evaluate a lung mass. Seven days after transbronchial lung biopsy, he presented with an abscess formation in a lung mass. Empirical antibiotic therapy, including with garenoxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and cefepime, was ineffective. Percutaneous needle aspiration of lung abscess yielded C. sputigena resistant to multiple antibiotics but remained susceptible to carbapenem. He was successfully treated by the combination therapy with surgery and with approximately 6 weeks of intravenous carbapenem. Finally he was diagnosed with a lung abscess with adenocarcinoma expressing high levels of programmed cell death ligand 1. The emergence of multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga species is a serious concern for effective antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians should consider multidrug-resistant C. sputigena as a causative pathogen of lung abscess when it is refractory to antimicrobial treatment."

TITLE:A Fatal Case of Community Acquired Cupriavidus Pauculus Pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Introduction: Cupriavidus pauculus is a rarely isolated non-fermentative, aerobic bacillus, which occasionally causes severe human infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Strains have been isolated from various clinical and environmental sources. Case presentation: A 67-year-old man was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory failure. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, pulmonary sepsis and underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Examination revealed diminished bilateral vesicular breath sounds, fever, intense yellow tracheal secretions, a respiratory rate of 24/minute, a heart rate of 123/minute, and blood pressure of 75/55 mmHg. Vasoactive treatment was initiated. Investigations revealed elevated lactate and C-reactive protein levels. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration. Parenteral ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were administered. Tracheal aspirate culture and blood culture showed bacterial growth of Cupriavidus pauculus. Colistin was added to the treatment. There was a poor clinical response despite repeated blood culture showing negative results. The diagnosis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by C. pauculus was made. The patient died eleven days after admission. Conclusions: Clinical improvement cannot always be expected in spite of targeted antibiotic therapy. This pathogen should be considered responsible for infections that usually develop in immunocompromised patients."

TITLE:Rare Shewanella spp. associated with pulmonary and bloodstream infections of cancer patients, China: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Members of Shewanella species are opportunistic pathogens that are found in marine environments. Currently more than sixty species have been identified, whereas the most commonly clinical cases associated with Shewanella species have involved only two species, i.e., S. algae and S. putrefaciens. We present two cases of pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by two rare Shewanella spp. strains from patients of gastrointestinal cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: Two male patients with a history of gastrointestinal cancer presented to hospital with pulmonary and bloodstream infections, respectively. The infective pathogens of both cases were primarily isolated and identified as Shewanella algae (case I) and Shewanella putrefaciens (case II) by phenotypic features and VITEK 2 system, but they were further confirmed as Shewanella haliotis and Shewanella upenei by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The major bacterial composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage in case I was also identified as Shewanella by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the two strains had broad susceptibility, but S. haliotis in the case I was resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and S. upenei in the case II was intermediate to imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. 
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cases of the pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by Shewanella spp. from clinical patients in mainland China. Shewanella as a potential pathogen in China should not be ignored."

TITLE:Leclercia adecarboxylata: a case report and literature review of 74 cases demonstrating its pathogenicity in immunocompromised patients.
ABSTRACT:Leclercia adecarboxylata is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It has been described as an emerging human pathogen with the potential to cause severe infection in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to describe a clinical case of infection with L. adecarboxylata and give a review of previous reports on infection. We report the presence of L. adecarboxylata in a patient initially admitted to our hospital for a lung transplant. She had diarrhoea, urinary tract infection and pneumonia caused by L. adecarboxylata. The isolate was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to 15 other antibiotics tested. The literature search for previous reports of infection with L. adecarboxylata resulted in 61 publications describing 74 cases. Bacteremia and wound infections were most often described, and only a few cases were fatal. L. adecarboxylata was most often found as a monomicrobial infection in immunocompromised patients, and as part of a polymicrobial infection in immunocompetent patients. The previously described isolates showed a high susceptibility to antibiotics, and treatment was efficient in most cases. Due to similarities in metabolic products, L. adecarboxylata might have been mistaken as Escherichia spp., but with new identification methods such as MALDI-TOF MS, it is possible to obtain a certain identification."

TITLE:Delftia acidovorans: A rare cause of septic pulmonary embolism from catheter-related infection: Case report and literature review.
ABSTRACT:Septic pulmonary emboli is a rare condition due to the dislodgement of an infected thrombus traveling to the pulmonary vasculature via the venous system. Staphylococcus spp. and Candida spp. are the most common causative agents. The most common risk factor is intravenous drug abuse, but there has been an association with intravenous catheters. Delftia acidovorans (DA) is a rare organism causing catheter-related infection, which has a tendency to embolize and clog up major vessels. It is highly resistant to all available aminoglycoside agents. There are only a few cases reported in children showing DA as a cause of septic emboli with none of the cases reported in a young patient. We report a similar case but in a young adult who developed septic emboli due to DA that was caused by an infected peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Since the organism is highly susceptible to recurrent embolization, the PICC line was removed and the patient was treated successfully with an appropriate antibiotic regime."

TITLE:What is the role of Ewingella americana in humans? A case report in a healthy 4-year-old girl.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Ewingella americana (Ea) is a Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting, oxidase-negative and catalase-positive bacterium that was first described in 1983 as a new genus and species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is not known whether Ea is a true pathogen or simply an opportunistic infectious agent, as most of the cases have been described in patients at risk. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old girl described here was hospitalized due to a productive cough over the previous 3 weeks and a fever &gt; 38  C associated with tachypnea over the previous 2 days. Her familial and personal medical histories were negative for relevant diseases, including respiratory infections. At admission, she was febrile (axillary temperature 39.2  C) and had dyspnea with retractions, grunting and nasal flaring. A chest examination revealed fine crackling rales in the left upper field associated with bilateral wheezing. A chest X-ray revealed segmental consolidation of the lingula of the left lung. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (15.,800 white blood cells/mm3 with 50.3% neutrophils), a slight increase in serum C-reactive protein (11.9 mg/L) and normal procalcitonin values (&lt; 0.12 ng/mL). A nasopharyngeal swab culture did not reveal viral or bacterial respiratory pathogens, including atypical bacteria. A blood culture revealed the presence of a Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rod that was oxidase negative and catalase positive. The isolate was identified by means of the VITEK 2 identification system (bioMerieux, Firenze, Italy) as Ea. This identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16 s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). The pathogen was sensitive to aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime but was intermediate against sulfametoxazole/trimethoprim and resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, fosfomycin, and oxacillin. The child was immediately treated orally with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and erythromycin. Based on the results of a blood culture and sensitivity tests, the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid medication was stopped after 3 days. Erythromycin was continued for a total of 10 days, and the child was discharged after 3 days in the hospital. Follow-up visit 1 month later did not reveal any respiratory problems. 
CONCLUSION: This case shows that Ea infections in healthy subjects are mild even in pediatric age, and the need for antibiotic therapy is debated. Cases occurring in subjects with underlying chronic disease can be significantly more complicated and require appropriate antibiotic therapy."

TITLE:Legionella co-infection in HIV-associated pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Due to poor diagnostics and increased co-infections, HIV-associated Legionella infections are underreported. We aimed to retrospectively determine the frequency of Legionella infections in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from HIV-associated pneumonia patients hospitalized in Medellin, Colombia, between February 2007 and April 2014. Although culture was negative, 17 BAL (36%) were positive for Legionella by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, most of which were in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Pneumocystis jirovecii co-infected patients, and included L. anisa (n = 6), L. bozemanae (n = 4), L. pneumophila (n = 3), and L. micdadei (n = 2). All L. bozemanae and L. micdadei associated with Pneumocystis, while all L. pneumophila associated with M. tuberculosis. Legionella probable cases had more complications and higher mortality rates (P = 0.02) and were rarely administered empirical anti-Legionella therapy while in hospital. Clinicians should be aware of the possible presence of Legionella in HIV and M. tuberculosis or P. jirovecii co-infected patients."

ABSTRACT:Rahnella aquatilis, a saprophytic organism, is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The natural habitat of this organism is fresh water, and it is rarely found in clinical specimens. Clinical conditions ascribed to this organism include bacteremia, respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, wound infection in an immunocompromised host, and infective endocarditis in patients with congenital heart diseases. Here, we report a case of bacteremia due to R. aquatilis in a woman with breast cancer who had received chemotherapy through a chemoport. To our knowledge, this is the second case of bacteremia caused by this organism in a patient with cancer in Korea."

TITLE:Clinical and molecular characteristics of Klebsiella pneumoniae causing bloodstream infections in Japan: occurrence of hypervirulent infections in healthcare.
ABSTRACT:Although hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) have been associated with severe community-acquired infections that occur among relatively healthy individuals, information about hvKp infections in healthcare settings remains limited. Here we systematically analyzed the clinical and molecular characteristics of K. pneumoniae isolates causing bloodstream infections in a cross-sectional study. Clinical characteristics of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections from hospitals across Japan were analyzed by review of medical records. Whole-genome sequencing of the causative isolates was performed. Bacterial species were confirmed and hvKp were identified using whole-genome sequencing data. Clinical characteristics of hvKp infections were compared with non-hvKp infections by bivariable analyses. Of 140 cases of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections, 26 cases (18.6%) were caused by various clones of hvKp defined by the carriage of cardinal virulence genes. Molecular identification revealed that 24 (17.1%) and 14 cases (10%) were caused by Klebsiella variicola and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, respectively. Patients with hvKp infections had higher proportions of diabetes mellitus (Risk ratio [RR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.94), and their infection had significantly higher propensity to involve pneumonia (RR, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.39-24.6), liver abscess (RR, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.39-24.6), and disseminated infections (RR, 6.58; 95% CI, 1.16-37.4) compared with those infected by other isolates. More than half of hvKp infections were healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired, and a probable event of healthcare-associated transmission of hvKp was documented. hvKp isolates, which are significantly associated with severe and disseminated infections, are frequently involved in healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired infections in Japan."

TITLE:Leclercia adecarboxylata Cholecystitis with Septic Shock in Immunocompetent Patient.
ABSTRACT:L. adecarboxylata is a Gram-negative rod previously named Escherichia adecarboxylata, isolated as normal flora in the gut of animals including human stool. Most reported cases refer to immunocompromised patients with polymicrobial infections and water environments. Here we present a case of 51-year-old immunocompetent female presented with nausea, vomiting, malaise, and subjective fever for few days. On examination, she was drowsy but arousable and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Her abdomen was tender globally and more tender in the epigastric area. Vitals showed a temperature of 37 C, pulse of 110 beats/min, blood pressure of 75/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. An HIV panel and hepatitis panel were negative. Liver and gallbladder ultrasound was performed, revealing multiple nonmobile stones with shadowing noted within the gallbladder sac, a thickened gallbladder wall, and a moderate amount of pericholecystic fluid. Broad spectrum antibiotics, crystalloid fluids, and vasopressors were initiated. A few hours after admission she developed respiratory failure for which she underwent endotracheal intubation. An ultrasound guided gallbladder drain was performed. Culture of the biliary fluid yielded pure growth of pan-sensitive L. adecarboxylata; antibiotics were narrowed accordingly. The patient was on the maximum doses of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine with a blood pressure of 75/45 and a mean arterial pressure of 51. She passed away on the fourth day of admission."

TITLE:Ralstonia pickettii Bacteremia: An Emerging Infection in a Tertiary Care Hospital Setting.
ABSTRACT:Ralstonia species are Gram-negative bacilli that have increasingly been recognized as emerging nosocomial pathogens, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Ralstonia pickettii is the most clinically important pathogen from the Ralstonia genus. Nosocomial outbreaks of Ralstonia pickettii infections brought about by the use of contaminated medical solutions, including saline, sterile water, as well as disinfectants, have been reported. There have been case reports of invasive infections with variable presentations. Here, we describe three cases of Ralstonia pickettii bacteremia during a period of one year in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. The first case was a 76-year-old male, known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who presented with complaints of burning micturition, hematuria, and fever. The patient had a history of multiple hospital admissions in the recent past. His blood culture was found to be positive for Ralstonia pickettii. A computed tomography scan of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (CT KUB) was suggestive of pyelonephritis. The patient improved on intravenous meropenem. The second case was a 47-year-old man, who was admitted with a gunshot injury to the neck, resulting in complete cervical cord resection and mild hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient had a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, which was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia with Acinetobacter and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) with Ralstonia pickettii. He was treated with meropenem and colistin but continued to deteriorate and expired. The third case was a 46-year-old lady, known case of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who was admitted with prosthetic valve endocarditis. She had a prolonged hospital stay complicated by CLABSI with Ralstonia pickettii, improved on meropenem, but later died due to fungemia. Ralstonia pickettii is an emerging cause of nosocomial infection in patients, particularly those with a prolonged hospital stay, and can cause invasive and severe infections."

TITLE:Distribution of Legionella species and serogroups in patients with culture-confirmed Legionella pneumonia.
ABSTRACT:Legionella species are consistently identified as some of the most common causative agents of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial pneumonia. Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup."

TITLE:Microbiological profile of ventilator-associated pneumonia among intensive care unit patients in tertiary Egyptian hospitals.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the common serious infectious diseases encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU), which highly affects the healthcare cost and patient prognosis. VAP is caused by various antimicrobial-resistant aetiological agents and the clinical manifestations lack sensitivity and specificity, making the prompt treatment is a challenge. This study aimed to investigate the microbial profile of VAP causing microorganisms among ICU patients in Egypt, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the genetic diversity among the frequently isolated organisms. METHODOLOGY: Throughout the period from August 2016 to August 2017, endotracheal aspirate (ETA) specimens were collected from ICU patients with clinically suspected VAP in two tertiary hospitals in Cairo. ETA specimens were investigated for the microbial content. The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Kirby-Bauer method. ERIC-PCR was performed for genotyping. 
RESULTS: Fifty microbiologically confirmed VAP cases were identified. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Klebsiella spp., followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii. Candida spp. was the most isolated fungi. A single isolate of each Cupriavidus pauculus and Aeromonas salmonicida was isolated. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles indicated 40% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). ERIC-PCR revealed no genetic relatedness among K. pneumoniae isolates, the most frequently isolated microorganism. 
CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are the main causative agents of VAP cases, which mostly are MDR. Microorganisms like C. pauculus and A. salmonicida should be taken into consideration as VAP causative agents. There was no common source of infection suggesting likely endogenous sources of K. pneumoniae, the main causative agent of VAP in this study."

TITLE:[MORAXELLA OSLOENSIS BACTEREMIA WITH PNEUMONIA: FIRST REPORTED CASE IN ISRAEL].
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP), an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma acquired in the community, is generally treated in an outpatient setting and involves different etiological agents. In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests. Our patient showed remarkable clinical and laboratory improvement with the therapy mentioned above."

TITLE:Isolation of Bordetella trematum from the respiratory tract of a patient with lung cancer: a case report.
ABSTRACT:We report the case of isolation of Bordetella trematum from the respiratory tract of a patient with lung carcinoma. This gram-negative, opportunistic rod was firstly described in 1996. To date, only several strains of Bordetella trematum have been isolated and reported, mostly from skin and soft tissue infections. The patient was admitted to the ICU of the Pulmonary Department in incipient septic shock with respiratory failure. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and non-invasive ventilation were administered immediately. A broad spectrum antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam was administered empirically after sampling of material for microbiological examination. The bronchoscopy showed a large cavern of decayed tumour invading into mediastinum. Both sample cultures showed significant quantities of gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria. The isolate was identified using MALDI-TOF MS as Bordetella trematum and the identification was confirmed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. In the last few years, routine bacterial identification using MALDI-TOF MS has enabled correct discrimination of this species. Nevertheless, isolation of Bordetella trematum in clinical samples is still very uncommon, and it is appropriate to confirm the species identification via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first case of B. trematum isolated from the human respiratory tract since its first description. The clinical significance of Bordetella trematum in the rapid deterioration of the patient's status remains unclear."

TITLE:Ralstonia mannitolilytica, an unusual pathogen in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: a case of neonatal sepsis and literature review.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Premature infants are considered high-risk subgroup for neonatal sepsis due to yet defective immune system, interventions practised and synergy of factors favoring multiple resistance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens to antimicrobial agents. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of late-onset neonatal sepsis in a premature infant caused by an uncommon pathogen; a premature infant of extremely low birth weight had in his 4th week of life severe clinical deterioration with lethargy, fever, pallor, 1 mottling, abdominal distention, tachycardia, and worsening respiratory impairment. Full septic screen was performed, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated and supportive care per needs was provided. Blood cultures (and endotracheal tube tip cultures) isolated meropenem- and gentamicin-resistant strain of rare pathogen Ralstonia mannitolilytica. Ralstonia spp are aerobic, Gram-negative, lactose nonfermenting, oxidase- and catalase-positive bacilli, thriving in water and soil. Ralstonia spp are identified only sporadically as causative agents of neonatal sepsis; to our knowledge this is the second report of neonatal sepsis due to R. mannitolilytica in the literature so far. Our patient was eventually treated (per sensitivity pattern) with intravenous ciprofloxacin, and recovered well from the infection. 
CONCLUSION: We intend to raise awareness among neonatologists with regards to early detection of unusual pathogens, emergence of antibiotic resistance patterns, and obligation for adherence to infection control policies."

ABSTRACT:Case Description: A 52-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints of cough, sputum, fever and fatigue. The patient has been receiving immunosuppressive therapy for thrombocytopenic purpura for 5 years. Clinical Finding: Inspiratory crackles were heard on both hemithorax. Oxygen saturation measured with the pulse oximeter was 97%. Chest X-ray showed diffuse reticular opacities that were more prominent in the upper zones of both lungs. WBC counts were 17,600 mm3 and Platelet counts were 29,000 mm3. Thorax CT showed that there were many thin-walled cavities and millimetric nodules accompanied by ground-glass infiltrates in the upper and middle lobes. Gram staining of bronchial fluid, taken by bronchoscopy, revealed Gram-negative bacilli and intense polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The bacteria were defined as Delftia acidovorans by BD Phoenix automated system. Treatment and outcomes: The patient was hospitalized with suspicion of opportunistic pulmonary infections and cavitary lung disease. After the empirical treatment of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and oral clarithromycin, her clinical and radiological findings significantly regressed, and she was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Clinical Relevance: This is the first example of cavitary pneumonia due to Delftia acidovorans in an immunocompromised patient. We would like to emphasize that Delftia pneumonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary cavitary involvement in such patients."

ABSTRACT:The emergence of resistance against commonly used antibiotics has become a serious global concern. The rapid development of antibiotic resistance exhibited by Enterobacteriaceae has caused an increasing concern regarding untreatable bacterial infections. Here, we isolated four pathogens from a geriatric female patient who was hospitalized for a month with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fever. The organisms isolated from the tracheal aspirates and urine included Klebsiella pneumoniae, pandrug-resistant Providencia rettgeri, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistome analysis indicated that the bacterial isolates from the polymicrobial infection were multiple-drug resitnat and pandrug resistant clones. Molecular characterization revealed presence of blaTEM-1 in K. pneumonaie, P. rettgeri and A. baumannii. The blaTEM-1 and blaNDM-1 genes were present in P. rettgeri and A. baumannii, whereas the blaTEM-1, blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23 traits were present in A. baumannii isolates. The patient has died due to the unavailability of effective antimicrobial treatment for this drug-resistant polymicrobial infection."

ABSTRACT:Exposure to and consumption of brackish water are associated with an elevated risk of infection, hypernatremia, and hypothermia. Minimal data exist to support the diagnosis and treatment of patients with long-term brackish water exposure. We present a case of a patient who spent 5 to 10 d semisubmerged in the Elizabeth River in coastal Virginia. A 55-y-old male presented via ambulance after 5 to 10 d of being ""stuck in the mud."" He was hypernatremic, with a sodium of 176 mEq L-1, hypothermic to 35 C (94.1 F), and hypotensive at 88/50 mm Hg, with a sodium concentration of 176 mEq L-1 and an osmolality of 412 mosm kg-1. He developed pneumonia, with respiratory cultures growing Vibrio parahemolyticus, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Shewanella algae. He had pustules, which grew Aeromonas hydrophilia and Aeromonas caviae. A nasogastric tube was placed. Using suction, 500 mL of coarse sand and gravel was removed from his stomach. Antibiotics and intravenous fluids were given. The patient fully recovered after 3 wk and was discharged to rehabilitation. Exposure to brackish water can present a unique set of infectious and metabolic complications. Initial care should include treatment of metabolic derangements, such as hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and hypothermia, and treatment of infections with antibiotics based on knowledge of the most likely causative organisms."

He developed pneumonia, with respiratory cultures growing Vibrio parahemolyticus, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Shewanella algae. He had pustules, which grew Aeromonas hydrophilia and Aeromonas caviae. A nasogastric tube was placed. Using suction, 500 mL of coarse sand and gravel was removed from his stomach. Antibiotics and intravenous fluids were given. The patient fully recovered after 3 wk and was discharged to rehabilitation. Exposure to brackish water can present a unique set of infectious and metabolic complications. Initial care should include treatment of metabolic derangements, such as hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and hypothermia, and treatment of infections with antibiotics based on knowledge of the most likely causative organisms."

TITLE:Prolonged Brackish Water Exposure: A Case Report.
ABSTRACT:Exposure to and consumption of brackish water are associated with an elevated risk of infection, hypernatremia, and hypothermia. Minimal data exist to support the diagnosis and treatment of patients with long-term brackish water exposure. We present a case of a patient who spent 5 to 10 d semisubmerged in the Elizabeth River in coastal Virginia. A 55-y-old male presented via ambulance after 5 to 10 d of being ""stuck in the mud."" He was hypernatremic, with a sodium of 176 mEq L-1, hypothermic to 35 C (94.1 F), and hypotensive at 88/50 mm Hg, with a sodium concentration of 176 mEq L-1 and an osmolality of 412 mosm kg-1.

TITLE:Rare but Fatal Case of Cavitary Pneumonia Caused by Alcaligenes Faecalis.
ABSTRACT:Alcaligenes faecalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is commonly found in the environment. This pathogen is usually transmitted in the form of droplets through ventilation equipment and nebulizers, but transmission through direct contact has also been documented in few case reports. This pathogen can cause rare but fatal infections including appendicitis, abscesses, meningitis, bloodstream infection, endocarditis, and post-operative endophthalmitis. Pan drug resistance to all commercially available antibiotics has been emerging globally. We present the case of a 66-year-old male who had respiratory failure along with multiple comorbidities. A large cavitary lesion caused by pan drug-resistant Alcaligenes faecalis was found on chest imaging. Despite the treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the clinical outcome was very poor."

TITLE:Clinical and drug resistance characteristics of Providencia stuartii infections in 76 patients.
ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical and drug resistance characteristics of Providencia stuartii infections in the Huainan region of Anhui and provide a reference for the clinical selection of antimicrobial agents. 
METHODS: This single-center retrospective analysis included 76 patients with P. stuartii infection in Huainan during the period from October 2018 to March 2020. The hospital department in which the patients were treated and the drug susceptibility characteristics of the P. stuartii isolates were recorded. 
RESULTS: Among the 76 patients, the lung was the most common site of infection, and intensive care unit was the main hospital department. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase screening revealed expression by all 76 isolates of P. stuartii. Of the 76 isolates, 92.1% exhibited multiple drug resistance or extensive drug resistance. P. stuartii isolates were sensitive to cefepime and imipenem, but not to other beta-lactam antibiotics. Twenty isolates were resistant to all 21 types of antibiotics. Of the 20 patients infected with extensively drug-resistant isolates, nine (45%) died. 
CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance is increasing in P. stuartii. The antimicrobial agent imipenem may be effective for treatment of P. stuartii infections. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and fourth-generation cephalosporins are suitable options for antibiotic therapy."

TITLE:Molecular Epidemiology of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii Complex Isolated From Children at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez.
ABSTRACT:The Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb) complex is regarded as a group of phenotypically indistinguishable opportunistic pathogens responsible for mainly causing hospital-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of isolation of the species that constitute the Acb complex, as well as their susceptibility to antibiotics, and their distribution at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). A total of 88 strains previously identified by Vitek 2 , 40 as Acinetobacter baumannii and 48 as Acb complex were isolated from 52 children from 07, January 2015 to 28, September 2017. A. baumannii accounted for 89.77% (79/88) of the strains; Acinetobacter pittii, 6.82% (6/88); and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, 3.40% (3/88). Most strains were recovered mainly from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency wards. Blood cultures (BC) provided 44.32% (39/88) of strains. The 13.63% (12/88) of strains were associated with primary bacteremia, 3.4% (3/88) with secondary bacteremia, and 2.3% (2/88) with pneumonia. In addition, 44.32% (39/88) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains and, 11.36% (10/88) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). All strains amplified the bla OXA-51 gene; 51.13% (45/88), the bla OXA-23 gene; 4.54% (4/88), the bla OXA-24 gene; and 2.27% (2/88), the bla OXA-58 gene. Plasmid profiles showed that the strains had 1-6 plasmids. The strains were distributed in 52 pulsotypes, and 24 showed identical restriction patterns, with a correlation coefficient of 1.0. Notably, some strains with the same pulsotype were isolated from different patients, wards, or years, suggesting the persistence of more than one clone. Twenty-seven sequence types (STs) were determined for the strains based on a Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme using massive sequencing; the most prevalent was ST 156 (27.27%, 24/88). The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas I-Fb system provided amplification in A. baumannii and A. pittii strains (22.73%, 20/88). This study identified an increased number of MDR strains and the relationship among strains through molecular typing. The data suggest that more than one strain could be causing an infection in some patient. The implementation of molecular epidemiology allowed the characterization of a set of strains and identification of different attributes associated with its distribution in a specific environment."

TITLE:Hafnia alvei pneumonia: a rare cause of infection in the multimorbid or immunocompromised.
ABSTRACT:Hafnia alvei is a rare, poorly understood commensal bacterium which has, on occasion, been shown to infect humans. We present two cases. The first patient presented with a 1-week history of dyspnoea, pleurisy and a productive cough, and the second with a prodrome of fatigue and night sweats. The former had a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the latter had a history of Crohn's disease. Both patients had underlying comorbidities and immunosuppression, but differed in presentation, radiological findings and recovery. This case series aims to remind readers of the broad differential of pathogens that can lead to disease in the immunocompromised and that one should not dismiss atypical cultured bacteria as commensal too hastily."
