TITLE:Vibrio vulnificus infection in Taiwan: report of 28 cases and review of clinical manifestations and treatment.
ABSTRACT:From May 1985 through July 1990, 28 episodes of Vibrio vulnificus infection in 27 patients were encountered in five major hospitals in Taiwan. The ages of patients ranged from 19 to 76 years; the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. Eighteen episodes manifested as bacteremia and eight as wound infections alone. One patient each developed gastroenteritis and pneumonia after nearly drowning. Twenty-three patients exhibited skin manifestations. Twenty patients had underlying diseases. All patients were treated with antibiotics, and 14 also underwent some form of surgical treatment (incision and drainage, fasciotomy, debridement, or amputation). Thirteen of the 28 episodes were preceded by precipitating factors; most were due to ingestion of seafood or exposure of abraded skin to salt water. Ten of the 18 septicemic patients died--most within 48 hours of hospitalization. One patient without bacteremia who had a wound infection died. Results of in vitro susceptibility studies suggested that ampicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin would be effective. Susceptibility to aminoglycosides was observed for greater than 90% of isolates. We recommend combined therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside along with appropriate surgical therapy for the treatment of V. vulnificus infection."

TITLE:Pulmonary infiltrates associated with Vibrio vulnificus septicemia.
ABSTRACT:In the case described, fatal Vibrio vulnificus primary septicemia was complicated by development of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Clinical features of this recently discovered infectious disease are discussed. Various aspects of diagnoses of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with V vulnificus septicemia are also presented. Vibriosis should be suspected in patients with chronic, underlying, predisposing diseases, recent ingestion of raw seafood, and characteristic skin lesions."

TITLE:Leptospirotic etiology in pulmonary and upper respiratory tract pathology.
ABSTRACT:A number of 3,200 febrile patients who presented upon admission to hospital primary pulmonary or upper respiratory tract impairment either as single forms of manifestation or associated to other syndromes were tested. The cases were screened by the rapid slide agglutination reaction with heat inactivated Patoc antigen and leptospirotic etiology was confirmed by the ultramicroscopic agglutination reaction with 18 live circulating pathogenic antigens. 64 leptospirosis cases with pulmonary impairment were confirmed and in 52 cases the upper respiratory tract was involved. Particular aspects of leptospirosis with pulmonary impairment: 71.8% of cases had a clinical diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia; 89% of cases presented important chest x-ray modifications; in an approximately equal number of cases the pulmonary involvement was the single manifestation or was associated with other syndromes; icterohaemorrhagiae, wolffi and pomona were the frequently encountered infecting serotypes. Particular aspects for leptospirosis involving the upper respiratory tract: 84.6% of cases had a clinical diagnosis of acute rhino-pharyngotracheitis; in 86.5% of cases the upper respiratory tract impairment was the single feature; the infecting serotypes were in decreasing order of frequency as follows: icterohaemorrhagiae, pomona, wolffi, canicola, grippotyphosa."

TITLE:Oral Campylobacter species involved in extraoral abscess: a report of three cases.
ABSTRACT:Oral Campylobacter species are rarely reported to cause extraoral infections. Here we present three cases of extraoral abscess caused by an oral Campylobacter sp. and a Streptococcus sp. The Campylobacter species were all isolated anaerobically and identified by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. The cases included a breast abscess caused by Campylobacter rectus and a non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in a patient with lymphoma, a liver abscess caused by Campylobacter curvus and an alpha-hemolytic streptococcus in a patient with complicated ovarian cancer, and a postobstructive bronchial abscess caused by C. curvus and group C beta-hemolytic Streptococcus constellatus in a patient with lung cancer. The abscesses were drained or resected, and the patients were treated with antibiotics with full resolution of the lesions. The C. curvus cases are likely the first reported infections by this organism, and the C. rectus case represents the second such reported extraoral infection."

TITLE:Demographic and clinical features of leptospirosis: three-year experience in central Taiwan.
ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leptospirosis is a major cause of fever in subtropical and tropical areas. The clinical manifestations are protean, ranging from very mild and nonspecific symptoms to severe septic shock and death. This retrospective study investigated the demographic and clinical features of leptospirosis in central Taiwan over 3 years, with emphasis on pulmonary manifestations. 
METHODS: We analyzed the clinical characteristics of serologically-confirmed leptospirosis cases at a tertiary teaching hospital from October 2002 to October 2005. 
RESULTS: Twenty three confirmed cases were included and Leptospira santarosai serovar Shermani was the most commonly identified serovar (77.3%). The male-to-female ratio was 2.67:1 and the average age was 42.4 years. Nineteen cases (82.6%) were hospitalized, 3 were diagnosed in the outpatient setting and 1 died before admission. The majority of cases (63.6%) occurred in rainy months (from June to October). Fever (incidence, 100%), anorexia (74%), headache (61%), gastrointestinal upset (53%), myalgia (48%), and cough (48%) were the common clinical manifestations. Fifteen cases (63%) had respiratory symptoms and twelve (52%) had chest roentgenography abnormalities. Multiple nodular densities pattern (42%) was the most common abnormal finding on chest plain film. Three patients met the criteria of Weil's syndrome. The overall mortality rate was 4.3%. 
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms or abnormal findings on chest X-ray were not uncommon in patients with leptospirosis. In addition to hepatic or renal dysfunction, leptospirosis should be seriously considered in patients with pulmonary symptoms and fever, especially in subtropical and tropical areas."

TITLE:Aseptic meningitis and adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by Borrelia persica.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of some of the clinical complications of tickborne relapsing fever  varies with Borrelia species. For example, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a newly reported complication, was described so far only with B. hermsii infection. MATERIALS AND 
METHODS: A previously healthy young Israeli man was admitted for fever and headache and was diagnosed as aseptic meningitis. Shortly before the lumbar puncture was performed he started to experience shortness of breath and developed acute respiratory insufficiency necessitating mechanical ventilation. Radiography, which was normal on admission, demonstrated bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Spirochetes suggestive of Borrelia were seen on a thick blood smear preparation, and polymerase chain reaction was positive for B. persica. 
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of ARDS in association  with Borrelia spp. occurring outside the  U.S.A. and the first one due to B. persica infection."

TITLE:[Three Cases of Bacteremia due to Helicobacter cinaedi Infection and the Usefulness of Gene Analysis of Isolated Bacteria].
ABSTRACT:Helicobacter cinaedi is typically isolated from immunocompromised patients. Some reports of infection caused by H.cinaedi have been found in recent years. We experienced three cases of H.cinaedi bacteremia in one year and ten months in our hospital, although the detection of H.cinaedi in blood cultures is extremely rare. In case 1, a 77-year-old female had been treated with a steroid and immunosuppressive agent for interstitial pneumonia. In cases 2 and 3, two 71-year-old men had been treated with chemotherapy for lung cancer. Although the identification of the bacteria could not be performed by the culture method in the three cases, H.cinaedi bacteremia was diagnosed by a 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis in case 1, and by nested PCR in cases 2 and 3. H.cinaedi bacteremia often tends to recur and also requires prolonged antimicrobial therapy. We believe that gene analysis is useful in the identification of H.cinaedi. "

ABSTRACT:We report a case of thoracic empyema caused by Campylobacter rectus, an organism considered as a periodontal pathogen but rarely recovered from extraoral specimens. The patient fully recovered through drainage of purulent pleural fluid and administration of antibiotics. The present case illustrates that C. rectus can be a cause of not only periodontal disease but also pulmonary infection."

TITLE:Mortality from selected diseases that can be transmitted by water - United States, 2003-2009.
ABSTRACT:Diseases spread by water are caused by fecal-oral, contact, inhalation, or other routes, resulting in illnesses affecting multiple body systems. We selected 13 pathogens or syndromes implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks or other well-documented waterborne transmission (acute otitis externa, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), free-living ameba, Giardia, Hepatitis A virus, Legionella (Legionnaires' disease), nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Pseudomonas-related pneumonia or septicemia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio). We documented annual numbers of deaths in the United States associated with these infections using a combination of death certificate data, nationally representative hospital discharge data, and disease-specific surveillance systems (2003-2009). We documented 6,939 annual total deaths associated with the 13 infections; of these, 493 (7%) were caused by seven pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A total of 6,301 deaths (91%) were associated with infections from Pseudomonas, NTM, and Legionella, environmental pathogens that grow in water system biofilms. Biofilm-associated pathogens can cause illness following inhalation of aerosols or contact with contaminated water. These findings suggest that most mortality from these 13 selected infections in the United States does not result from classical fecal-oral transmission but rather from other transmission routes."

TITLE:Factors associated with severity and mortality in patients with confirmed leptospirosis at a regional hospital in northern Taiwan.
ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory factors associated with disease severity and mortality from confirmed leptospirosis patients in Taiwan are not well known. This retrospective study examined patients with suspected leptospirosis admitted to En-Chu-Kong Hospital, a regional teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. 
METHODS: From January 2002 to July 2014, 733 suspected cases were reported to the National Reference Laboratory, 57 of which were identified as laboratory and clinical confirmed. We analyzed the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory factors associated with disease severity and mortality in 57 cases. 
RESULTS: The mean age was 59.1 +- 18.2 years, 74% were male, and 49% had occupational contact with soil. The major complications were pulmonary involvement (54%), shock (44%), ventilator support (32%), jaundice (32%), hemorrhage (30%), acute kidney injury (30%), meningitis (11%) and myocarditis (2%). Leptospira santarosai serova Shermani was present in 42 (74%) patients and 37 (58%) patients had severe leptospirosis. Sixteen (28%) patients had concomitant infections, including nine patients with bloodstream infection. The only independent predictor for severe leptospirosis was shock (OR 14.8, 95% CI 2.97-73.59). Eleven patients died (19%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (6 patients) was present in 55% of the fatal cases. The factors independently related to mortality were prior steroid use (OR 20.2, 95% CI 1.9-217.5) and hemorrhage (OR 71.2, 95% CI 4.9 - &gt;999.9). 
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that shock is a predictor of severe leptospirosis, and prior steroid use and hemorrhage are predictors of death from leptospirosis."

TITLE:Clival Osteomyelitis with Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Due to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus Induced by Tooth Extraction.
ABSTRACT:A 70-year-old woman who had suffered from aseptic meningitis complained of chronic headache after dental treatment including tooth extraction. She developed a fever and respiratory failure. Based on chest computed tomography and head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis in the clivus accompanying moderate pituitary involvement, cavernous sinus thrombosis and septic pulmonary embolism. Both of the causal bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus, were isolated from her blood. Dual infection leading to clival osteomyelitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis has not been reported. It is important to perform enhanced MRI and blood culture for patients with chronic headache related to dental treatment."

TITLE:Pulmonary Campylobacter concisus infection in an immunocompromised patient with underlying mucormycosis.
ABSTRACT:Campylobacter concisus is a rarely encountered agent of human infection. The first isolation of C. concisus from a pulmonary abscess in an immunocompromised patient who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation is reported here. This unusual case demonstrates the pathogenic potential of this bacterium and outlines species-immanent difficulties in gaining a reliable diagnosis. Molecular methods were a cornerstone for definite identification of the organism grown on anaerobic culture from surgically excised tissue. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed unusual quinolone and macrolide resistance, and therefore antimicrobial therapy was based on beta-lactam antibiotics."

TITLE:Herbaspirillum Infection in Humans: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
ABSTRACT:Introduction. Herbaspirillum seropedicae are Gram-negative oxidase-positive nonfermenting rods of Betaproteobacteria class, commonly found in rhizosphere. More recently, some Herbaspirillium species have transitioned from environment to human hosts, mostly as opportunistic (pathogenic) bacteria. We present a 58-year-old female with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with pneumonia and was found to have Herbaspirillum seropedicae bacteremia. Case History. A 58-year-old woman with NSCLC on Pralsetinib presented with fevers and rigors for 2 days. Coarse breath sounds were auscultated on the right upper lung field. Labs revealed leukopenia and mild neutropenia. CT chest revealed right upper lobe pneumonia. She was admitted for sepsis secondary to pneumonia and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. The patient continued to have fever 2 days after admission (max: 102.8 F). Preliminary blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods. The patient continued to have temperature spikes on the 3rd day of antibiotics (T max 101.5 F). Blood cultures revealed oxidase-positive nonfermenting rods. The patient's antibiotic was changed to IV meropenem on the 4th day of hospitalization. Ultimately, on the seventh day of hospitalization, the blood culture was confirmed from outside lab as Herbaspirillum seropedicae. The patient started feeling better and defervesced after about 24 hours. Discussion. More recently, Herbaspirillum spp. have been recovered from humans. Our patient had Herbaspirillum bacteremia, and reported regularly cleaning her pond and weeding her garden with possible exposure to this environmental proteobacterium. Herbaspirillum may be more prevalent than earlier thought owing to misidentification. With the institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the outcomes seem mostly favorable."

TITLE:Borrelia miyamotoi: 43 Cases Diagnosed in France by Real-Time PCR in Patients With Persistent Polymorphic Signs and Symptoms.
ABSTRACT:Background: Borrelia species are divided into three groups depending on the induced disease and the tick vector. Borrelia miyamotoi is a relapsing fever Borrelia but can induce symptoms related to Lyme disease. Discovered in 1995, it is found in ticks around the world. In France, this species of Borrelia has been isolated in ticks and rodents, but was not yet observed in humans. Objective: The aim of the study was to look for B. miyamotoi in symptomatic patients. Methods: Real-time PCR was performed on 824 blood samples from patients presenting symptoms of persistent polymorphic syndrome possibly due to tick bite, a syndrome recognized by the French Authority for Health, which is close to the post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. PCR was also performed on 24 healthy control persons. The primers were specifically designed for this particular species of Borrelia. The sequence of interest of 94 bp is located on the glpQ gene. Sequencing of amplification products, randomly chosen, confirmed the amplification specificity. To better investigate cases, a clinical questionnaire was sent to the patients PCR-positive for B. miyamotoi and to their physician. Results: This search revealed a positive PCR for B. miyamotoi in the blood from 43 patients out of 824 (5.22%). PCR was negative in all control persons. A clinical chart was obtained from 31 of the 43 patients. A history of erythema migrans was reported in five of these 31 patients (16%). All patients complained about fatigue, joint pain and neuro-cognitive disorders. Some patients complained about respiratory problems (chest tightness and/or lack of air in 41.9%). Episodes of relapsing fever were reported by 11 of the 31 patients (35.5%). Chilliness, hot flushes and/or sweats were reported by around half of the patients. B. miyamotoi may not cross-react with B. burgdorferi serology. Conclusion: This study is the first to detect B. miyamotoi in human blood in France. This series of human B. miyamotoi infection is the largest in patients with long term persistent syndrome. Our data suggest that this infection may be persistent, even on the long term."

TITLE:First report of human Leptospira santarosai infection in French Guiana.
ABSTRACT:Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. In French Guiana, a French overseas department of South America, this bacterial infection is endemic with the increase of human cases since the last 5 years. Nevertheless, the epidemiological data on the circulating infecting strain remains scarce due to the lack of specific symptoms and the used diagnostic approaches. We report a severe case of leptospirosis in a 52-years-old male, working as a street cleaner, hospitalized at the Intensive Care Unit of city capital hospital of French Guiana because of hemodynamic, neurological, renal, and respiratory failure. At ICU admission, the patient was comatose, his temperature was 37.3 C, heart rate 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 84/45mmHg, and oxygen saturation 95% while under mechanical ventilation. Retrospective exploration using molecular and serological approaches from the samples allowed reporting an infection by Leptospira santarosai serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo. To our knowledge, this is the first human case infected with this species in French Guiana. Through these analyses, this report provides new epidemiological information about the Leptospira strains circulating in French Guiana. In particular, this emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis to characterize with more precision the circulating Leptospira strains in this department."
