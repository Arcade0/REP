TITLE:Rothia dentocariosa pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient.
ABSTRACT:An 84-year-old woman with acute myelocytic leukemia presented with fever and a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray. She failed to respond to initial broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and a transthoracic needle aspirate subsequently both grew Rothia dentocariosa, a gram-positive branching rod. The pneumonia resolved after prolonged treatment with Clindamycin. Rothia dentocariosa must be considered a cause of opportunistic pulmonary infection."

TITLE:Community-acquired pneumonia due to Staphylococcus cohnii in an HIV-infected patient: case report and review.
ABSTRACT:Coagulase-negative staphylococci recently have been implicated as a cause of serious infections in immunocompromised individuals. An unusual case of community-acquired pneumonia due to Staphylococcus cohnii in an HIV-infected drug user is described. Results of a study conducted to examine the prevalence of infection due to Staphylococcus cohnii strains and their antibiotic-sensitivity patterns show a low frequency but a high morbidity. These results and a brief review of the literature emphasize the importance of these organisms and other staphylococcal species as emerging opportunistic pathogens in patients with AIDS."

TITLE:[Diagnostic imaging and therapeutic implications in lung infections in patients with HIV-1 infection].
ABSTRACT:We studied retrospectively 132 episodes of infectious pneumonias in 89 patients examined from 1990 to 1995. Pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common cause of pneumonia (33 patients). The other causes were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Cytomegalovirus (4), Haemophilus influentiae (4), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), E. coli (2), Serratia marcescens (1). No etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. We stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Pneumocystis carinii, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influentiae (1). Since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in HIV+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. Moreover, Pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and PCP has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (CD3+CD4 &lt; 200/mcl; LDH &gt; 600 UI/dl; PO2 &lt; 70 mmHg) patterns, always related to the discovery of Pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. Thus, we decided to treat 15 patients with specific therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery. To conclude, in critical patients, invasive procedures should be performed only in the cases in which PCP is clinically improbable."

TITLE:Rothia dentocariosa: two new cases of pneumonia revealing lung cancer.
ABSTRACT:Pneumonia due to Rothia dentocariosa is extremely rare: only 1 case of pneumonia due to this pathogen has been reported in an immunocompromised patient with acute myelocytic leukemia. In this report, 2 new cases of Rothia dentocariosa pneumonia are described in 2 patients with lung cancer. This opportunistic pulmonary agent, belonging to the oro-pharyngeal flora, is also known to cause endocarditis in patients with underlying cardiac pathology."

TITLE:Nosocomial outbreak of Enteroccocus gallinarum: untaming of rare species of enterococci.
ABSTRACT:An unusual increase in infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus gallinarum (VREG) was identified in May 2004, in a Colombian tertiary care teaching hospital. A case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. All VREG isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of E. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of E. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. Eleven cases of VREG were identified between May through June 2004. VREG was isolated from blood (N=4), surgical secretions (N=4), paranasal sinus secretion (N=1), lung abscess (N=1) and urine (N=1). Infections with VREG were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. Logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for VREG infection. All isolates were identified as E. gallinarum, harboured the vanC1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by PFGE. Virulence-associated genes were not detected. This is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of VREG and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination."

TITLE:Antibiotic-resistant obligate anaerobes during exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients.
ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are thought to cause the majority of lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, other bacterial pathogens may contribute to the pathophysiology of lung disease. Here, obligate anaerobes were identified in a cross-sectional study, and cell numbers and antibiotic susceptibilities of facultative and obligate anaerobes from 114 sputum samples from nine children and 36 adults with CF were determined. Furthermore, in 12 CF patients, we investigated whether conventional intravenous antibiotic therapy, administered during acute exacerbations, would affect the numbers of obligate anaerobes. Fifteen genera of obligate anaerobes were identified in 91% of the CF patients. Cell numbers (mean: 2.2 x 10(7) +/- standard deviation 6.9 x 10(7) CFU/mL of sputum sample) were comparable to those of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Staphylococcus saccharolyticus and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were most prevalent. Infection with P. aeruginosa did not increase the likelihood that obligate anaerobes are present in sputum specimens. Single obligate anaerobic species persisted for up to 11 months in sputum plugs in vivo. Patients with and without obligate anaerobes in sputum specimens did not differ in lung function. Intravenous therapy directed against P. aeruginosa during acute exacerbations increased lung function, but did not reduce the numbers of obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobic species differed widely in their patterns of resistance against meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftazidime. In 58% of patients with acute exacerbations, obligate anaerobes were detected that were resistant to the antibiotics used for treatment. Antibiotic therapy, optimized to target anaerobes in addition to P. aeruginosa, may improve the management of CF lung disease."

ABSTRACT:Neutropenic patients are susceptible to infections with usually harmless microorganisms. We report two cases of severe pneumonia in hematological patients due to Kytococcus schroeteri, a saprophyte of the human skin. When blood cultures or respiratory specimens yield micrococcus-like colonies, Kytococcus species, which are often resistant to penicillin, should be considered and the antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly."

TITLE:[First case report of respiratory infection with Rothia aeria].
ABSTRACT:A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with dysbasia and forgetfulness. Her past history included uveitis at age 39. Medical examinations led to a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Although she was treated with prednisolone, her symptoms remained, so she received steroid pulse therapy twice, and administration of azathioprine. In early January 2007, a chest X-ray film showed nodules in the right upper lung that rapidly increased in size and number. A CT scan revealed multiple nodules including cavitary lesions in both lung fields. Examination of bronchial lavage fluid and a transbronchial lung biopsy showed a mycelium-like gram-negative filament. After the treatment with benzylpenicillin for 1 month, her laboratory data and radiological abnormalities markedly ima proved. However, switching to oral administration of amoxicillin caused the regrowth of the nodules. She was retreated with intravenous benzylpenicillin for 8 weeks, followed by oral administration of amoxicillin for 5 months, and her condition completely resolved. The causative organism was identified as Rothia aeria (described in 2004) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This is the first report of a case of pulmonary infection with this species."

ABSTRACT:Group D streptococci have rarely been associated with neonatal infections. We report a case of fulminant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by Streptococcus alactolyticus in a term neonate. Gram staining revealed gram-positive cocci and culture grew group D streptococci in samples taken from trachea, ear, and nasopharynx. Streptococcus alactolyticus was identified using automated microbial identification system (Vitek 2). Histopathology showed massive pulmonary inflammation with intra-alveolar granulocytosis and secondary pulmonary bleeding as etiology of fatal outcome. To our knowledge, this is first case presenting neonatal infection caused by Streptococcus alactolyticus."

ABSTRACT:Linezolid (LZD) is an important antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci. And until now, LZD resistance in clinical is still rare. Here we reported the first case of LZD resistance Staphylococcus capitis in Jiangsu, China. This strain was isolated from a 92-year old female who received long-term and repeatedly antibiotics treatment because of recurrent pulmonary infections in August 2012. Isolated from blood, the Staphylococcus capitis showed a resistance to LZD with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 64 microg/mL, and the followed gene detection showed that the isolates existed C2190T and C2561Y point mutations in the 23S rRNA. Moreover, the isolation was also found carrying the cfr gene. "

TITLE:Comparison of community-onset Staphylococcus argenteus and Staphylococcus aureus sepsis in Thailand: a prospective multicentre observational study.
ABSTRACT:Staphylococcus argenteus is a globally distributed cause of human infection, but diagnostic laboratories misidentify this as Staphylococcus aureus. We determined whether there is clinical utility in distinguishing between the two. A prospective cohort study of community-onset invasive staphylococcal sepsis was conducted in adults at four hospitals in northeast Thailand between 2010 and 2013. Of 311 patients analysed, 58 (19%) were infected with S. argenteus and 253 (81%) with S. aureus. Most S. argenteus (54/58) were multilocus sequence type 2250. Infection with S. argenteus was more common in males, but rates of bacteraemia and drainage procedures were similar in the two groups. S. argenteus precipitated significantly less respiratory failure than S. aureus (5.2% versus 20.2%, adjusted OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.74, p 0.015), with a similar but non-significant trend for shock (6.9% versus 12.3%, adjusted OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.15-1.44, p 0.18). This did not translate into a difference in death at 28 days (6.9% versus 8.7%, adjusted OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.24-2.65, p 0.72). S. argenteus was more susceptible to antimicrobial drugs compared with S. aureus, and contained fewer toxin genes although pvl was detected in 16% (9/58). We conclude that clinical differences exist in association with sepsis due to S. argenteus versus S. aureus. "

TITLE:An unusual case of thoracic empyema caused by Granulicatella elegans (nutritionally variant streptococci) in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus infection.
ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) are an infrequent cause of human infection with Granulicatella elegans being the least encountered species in clinical specimens. The most common infection caused by NVS is infective endocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual case of thoracic empyema due to G. elegans in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus infection. The patient responded favourably to drainage and penicillin. 
CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that even though TB is responsible for the majority of pleural effusions in this setting, other rare opportunistic bacteria may cause infection in susceptible patients. Therefore, microbiological investigations should be performed in all patients presenting with pleural effusion."

TITLE:[A rarely isolated bacterium in microbiology laboratories: Streptococcus uberis].
ABSTRACT:Streptococcus uberis is a gram-positive bacterium that is mostly responsible for mastitis in cattle. The bacterium rarely has been associated with human infections. Conventional phenotyphic methods can be inadequate for the identification of S.uberis; and in microbiology laboratories S.uberis is confused with the other streptococci and enterococci isolates. Recently, molecular methods are recommended for the accurate identification of S.uberis isolates. The aim of this report is to present a lower respiratory tract infection case caused by S.uberis and the microbiological methods for identification of this bacterium. A 66-year-old male patient with squamous cell lung cancer who received radiotherapy was admitted in our hospital for the control. According to the chest X-Ray, patient was hospitalized with the prediagnosis of ''cavitary tumor, pulmonary abscess''. In the first day of the hospitalization, blood and sputum cultures were drawn. Blood culture was negative, however, Candida albicans was isolated in the sputum culture and it was estimated to be due to oral lesions. After two weeks from the hospitalization, sputum sample was taken from the patient since he had abnormal respiratory sounds and cough complaint. In the Gram stained smear of the sputum there were abundant leucocytes and gram-positive cocci, and S.uberis was isolated in both 5% sheep blood and chocolate agar media. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by VITEK 2 (Biomerieux, France) and also, the bacterium was identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) based VITEK MS system as S.uberis. The isolate was determined susceptible to ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, linezolid, penicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, tetracycline and vancomycin. 16S, 23S ribosomal RNA and 16S-23S intergenic spacer gene regions were amplified with specific primers and partial DNA sequence analysis of 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were performed by 3500xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). According to the partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, bacterium was confirmed as S.uberis. This report makes a significant contribution to the number of case reports of human infections caused by S.uberis as the identification was performed by current microbiological methods in our case. In conclusion, S.uberis should be evaluated as an opportunistic pathogen among the immunosuppressed patients and in addition to phenotypic bacteriological methods, the other recent microbiological methods should also be utilized for the identification."

TITLE:Purpura fulminans with Lemierre's syndrome caused by Gemella bergeri and Eikenella corrodens: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Gemella bergeri is one of the nine species of the genus Gemella and is relatively difficult to identify. We herein describe the first case of septic shock due to a Gemella bergeri coinfection with Eikenella corrodens. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Asian man with a medical history of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease who was prescribed corticosteroids (prednisolone) presented to our hospital with dyspnea. On arrival, he was in shock, and a purpuric eruption was noted on both legs. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed fluid retention at the right maxillary sinus, left lung ground glass opacity, and bilateral lung irregular opacities without cavitation. Owing to suspected septic shock, fluid resuscitation and a high dose of vasopressors were started. In addition, meropenem, clindamycin, and vancomycin were administered. Repeat computed tomography confirmed left internal jugular and vertebral vein thrombosis. Following this, the patient was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome. Furthermore, he went into shock again on day 6 of hospitalization. Additional soft tissue infections were suspected; therefore, bilateral below the knee amputations were performed for source control. Cultures of the exudates from skin lesions and histopathological samples did not identify any pathogens, and histopathological findings showed arterial thrombosis; therefore it was concluded that the second time shock was associated with purpura fulminans. Following this, his general status improved. He was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation. The blood culture isolates were identified as Gemella bergeri and Eikenella corrodens. Gemella bergeri was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing later. The primary focus of the infection was thought to be in the right maxillary sinus, because the resolution of the fluid retention was confirmed by repeat computed tomography. 
CONCLUSIONS: Gemella bergeri can be the causative pathogen of septic shock. If this pathogen cannot be identified manually or through commercial phenotypic methods, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be considered."

TITLE:First reported human case of meningitis by Staphylococcus condimenti.
ABSTRACT:Staphylococcus condimenti (S. condimenti) is a coagulase-negative bacterium, generally regarded as not pathogenic. Indeed, S. condimenti owes its name to having been isolated from starter cultures of fermented sausage, as well as from fish and soy sauces. To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of human infection caused by this bacterium have been reported. Here, we present a case of meningitis by S. condimenti in a 65-year-old woman who was brought to hospital after having been found unconscious at home. At her arrival, she had a Glasgow coma scale = 3, fever, and hypoxic-normocapnic respiratory failure. Examination of her cerebrospinal fluid showed a slightly increased white blood cell count, normal glucose and protein concentrations. Paired cultures on blood and liquor samples yielded S. condimenti. Targeted antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone led to a complete recovery. This unique case expands our knowledge on S. condimenti as a pathogenic bacterium."

TITLE:Neonatal meningitis, endocarditis, and pneumonitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus: a case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pasteurianus is a rare cause of neonatal infection, with only 3 cases reported in the USA and 18 cases reported in other countries within the past decade. Neonatal S. pasteurianus infection typically presents as meningitis. This case report describes the first neonatal case of S. pasteurianus endocarditis in the literature, in addition to a neonatal case of S. pasteurianus infection presenting as pneumonitis without meningitis. The S. pasteurianus infections in these two cases are unusual not only because of how rare this particular pathogen is, but also because of the atypical clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient is a full-term male infant admitted to NICU at 20 h of life due to respiratory distress. He was empirically started on ampicillin and gentamicin for presumed sepsis. Laboratory analysis of cerebral spinal fluid obtained after initiation of antibiotics was suggestive of partially treated meningitis. Blood cultures came back positive for S. pasteurianus. The neonate was transitioned from ampicillin to cefepime, while gentamicin was continued. Echocardiograph showed a possible tricuspid valve vegetation concerning for endocarditis. Due to the unusual complication of endocarditis, the patient remained on IV cefepime for 28 days rather than the more conventional duration of 14-21 days reported in the literature. The baby clinically improved with no evidence of thrombi or vegetations on repeat cardiac echo. The second patient is a full-term male infant who required intubation at birth for respiratory distress. Chest X-ray findings were concerning for meconium aspiration with pneumonitis. The baby went into septic shock and was empirically started on ampicillin and gentamicin. Blood cultures came back positive for S. pasteurianus, while cerebral spinal fluid and urine cultures were negative. Ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued after 3 days and the baby was started on cefepime and clindamycin for a total 14-day course. The baby clinically recovered and was discharged from NICU without any sequelae. 
CONCLUSIONS: These two cases highlight the importance of recognizing S. pasteurianus as a potential cause of neonatal sepsis and the importance of recognizing endocarditis and pneumonitis as possible clinical manifestations of this infection."

TITLE:Retropharyngeal abscess presenting as acute airway obstruction in a 66-year-old woman: A case report.
ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Adult retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is extremely rare, and most cases reported in the literature were related to tuberculous infection. We present a case of RPA with acute airway obstruction as the main manifestation in a 66-year-old woman that was considered to be non-tubercular suppurative inflammation in the retropharyngeal space. CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman complaining of chills and fever was admitted to our hospital. She was initially diagnosed with an acute upper respiratory tract infection. She lost consciousness twice during hospitalization. She regained consciousness immediately upon emergency tracheal intubation. Acute upper airway obstruction was suspected as arterial blood gas analysis showed obvious acute retention of carbon dioxide before the second tracheal intubation. The diagnosis of RPA was confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Kocuria kristinae was isolated from blood samples taken from both hands. The patient recovered and was subsequently discharged after receiving antibiotic therapy together with surgical incision and drainage of the abscess. 
CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of RPA in patients with acute airway obstruction. Surgical incision and drainage is an effective treatment for RPA."

TITLE:Half of 'Micrococcus spp.' cases identified by conventional methods are revealed as other life-threatening bacteria with different drug susceptibility patterns by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
ABSTRACT:Bacterial infection during chemotherapy is a fatal complication, therefore precise identification of the pathogenic microorganism is required for treatment. We report that 2 of 4 pediatric patients with malignancy who were diagnosed with Micrococcus spp. infection by conventional methods were finally revealed to have Kytococcus schroeteri and Kocuria marina infection by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis (16S rRNA analysis). Although K. schroeteri is morphologically similar to Micrococcus spp., its drug susceptibility profile is quite different from that of Micrococcus spp. K. schroeteri is resistant to penicillin and cephalosporin, which are effective for Micrococcus spp. In fact, penicillin-resistant lethal pneumonia caused by K. schroeteri has been reported in compromised hosts. Based on our results, Micrococcus spp. determined by conventional methods could contain other life-threatening bacteria with different drug susceptibility patterns from Micrococcus spp. To develop an effective empirical treatment for immunocompromised hosts, accumulation of pathogen data by 16S rRNA analysis is required."
