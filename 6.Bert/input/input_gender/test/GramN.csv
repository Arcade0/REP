The authors sought to determine the incidence and characteristics of bloodstream infections caused by these organisms in patients with underlying malignancies. METHODS: All consecutive episodes of hematogenous Achromobacter and Alcaligenes infections recorded from December 26, 1989, to July 27, 2003, were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Fifty-two episodes occurred in 46 patients; 31 patients (67%) had hematologic malignancies, and 24 (52%) experienced neutropenia (&lt; 500 cells/microL). Diabetes mellitus was present in 12 patients (26%), and high-dose corticosteroids were administered to 12 patients (26%). Seventeen of the 52 infectious episodes (33%) were nosocomial in origin, and 10 patients (22%) had sepsis syndrome. Achromobacter xylosoxidans was the most common cause of infection (47 of 52 episodes [94%]), followed by Ach. denitrificans (2 of 52 episodes [4%]) and Alcaligenes faecalis (1 of 52 episodes [2%]). Twenty-seven episodes (52%) were polymicrobial, and 3 patients (7%) had concurrent fungemia. Infected intravascular catheters were present in 13 of 52 cases (25%), pneumonia was encountered in 6 of 52 cases (12%), and urinary tract infections were present in 5 of 52 cases (10%). Most isolates exhibited in vitro susceptibility to carbapenems, antipseudomonal penicillins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, aminoglycosides, and monobactam was common. Seven deaths (15%) were attributable to Achromobacter species. Incidence rates for sepsis syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score &gt; 16), and use of mechanical ventilation and pressor support were significantly higher in patients who died (P &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that sepsis syndrome and high APACHE II scores were predictors of increased 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Most infections caused by this group of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria were attributable to Ach. xylosoxidans, and only one-third were acquired during hospitalization. The presence of sepsis syndrome has evolved as an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with high-risk malignancies accompanied by Achromobacter bloodstream infections."

Antibacterial therapies to treat pulmonary exacerbations are instituted empirically and are individualized based on both patient factors (severity of exacerbation, frequency of exacerbation, recent courses of anti-infectives) and pathogen factors (previously isolated pathogens and in vitro predicted susceptibilities). However, the epidemiology of pathogens infecting CF airways is changing, with increased incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative non-fermenters such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Accordingly, a great need for new and novel agents for the management of acute exacerbations in CF exists. While several antibiotics have recently been approved or are close to approval for clinical use, frequently their emphasis has been for Gram-positive, and specifically MRSA-related, disease. Despite this, these agents may have a role in CF-related exacerbations. This article reviews the spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics and clinical and theoretical evidence for the use of newer agents including tigecycline, doripenem and ceftobiprole in the management of CF pulmonary exacerbations. Appropriate use of these agents in CF will require detailed CF-specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data."

Recent studies proposed Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme and a species-level identification method by nrdA sequencing for this genus. Epidemiological data are needed to assess the species and/or the sequence types (STs) involved and their potential role in CF patients lung function degradation. The aims of this study were i) to describe the distribution of the different species of Achromobacter in our CF centre ii) to detect potential STs more involved in chronic colonisations iii) to detect a potential local or worldwide predominance of some STs among clinical and environmental isolates. METHODS: All the isolates (477) collected in our CF centre from 2007 to 2014 among the 177 patients attending the centre were identified using nrdA sequencing. MLST analysis was performed for 37 clinical and 14 environmental isolates. RESULTS: A total of 47 out of 177 patients presented positive culture(s) with Achromobacter spp., representing 12.7% of the patients of the centre each year. Eleven species were detected, A. xylosoxidans being the most prevalent species (27 patients). Only A. xylosoxidans (&gt;80%) and A. insuavis were involved in chronic colonisation (6.7%). MLST analysis revealed a wide diversity among the isolates (36 STs for 51 isolates). Nevertheless, one third of the isolates belonged to STs previously detected in clinical isolates from other countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first approach in understanding the global epidemiology of Achromobacter species in CF. These results confirm the high prevalence of the species A. xylosoxidans among CF patients, reveal the worldwide distribution of some STs and point out the potential role of environmental sources of contamination. More studies are needed to search for relationships between species and/or ST and pathogenicity."

This retrospective, case-control study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of A. xylosoxidans colonization/infection in cystic fibrosis patients. Individuals who were chronically colonized/infected (n=10), intermittently colonized/infected (n=15), and never colonized/infected with A. xylosoxidans (n=18) were retrospectively evaluated during two periods that were 2 years apart. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, lung function, and chronic bacterial co-colonization data were evaluated. Of the total study population, 87% were pediatric patients and 65.1% were female. Individuals chronically colonized/infected with A. xylosoxidans had decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (51.7% in the chronic colonization/infection group vs 82.7% in the intermittent colonization/infection group vs 76% in the never colonized/infected group). Compared with the other two groups, the rate of co-colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was higher in individuals chronically colonized/infected with A. xylosoxidans (P=0.002). Changes in lung function over 2 years in the three groups were not significant, although a trend toward a greater decrease in lung function was observed in the chronically colonized/infected group. Compared with the other two groups, there was a greater number of annual hospitalizations in patients chronically colonized/infected with A. xylosoxidans (P=0.033). In cystic fibrosis patients, there was an increased frequency of A. xylosoxidans colonization/infection in children, and lung function was reduced in patients who were chronically colonized/infected with A. xylosoxidans. Additionally, there were no differences in clinical outcomes during the 2-year period, except for an increased number of hospitalizations in patients with A. xylosoxidans. "

METHODOLOGY: HAP due to Achromobacter xylosoxidans identified at the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing from January 2008 to October 2011 was studied. Detailed clinical manifestations were collected. To study the clinical risk factors for the imipenem-resistant strain, patients were divided into two groups: imipenem-resistant (21 cases) and imipenem-nonresistant (20 cases). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used. RESULTS: All patients were &gt; 75 years of age, and 92.7% (38/41) were male. Nine patients died 30 days after infection. The mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) were 23.66 +- 7.71 and 6.93 +- 2.47, respectively. Almost all strains were resistant to aminoglycosides. However, the strains showed significant sensitivity to minocycline (MIN), piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ), and cefoperazone-sulbactam (SCF). Compared with the imipenem-nonresistant group, more patients with imipenem-resistant infection had the following characteristics: use of an intubation, use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CHD). Among the four risk factors, COPD and CHD remained independent risk factors in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HAP due to Achromobacter xylosoxidans occurred in severely ill elderly patients with a long-term indwelling catheter and many underlying diseases. Effective treatment of imipenem-resistant organisms is challenging. SCF, PTZ, and MIN may be useful for imipenem-resistant Achromobacter xylosoxidans."

","SPECIES:Achromobacter denitrificansID:32871970TITLE:Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced hyponatremia in an elderly lady with Achromobacter xylosoxidans pneumonia: Case report and insights into mechanism.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: Hyponatremia occurs frequently in the hospital setting and may be attributable to a host of etiologies. Drugs are frequently implicated. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) represents a well-recognized pharmacologic precipitant of drug-induced hyponatremia, with several reports extant in the retrievable literature. Nephrologists thus debate the mechanisms giving rise to TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia and the precise mechanism by which treatment with TMP/SMX generates reductions of serum sodium concentration remain controversial. The agent has a well-known effect of antagonizing the effects of aldosterone upon the distal nephron. Renal salt wasting and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion represent implicated mechanistic intermediaries in TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient endorsed no explicit concerns. DIAGNOSES: We describe the case of an 83-year-old female clinically diagnosed with pneumonia found to have an initial serum sodium in the range of 130 to 134 mEq/L consistent with mild hyponatremia upon admission. Sputum cultures grew Achromobacter xylosoxidans susceptible to TMP/SMX. The patient's serum sodium concentration precipitously decline following institution of treatment with TMP/SMX to 112 to 114 mEq/L during the course of 5 days. INTERVENTIONS: Severe hyponatremia proved recalcitrant to initial therapy with supplemental salt tabs and standard doses of the vasopressin receptor antagonist tolvaptan. OUTCOMES: Escalating doses of tolvaptan increased the patient's sodium to 120 to 124 mEq/L. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further management. During her stay, the patient did not exhibit frank or obvious clinical features consistent with hyponatremia nor readily appreciable evidence of volume depletion. LESSONS: TMP/SMX represents a frequent, though underreported cause of hyponatremia in the hospital setting several authors believe natriuresis may represent the most common mechanism underlying TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia. Evidence implicating natriuresis to be mechanistic in TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia include clinically appreciable hypovolemia and resolution of hyponatremia with oral or intravenous salt repletion. Salt repletion failed to monotherapeutically enhance our patient's hyponatremiadisfavoring renal salt wasting as originately mechanistic. Contemporaneous refractoriness of serum sodium to fluid restriction nor standard doses of tolvaptan confounded our initial attempts to mechanistically attribute the patient's hyponatremia to a specific cause. Clinical euvolemia and rapid response of hyponatremia to exceptionally high doses of tolvaptan strongly favors syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone to represent the chief mechanism by which TMP/SMX exacerbates hyponatremia."

RESULTS: The culture supernatants of all A. xylosoxidans produced a heat stable, active cytotoxin in NCI-H292 cells capable of leading to intracellular vacuoles and subsequent cell contact loss, chromatin condensation, a picnotic nucleus and cell death. There was a higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in the NCI-H292 cells after 24 h of incubation, with the fraction greater than 50 kDa from the culture supernatant. The cytotoxin activity remained even after treatment with polymyxin B, which suggested that the release of IL-6 and IL-8 was not stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic factor produced by A. xylosoxidans may represent an important virulence factor, which when associated with CF chronic lung inflammation, may cause tissue damage and decline of lung function."

Some members of this genus, such as xylosoxidans, cause primarily nosocomially acquired infections affecting multiple organ systems, including the respiratory tract, urinary tract, and, less commonly, the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Despite an increasing number of published case reports and literature reviews suggesting a global increase in achromobacterial disease, most clinicians remain uncertain of the organism's significance when clinically isolated. Moreover, effective treatment can be challenging due to the organism's inherent and acquired multidrug resistance patterns. We reviewed all published cases to date of non-cystic fibrosis achromobacterial lung infections to better understand the organism's pathogenic potential and drug susceptibilities. We found that the majority of these cases were community acquired, typically presenting as pneumonias (88%), and were most frequent in individuals with hematologic and solid organ malignancies. Our findings also suggest that achromobacterial lung infections are difficult to treat, but respond well to extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, such as ticarcillin, piperacillin, and cefoperazone.

METHODOLOGY: HAP due to Achromobacter xylosoxidans identified at the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing from January 2008 to October 2011 was studied. Detailed clinical manifestations were collected. To study the clinical risk factors for the imipenem-resistant strain, patients were divided into two groups: imipenem-resistant (21 cases) and imipenem-nonresistant (20 cases). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used. RESULTS: All patients were &gt; 75 years of age, and 92.7% (38/41) were male. Nine patients died 30 days after infection. The mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) were 23.66 +- 7.71 and 6.93 +- 2.47, respectively. Almost all strains were resistant to aminoglycosides. However, the strains showed significant sensitivity to minocycline (MIN), piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ), and cefoperazone-sulbactam (SCF). Compared with the imipenem-nonresistant group, more patients with imipenem-resistant infection had the following characteristics: use of an intubation, use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CHD). Among the four risk factors, COPD and CHD remained independent risk factors in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HAP due to Achromobacter xylosoxidans occurred in severely ill elderly patients with a long-term indwelling catheter and many underlying diseases. Effective treatment of imipenem-resistant organisms is challenging. SCF, PTZ, and MIN may be useful for imipenem-resistant Achromobacter xylosoxidans."

Most of them are identified as opportunistic, nosocomial pathogens in patients. Uncommon species are identified accurately, mainly due to the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical microbiology practice. Most of these uncommon non-fermenting rods are isolated from lower respiratory tract samples. Their significance in lower respiratory tract infections, such as rules of their testing are not clarified yet. AIM: The aim of this study was to review the clinical microbiological features of these bacteria, especially their roles in lower respiratory tract infections and antibiotic treatment options. METHOD: Lower respiratory tract samples of 3589 patients collected in a four-year period (2013-2016) were analyzed retrospectively at Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). Identification of bacteria was performed by MALDI-TOF MS, the antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was revealed to be the second, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii the third most common non-fermenting rod in lower respiratory tract samples, behind the most common Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total number of uncommon non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates was 742. Twenty-three percent of isolates were Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Beside Chryseobacterium, Rhizobium, Delftia, Elizabethkingia, Ralstonia and Ochrobactrum species, and few other uncommon species were identified among our isolates. The accurate identification of this species is obligatory, while most of them show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides. Resistance to ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems was frequently observed also. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found to be the most effective antibiotic agents. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(1): 23-30."

However, for unclear reasons some patients are never colonized by P. aeruginosa. The objectives of this study were to better define the clinical, genetic, and microbiological characteristics of such a subpopulation and to identify predictive factors of non-colonization with P. aeruginosa. The French CF patient registry 2013-2014 was used to identify CF patients aged &gt;= 20 years. The clinical outcomes, CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) genotypes, and microbiological data of patients reported positive at least once for P. aeruginosa (""Pyo"" group, n = 1,827) were compared to those of patients with no history of P. aeruginosa isolation (""Never"" group, n = 303). Predictive factors of non-colonization by P. aeruginosa were identified by multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection. Absence of aspergillosis (odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] = 1.64 [1.01-2.66]), absence of diabetes (2.25 [1.21-4.18]), pancreatic sufficiency (1.81 [1.30-2.52]), forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) &gt;= 80% (3.03 [2.28-4.03]), older age at CF diagnosis (1.03 [1.02-1.04]), and absence of F508del/F508del genotype (2.17 [1.48-3.19]) were predictive clinical factors associated with absence of infection (""Never"" group). Microbiologically, this same group was associated with more frequent detection of Haemophilus influenzae and lower rates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Aspergillus spp. (all p&lt;0.01) in sputum. This study strongly suggests that the absence of pulmonary colonization by P. aeruginosa in a minority of CF adults (14.2%) is associated with a milder form of the disease. Recent progress in the development of drugs to correct CFTR deficiency thus may be decisive in the control of P. aeruginosa lung infection."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are considered as potential reservoirs in hospitals. We performed a retrospective study to estimate the frequencies of Achromobacter spp. HAI among patients from French West Indies, to determine characteristics of infected patients and establish a possible link between CF and infections. METHODS: All adults with at least one Achromobacter spp. positive sample and infection criteria in accordance with European official definitions of HAI, hospitalized in University Hospital of Martinique from 2006 to 2016 for more than 48 h, were included. Patient clinical features, immune status and underlying diseases were obtained from medical files. A list of CF patients was given by clinicians. Antibiotic-susceptibility profiles of the strains were determined using an automated method. RESULTS: Mean incidence density was 0.038/1000 days of hospitalization. Achromobacter spp. HAI evolved as an endemic situation with a low but pretty much stable incidence rate over the 11-year observation period. An epidemic peak was noticed in 2013. Among the 66 included patients, 56.1% were immunocompetent and no one had CF. Pneumonia and bacteraemia were the two main HAI. Among the 79 isolated strains, 92.4% were resistant to at least 1 major antibiotic and 16.4% met the definition of multidrug-resistant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This microorganism, little known in our country because of the scarcity of CF patients, represents a threat for both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients and a therapeutic challenge because of its high resistance."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of A. xylosoxidans isolation on respiratory function of adult patients with CF in the first 3 years after identification of A. xylosoxidans isolation. Methods: This was a case-control retrospective study performed at a single CF centre in Lille, France. Data for 36 patients with CF who had at least one sputum culture positive for A. xylosoxidans (Ax+) were evaluated and compared with control CF patients uninfected by A. xylosoxidans (Ax-). Respiratory function and exacerbation frequency were evaluated between 1 year prior to and 3 years after A. xylosoxidans isolation. Results: Compared with the Ax- group, the Ax+ group had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at baseline (median (interquartile range): 55.2% (50.6-59.8%) versus 73.8% (67.2-80.4%); p=0.005), a greater decline in FEV1 (+-se) in the first year after A. xylosoxidans identification (-153.6+-16.1 mL year-1 versus -63.8+-18.5 mL year-1; p=0.0003), and more exacerbations in the first 3 years after A. xylosoxidans identification (9 (7-12) versus 7 (5-10); p=0.03). Ax+ patients co-colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=27, 75%) had a greater FEV1 decline (p=0.003) and more exacerbations in the year after A. xylosoxidans identification (p=0.037) compared with patients colonised with A. xylosoxidans alone. Patients with chronic A. xylosoxidans isolation (n=23, 64%) had more exacerbations than intermittently colonised patients in the 3 years after A. xylosoxidans identification (p=0.012).

However, other opportunistic bacterial pathogens like Achromobacter xylosoxidans complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and non-tuberculous mycobacteria are currently emerging in CF and are also reported in non-CF bronchiectasis. BACKGROUND: The emergence of opportunistic bacterial pathogens has been recognized in CF through annual national reports of sputum microbiology data. Despite common factors driving the emergence of bacteria identified in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients, bronchiectasis registries have been created more recently and no longitudinal analysis of recorded microbiological data is currently available in the literature, thereby preventing the recognition of emerging bacteria in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. OUTLOOK: A longitudinal follow-up of microbiological data is still needed in non-CF bronchiectasis to identify emerging opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Homogeneity in practice of sputum microbiological examination is also required to allow comparative analysis of data in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pathogens recognized as emerging in CF have to be more carefully monitored in non-CF bronchiectasis in view of their association with deterioration of the lung disease."

Drugs are frequently implicated. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) represents a well-recognized pharmacologic precipitant of drug-induced hyponatremia, with several reports extant in the retrievable literature. Nephrologists thus debate the mechanisms giving rise to TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia and the precise mechanism by which treatment with TMP/SMX generates reductions of serum sodium concentration remain controversial. The agent has a well-known effect of antagonizing the effects of aldosterone upon the distal nephron. Renal salt wasting and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion represent implicated mechanistic intermediaries in TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient endorsed no explicit concerns. DIAGNOSES: We describe the case of an 83-year-old female clinically diagnosed with pneumonia found to have an initial serum sodium in the range of 130 to 134 mEq/L consistent with mild hyponatremia upon admission. Sputum cultures grew Achromobacter xylosoxidans susceptible to TMP/SMX. The patient's serum sodium concentration precipitously decline following institution of treatment with TMP/SMX to 112 to 114 mEq/L during the course of 5 days. INTERVENTIONS: Severe hyponatremia proved recalcitrant to initial therapy with supplemental salt tabs and standard doses of the vasopressin receptor antagonist tolvaptan. OUTCOMES: Escalating doses of tolvaptan increased the patient's sodium to 120 to 124 mEq/L. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further management. During her stay, the patient did not exhibit frank or obvious clinical features consistent with hyponatremia nor readily appreciable evidence of volume depletion. LESSONS: TMP/SMX represents a frequent, though underreported cause of hyponatremia in the hospital setting several authors believe natriuresis may represent the most common mechanism underlying TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia. Evidence implicating natriuresis to be mechanistic in TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia include clinically appreciable hypovolemia and resolution of hyponatremia with oral or intravenous salt repletion. Salt repletion failed to monotherapeutically enhance our patient's hyponatremiadisfavoring renal salt wasting as originately mechanistic. Contemporaneous refractoriness of serum sodium to fluid restriction nor standard doses of tolvaptan confounded our initial attempts to mechanistically attribute the patient's hyponatremia to a specific cause. Clinical euvolemia and rapid response of hyponatremia to exceptionally high doses of tolvaptan strongly favors syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone to represent the chief mechanism by which TMP/SMX exacerbates hyponatremia."

The case-fatality rate was 30%; only 3% of patients with primary or catheter-associated bacteremia died, but 65% of patients with meningitis, endocarditis, and pneumonia died. The case-fatality rate in neonates was 80%. Susceptibility studies showed that all strains were resistant to aminoglycosides, most were resistant to quinolones, and all were susceptible to broad-spectrum penicillins, imipenem, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Two-disk approximation and time-kill studies showed synergy or additive effects for the combination of gentamicin and piperacillin against most strains."

Description of 3 cases and review of the literature].ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Alcaligenes (Achromobacter) xylosoxidans occasionally cause infections, mainly in immunocompromised hosts. METHODS: Three cases of bacteremia due to A. xylosoxidans observed at the Fundacion Jimenez Diaz between 1985-1994 were described. Moreover, 38 single cases of bacteremia due to A. xylosoxidans and 21 episodes associated with outbreak were reviewed by using computerized bibliography data base MEDLINE (1970-december 1994). RESULTS: From 41 patients with bacteremia (including our 3 cases) reviewed, 27 were immunosuppressed hosts (twenty had neoplasia disease). The most common clinical presentation was primary bacteremia (11 cases, 27%) and pneumonia (10, 24%), followed by catheter-associated bacteremia (8, 20%), meningitis (4), bacteremia from abdominal cavity (4), endocarditis (3) and pyelonephritis (1). The mortality rate was higher (39%), specially in patients whom were a intensive care unit acquisition (87%), and illness with endocarditis (100%). No patient with catheter-related bacteremia died. All of 21 outbreak episodes of bacteremia had a autolimited form and low mortality (4.8%). CONCLUSION: A. xylosoxidans is a microorganism with demonstrated capacity of cause bacteremia, mainly in immunocompromised hosts, with high mortality rates. Sometimes, it causes outbreaks of bacteremia with low mortality."

Rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality, and resistance rates in the ICU can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. Objectives: To evaluate the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with pneumonia hospitalized in ICUs. Methods: A total of 6091 bacterial isolates were consecutively collected from 75 US medical centres in 2015-17 as part of the International Network for Optimal Resistance Monitoring (INFORM) programme and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. Results: The most common organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (30.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%), Klebsiella spp. (11.8%), Enterobacter spp. (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.1%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.1%). Colistin (99.8% susceptible), ceftazidime/avibactam (96.8% susceptible in 2015-17 and 96.2% in 2017) and ceftolozane/tazobactam (96.5% susceptible in 2017) were the most active compounds against P. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime/avibactam (100.0% susceptible), amikacin (99.4% susceptible) and meropenem (97.6% susceptible) were the most active compounds against Enterobacteriaceae. S. maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii exhibited high resistance rates to most antimicrobials tested. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 67.1% of the patients and P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae represented &gt;80% of these organisms. Ceftazidime/avibactam and amikacin provided the best coverage against Gram-negative organisms overall."

CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed with RA &gt;30 years previously. After inadequate treatment responses to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), she developed progressive RA, including swollen joints in both hands, and had a high disease activity score of 4.96 when presenting at our rheumatology clinic. She had started taking the TNFI, golimumab (50 mg/month), 3 years before and developed a productive cough 4 weeks before this admission. One week after admission, she developed fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and increased serum C-reactive protein level. DIAGNOSIS: Chest plain film (CxR) and computed tomography of the chest showed hospital-acquired pneumonia; microbial examination of the sputum showed the presence of MDRAB. THERAPEUTICS: She was prescribed a full course of antibiotics with cefoperazone sulbactam. OUTCOMES: CxR showed complete remission of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Biological DMARDs, such as TNFI, act as a double-edged sword: these drugs are used to treat autoimmune diseases, but they increase the risk of infection. The trend toward antibiotic resistance and persistent environmental survival of MDRAB is an emerging problem in countries with high rates of antibiotic abuse. TNFI may affect intestinal immunity by inducing dysbiosis, which affects T helper 17-mediated mucosal immunity and can contribute to A baumannii colonization and the development of MDRAB in frequently hospitalized patients."

RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple factors have been associated with infections because of MDR bacteria, including prolonged hospital stay, presence of invasive devices, mechanical ventilation, colonization with resistant pathogens, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Management of these infections includes the prompt use of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, implementation of antimicrobial stewardship protocols, and targeted active microbiology surveillance. Combination therapy and novel molecules have been used for the treatment of severe infections caused by resistant bacteria. SUMMARY: The exponential increase of antimicrobial resistance among virulent pathogens currently represents one of the main challenges for clinicians in the intensive care unit. Knowledge of the local epidemiology, patient risk stratification, and infection-control policies remain key elements for the management of MDR infections. Results from clinical trials on new molecules are largely awaited."

The efficacy about TGC has been recently reported. However, the adverse events (AEs) remain controversial. Our study aims to analyze the safety of the high-dose (HD) regimens in the treatment of VAP due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.The clinical data of 134 patients who were diagnosed with VAP from January 2013 to December 2015 in the NeuroScience Care Unit (NCU) were analyzed retrospectively. The incidence and the occurrence time of AEs, 28-day mortality, and the factors of clinical effectiveness were explored.A total of 54 patients received the standard dose group (SD), 69 in the HD, and 11 in the nonstandard HD group (NHD). Acinetobacter baumannii were the main pathogenic bacteria. There was no statistic difference in the incidence of AEs and the 28-day mortality among the 3 groups (P &gt; .05). Total bilirubin (TBIL) increased significantly after SD of TGC treatment (P = .004). Liver dysfunction occurred the latest (10.83 +- 7.08), not in the duration of HD group (9.63 +- 3.92), whereas in the SD group (13.00 +- 7.57) and NHD group (12.64 +- 3.70). Patients with septic shock, MODS, and higher APACHE II score were of high risk in mortality. The HD group was associated with higher clinical effective rate and bacteria clearance rate.HD TGC was relatively safe and tolerable in ICU patients. The risk of side effects was related to the TGC duration, although not increased as the dosage rose. Full course of the HD regimen was associated with better outcomes for the treatment of VAP patients, especially for the MDR gram-negative bacilli infection.

This study investigated the clinical efficacy between aerosolized colistimethate sodium (AS-CMS, 2 million units thrice a day) treatment alone or in combination with standard-dose tigecycline (TGC) in patients with non-bacteremic pneumonia due to XDR-Acb, and explored the factors influencing patients' 30-day mortality.A 1:1 case (n = 106; receiving TGC plus AS-CMS) control (receiving AS-CMS alone with matching scores) observational study was conducted among adult patients with non-bacteremic XDR-Acb complex pneumonia in a Taiwanese medical center from January 2014 through December 2016. The clinically relevant data were retrospectively recorded. The primary endpoint was 30-day case fatality. Secondary endpoints investigated that if the co-morbidities, XDR-A. baumannii as a pneumonic pathogen, therapy-related factors, or airway colonization with colistin-resistant Acb negatively influenced the 14-day clinical condition of enrolled patients.A higher 30-day mortality rate was noted among the group receiving combination therapy (34.0% vs 22.6%; P = .17). The &gt;=7-day AS-CMS therapy successfully eradicated &gt; 90% of airway XDR-Acb isolates. Nevertheless, follow-up sputum specimens from 10 (6.4% [10/156]) patients were colonized with colistin-resistant Acb isolates. After the conditional factors were adjusted by multivariate logistic analysis, the only factor independently predicting the 30-day case-fatality was the failure of treating XDR-Acb pneumonia at 14 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 38.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.96-142.29; P &lt; .001). Cox proportional regression analysis found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.05-4.10; P = .035), chronic renal failure (aHR = 3.00; 95% CI = 1.52-5.90; P = .002), non-invasive ventilation use (aHR = 2.68; 95% CI = 1.37-5.25; P = .004), and lack of TGC therapy (aHR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.27-1.00; P = .049) adversely influenced the 14-day clinical outcomes. Conversely, the emergence of colistin-resistant Acb isolates in the follow-up sputum samples was not statistically significantly associated with curing or improving XDR-Acb pneumonia.In conclusion, aggressive pulmonary hygiene care, the addition of TGC, and corticosteroid dose tapering were beneficial in improving the 14-day patients' outcomes."

Despite very limited antimicrobial options, clinicians have sought to reduce the mortality of patients with serious CRAB infections. To determine whether these long-term efforts effectively lessened the mortality of such patients, we investigated changes in the early mortality of adult patients with CRAB bacteremia and related clinical factors. METHODS: We reviewed clinical data from 111 adult patients with monomicrobial CRAB bacteremia admitted to an academic medical center between 2006 and 2016. RESULTS: The 14-day mortality rate from 2013 to 2016 was lower than that from 2009 to 2012 (43.4% vs. 71.1%, p = 0.01). When the clinical characteristics of adult patients with CRAB bacteremia from 2013 to 2016 were compared to those of the patients from 2009 to 2012, chronic lung disease (6.7% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.01), a recent history of mechanical ventilation (38.3% vs. 57.8%, p = 0.048), and pneumonia (48.3% vs. 68.9%, p = 0.04) were less frequent in 2013-2016, while neurological disease (43.3% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.02), central venous catheter infection (20.0% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.05), and early appropriate antimicrobial therapy (46.7% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.01) were more frequent. CONCLUSION: The 14-day mortality rate of adult patients with CRAB bacteremia was reduced during 2013-2016. This decrease was associated with early appropriate antimicrobial therapy and a lower proportion of patients with bacteremic pneumonia, which seemed to result from improved hospital infection control during that time period."

Still, few studies addressed the disease burdens and outcomes of AB infection in HIV patients. We aimed to describe characteristics and outcomes of AB infections in patients with HIV, measure the impact of AB infection on 28-day mortality in HIV patients, as well as assess the predictors of 28-day survival among HIV patients with AB pneumonia. A retrospective study with HIV/AB co-infected patients was conducted at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC), China. Patients with AB pneumonia were further analyzed for predictors of mortality, as well as an additional 1:1 case-control study to determine the fatality of AB pneumonia compared with pneumonia of other pathogens. We found the incidence of AB infection was 17.4 cases per 100 person-years among all hospitalized HIV patients. Hospital mortality rate was 37.5% (21/56). There was a higher 28-day mortality rate in HIV patients with pneumonia due to AB than other pathogens (34% vs 16%, P = 0.03). APACHE II score was independently associated with 28-day survival by multivariate logistic regression (P = 0.031). Our findings indicate that AB infection is incident and can be fatal in HIV seropositive population. AB infection is an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with HIV and pneumonia. A lower APACHE II score on admission predicts a higher 28-day survival rate among HIV/AB co-infected patients."

Herein, we investigate the incidence, mortality, bacteriology, and source of infection of recurrent bacteremia in military burn casualties admitted to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center over a 10year period. METHODS: Bacteremia was defined as the growth of Gram-positive or Gram-negative organisms in a blood culture that excluded probable skin contaminants. Recurrent bacteremia was defined as a subsequent episode of bacteremia &gt;=7 days after the first episode. Polymicrobial bacteremia was the presence of more than one pathogen in the same blood culture. Bacteremia was attributed to UTI, pneumonia, or wound sepsis. All other bacteremias were considered non-attributable bloodstream infections. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined factors predictive of clinical outcome. RESULTS: Out of 952 combat-related burn casualties screened, 166 cases were identified; 63% (non-recurrent) and 37% (recurrent) with median time to recurrence of 20 days. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the mortality rate was two and nine-fold, respectively, higher with recurrent bacteremia. Univariate analysis found that except for urinary tract infection, large burn size (&gt;20%), 3rd degree burns, increased injuiry severity, perineal burns, and mechanical ventilator days were independent factors predictive of recurrence of bacteremia as well as increased mortality in the recurrent bacteremia cohort. Acinetobacter baumannii complex (63%) was prevalent in the non-recurrent group, while Klebsiella pneumoniae (46% vs. 30%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35% vs. 26%) were prevalent in recurrent bacteremia. Half of the recurrent bacteremia cases were polymicrobial, compared to 9% in non-recurrent bacteremia. Pneumonia was prevalent in non-recurrent bacteremia (38%) and a combination of pneumonia and wound sepsis (29%) in recurrent bacteremia casualties. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent bacteremia increases mortality in military burn casualties. Additional research is needed to address and mitigate the underlying causes, thereby improving survival."

Patients with MV &gt; 48 h who developed a respiratory tract positive culture for Acinetobacter were included, and distinguished among colonized, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) patients. Primary outcome was ICU mortality. RESULTS: 153 patients were in MV and presented positive culture for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumanii complex, 70 of them with VAP, 59 with VAT and 24 patients were colonized. The factors related to ICU mortality were VAP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and shock at the time of diagnosis (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8-2.3). In multivariate analysis, only SOFA score at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was related with ICU mortality. A paired-matched analysis was performed to assess effect of dual therapy on outcomes, and no effect was found in terms of clinical cure, ICU or hospital mortality or duration of antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Previous comorbidities and degree of associated organic injury seem to be more important factors in the prognosis than double antibiotic therapy in patients with Acinetobacter-related respiratory infection."

Results: A total of 2492 patients received mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 hours and were enrolled in the study. A total of 129 (5.0%) patients fulfilled the VAP criteria, and 38 (29.5%) patients were diagnosed with early-onset VAP. The incidence of VAP was 4.5 per 1000 ventilation days, with a 28-day mortality rate of 45%. Individual pathogens, including 115 bacteria and 2 fungi, were identified in 117 (90.7%) enrollees, and 87 (75.7%) bacteria were multidrug-resistant organisms. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most commonly detected pathogens causing VAP. No difference in the distribution of pathogens was observed between early- and late-onset VAP or between surviving and non-surviving patients.

Gram-negative (G-) bacteria accounted for 86.11% (93/108). The isolation rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was the highest, reaching 31.48% (34/108); the isolation rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii were 22.22% (24/108), 8.33% (9/108) and 9.26% (10/108), respectively. Gram-positive (G+) bacteria accounted for 6.48% (7/108), of which Staphylococcus aureus was 4.63% (5/108); and fungi was 7.41% (8/108). Drug resistance analysis showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100% sensitive to amikacin (AMK), meropenem (MEM) and polymyxin (POL), and were suggested as the preferred drug. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% sensitive to AMK, tobramycin (TOB) and POL, but 100% resistant to compound trimethoprim (PCST).

Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to gentamicin (GEN), furantoin (NIT), rifampicin (RIF), vancomycin (VAN) and teicoplanin (TEC), while the drug resistance to clindamycin (CLI) and penicillin (PEN) was high (both 80.00%). Most pathogens were multidrug-resistant. The mortality of patients with multidrug resistant bacteria infection was significantly higher than that of non-multidrug resistant bacteria infection [51.85% (28/52) vs. 30.56% (11/36), chi 2 = 4.240, P = 0.046]. CONCLUSIONS: VAP was associated with brain injury and cerebrovascular accident, duration of mechanical ventilation &lt; 7 days, albumin &gt; 28 g/L and tracheotomy. VAP patients were infected mainly with G- bacteria and showed multiple drug resistance."

In particular, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has caused a severe challenge to human health. Here we reported the draft genome sequence of A. baumannii S131434, an OXA-23, OXA-66, ADC-25 and TEM-1D co-producing strain recovered from a patient with neonatal pneumonia in China and belonging to the globally disseminated sequence type 195 (ST195) of clonal complex 92 (CC92). METHODS: Genomic DNA was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq platform and the reads were de novo assembled into contigs using CLC Genomics Workbench. The assembled contigs were annotated and bioinformatics analysis was performed. RESULTS: The genome comprised a circular chromosome of 3898344bp. The presence of the blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66, blaADC-25 and blaTEM-1D genes was detected. In addition, genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracycline were also identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the isolate was resistant to all of the tested antibiotics except for polymyxin B, piperacillin/sulbactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical A. baumannii ST195 (CC92) isolate producing OXA-23, OXA-66, ADC-25 and TEM-1D in southern China. This draft genome will facilitate further our understanding of the antimicrobial resistance and pathogenic mechanisms in this strain and provides valuable information regarding the colonisation and adaptation of MDR pathogens."

The utility of the Etest was also assessed. METHODS: Nine subjects with pneumonia caused by CoRAB were enrolled from 20 July 2016 to 21 June 2018. Subjects were randomised to colistin/rifampicin combination therapy or colistin monotherapy. After exclusion of one patient who dropped out, the microbiological response (MR) and clinical response (CR) on Day 14 and mortality on Day 30 were assessed. Etest was conducted using CoRAB isolated at study enrolment. RESULTS: The MR rate in the colistin/rifampicin combination group (100.0%) was better than that in the colistin group (40.0%), however the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.196). The CR rate was not significantly different between the two groups. The MR (100.0%) and CR (100.0%) rates in subjects with 'partial synergy' as shown by Etest were higher than those (25.0% and 50.0%, respectively) in subjects with 'indifferent' results (i.e. no synergistic effect), however the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.143 and 0.429, respectively). Mortality occurred in two subjects with 'indifferent' results by Etest. CONCLUSIONS: Colistin/rifampicin combination therapy may have potential to achieve MR in pneumonia caused by CoRAB; however, achieving CR with this treatment is doubtful. 'Partial synergy' of colistin and rifampicin, as shown by Etest, may be a good prognostic factor [ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT03622918]."

To study the pathogenesis of A. baumannii and to develop new treatments, appropriate mouse models are needed. Most reported mouse models of pulmonary A. baumannii infection are non-lethal or require mouse immunosuppression to enhance infection. These models are not suitable for studying host immune responses or evaluating immunotherapies. METHODS: The virulence of 30 clinical isolates was assessed in mice. The most virulent isolate, SJZ24, was selected to develop a pneumonia model in immunocompetent mice. The cytokine mRNA expression in the lung was assessed with real-time PCR. The cell infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after SJZ24 infection was determined by flow cytometry. Vaccine efficacy was assessed using this model. RESULTS: Intratracheal inoculation of SJZ24 (5 x 107 CFU) resulted in death in 100% of the mice (5/5). SJZ24-infected mice showed high bacterial burdens in blood and organs as well as severe lung-tissue damage. Infection with SJZ24 induced increased inflammatory cytokine expression in the lung and increased neutrophil infiltration in BALF. Immunization with inactivated whole cells of SJZ24 showed 100% protection (5/5) against A. baumanni infection in this model. CONCLUSIONS: We established a lethal pneumonia model in immunocompetent mice with hypervirulent A. baumannii isolate SJZ24. This model can be used to study the immune response to A. baumannii infection and to evaluate vaccine efficacy."

Multidrug-resistant strains of causative VAP pathogens are becoming increasingly common. Aerosolized antibiotics achieve high alveolar concentrations and provide valuable adjuncts in the treatment of VAP. This study examined the impact of aerosolized antibiotics in the treatment of VAP in trauma patients. Patients with either Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP over 10 years treated with aerosolized antibiotics (cases) were stratified by age, severity of shock, and injury severity. A frequency-matched (by causative pathogen) control group treated without aerosolized antibiotics was used for comparison. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors for the use of aerosolized antibiotics. One hundred twenty VAP episodes were identified in 100 patients. Microbiologic resolution was achieved in all patients treated with aerosolized antibiotics. There was no difference in mortality (14.5% vs 15.7%, P = 0.87) and no antibiotic-related complications in either group. Multivariable logistic regression identified VAP persistence and relapse as independent predictors for the use of aerosolized antibiotics. Combined with systemic therapy, aerosolized antibiotics broaden the spectrum of therapy. They are valuable adjuncts with minimal risk of antibiotic resistance and/or systemic complications."

The spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology and the genetic support of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates collected from Saint-Georges Hospital in Lebanon. METHODS: Between January and August 2016, 31 A. baumannii isolates were collected from sputum samples of patients infected with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and treated with colistin-carbapenem combination therapy. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. Carbapenemases, extended spectrum beta-lactamases encoding genes and mcr-1/2 genes were investigated by RT-PCR and standard PCR. The epidemiological relatedness of the strains was studied using MLST analysis. RESULTS: Most of the isolates exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. All the isolates were carbapenem-resistant and among them, 30 carried the class D carbapenemase blaoxa-23 gene while one isolate carried blaoxa-72 gene. MLST results revealed three sequence types, namely ST2, ST699, and ST627. Isolates having ST2 were the most prevalent clone (29/31, 93.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a nosocomial spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii ST2 having blaOXA-23 gene in Saint-George in Lebanon. Monitoring and control measures need to be adopted to avoid the spread of A. baumannii to patients."

The major causes of pneumonia in neurologic patients may differ from those in the general population, resulting in a different pathogen distribution. We investigated the trends of pathogen distribution in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients and the related antibiotic resistance in those with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: A retrospective study was performed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea. Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology with a positive respiratory specimen culture between 2007 and 2016 were included. Pneumonia events in patients were screened by chronologically associating the date of respiratory specimen acquisition for culture studies and the date of antibiotics administration. Subgroup analyses regarding multidrug resistance in HAP were performed in different pneumonia categories, by presence of &gt;=1 risk factor and by time period (first half vs. second half of study period). Microbial resistance profiles of isolates from patients with pneumonia were analyzed. Results: We identified 351 pneumonia cases in 227 patients involving 36 different pathogens. 232 cases were HAP, of which 70 cases were intensive care unit (ICU)-HAP. The leading pathogens were Stapylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, which were isolated in 133 (37.9%), 72 (20.5%), 55 (15.7%), 44 (12.5%), 33 (9.4%), and 27 (7.7%) cases, respectively. Cases with HAP showed a higher proportion of P. aeruginosa and a lower proportion of S. pneumoniae (both, p &lt; 0.05) than those with non-HAP. ICU-HAP isolates showed a higher multidrug resistance (MDR) rate than non-ICU-HAP isolates (p &lt; 0.005) in those with &gt;=1 MDR risk factor. Non-susceptibility to imipenem (p &lt; 0.0005), piperacillin-tazobactam (p &lt; 0.001), cefepime (p &lt; 0.005), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p &lt; 0.05) in Gram-negative pathogens increased over time in both ICU and non-ICU settings. Conclusions: S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, and E. aerogenes were the leading isolates in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients. Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative pathogens in neurologic patients with culture-positive HAP has recently increased."

The data concerning the link between multidrug-resistance of A. baumannii strains and outcomes remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to identify the relation of risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and mortality with the drug resistance profiles of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) and independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Methods: A retrospective ongoing cohort study of 60 patients that were treated for VAP due to drug-resistant A. baumannii in medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU) over a two-year period was conducted. Results: The proportions of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and potentially pandrug-resistant (pPDR) A. baumannii were 13.3%, 68.3%, and 18.3%, respectively. The SAPS II scores on ICU admission were 42.6, 48.7, and 49 (p = 0.048); hospital length of stay (LOS) prior to ICU was 0, one, and two days (p = 0.036), prior to mechanical ventilation (MV)-0, 0, and three days (p = 0.013), and carbapenem use prior to VAP-50%, 29.3%, and 18.2% (p = 0.036), respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 63.3%. In MDR, XDR, and pPDR A. baumannii VAP groups, it was 62.5%, 61.3%, and 72.7% (p = 0.772), respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that female gender (95% OR 5.26; CI: 1.21-22.83), SOFA score on ICU admission (95% OR 1.28; CI: 1.06-1.53), and RBC transfusion (95% OR 5.98; CI: 1.41-25.27) were all independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: The VAP risk factors: higher SAPS II score, increased hospital LOS prior to ICU, and MV were related to the higher resistance profile of A. baumannii. Carbapenem use was found to be associated with the risk of MDR A. baumannii VAP. Mortality due to drug-resistant A. baumannii VAP was high, but it was not associated with the A. baumannii resistance profile. Female gender, SOFA score, and RBC transfusion were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality."

The emergence of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) is of major concern. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology, microbiology, and predictors of infection-related 30-day mortality in HAP with GNB. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of HAP patients with GNB occurring from January 2014 and December 2017. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: During the observational period, there were 1472 cases of HAP; 314 cases were bacterial culture-positive, 269 cases were caused by GNB, with a predominance of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mortality related to GNB was 14.5% (39 deaths).In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for mortality were age &gt;70 years, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, blood lymphocyte count &lt; 0.8 x 109/L, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria(MDR-GNB) infection, and elevation of blood urea nitrogen(BUN) level.

Recent reports highlight the increasing prevalence of resistance to colistin, a last resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. We retrospectively evaluated the potential efficacy, in terms of clinical and microbiological cure and mortality, of a combination of intravenous colistin and high-dose ampicillin/sulbactam and high-dose tigecycline, concurrently administered with inhaled colistin, in 10 ICU patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by carbapenem- and colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains, with high tigecycline MICs &gt; 2mug/mL. Nine patients (90%) exhibited a successful clinical outcome, accompanied by microbiological eradication in seven of them. All clinically cured patients survived at 14 and 28 days. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was observed in one patient. In view of the increasing prevalence of pan-drug resistant A. baumannii infections in ICUs, its associated high rates of mortality and the lack of effective treatment options, we feel that there is an emerging need for our results to be further validated in larger prospective studies."

It mostly affects debilitated patients, causing pneumonia and bloodstream infections with high mortality rates. Difficulties in treating CRAB infections stem from a formidable resistance profile that leaves available only a few antibiotics of uncertain efficacy such as colistin and tigecycline. Despite the relentless attempts to improve therapeutic approaches (as depicted in colistin-oriented randomized clinical trials and the numerous observational studies), progress is still limited. AIMS: We aim (a) to assist physicians to adapt therapeutic approaches in CRAB infections by considering all potentially available antimicrobials, and (b) to present directions for future investigations that emerge through treatment efforts in endemic settings. SOURCES: Articles and reviews from PubMed and Scopus databases; studies from ClinicalTrials.gov; presentations from ECCMID congresses and IDWeek meetings. CONTENT: The review provides a succinct overview of the important pharmacokinetic/pharmocodynamic parameters of relevant antimicrobial agents, a critical appraisal of randomized control trials and observational studies, suggestions for increasing the strength of observational studies and directions facilitating the choice of therapeutic regimens by severity of infection and status of the host. IMPLICATIONS: The lack of an optimal therapeutic regimen for CRAB thus far, as shown in this review, suggests the need to thoroughly investigate alternative approaches through carefully designed trials that should include all relevant drugs.

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of nosocomial acquired MDRAB bacteremia and to determine the risk factors related to the mortality of patients with MDRAB bacteremia. Patients with nosocomial acquired A baumannii bacteremia were enrolled between January, 2013 and December, 2017 at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. Medical records were reviewed, and the clinical and microbial characteristics were collected. Among the 338 patients suffering from A baumannii bacteremia, 274 patients were infected with MDRAB bacteremia. Bacteremia-related mortality was 46.4% for the overall sample; 56.2% for MDRAB bacteremia patients, 4.7% for non-MDRAB bacteremia patients. The identified risk factors for developing MDRAB bacteremia were previous exposure to carbapenems [odds ratio (OR) 5.78, P = .005] and penicillins+beta-lactamase inhibitors (OR 4.29, P = .009). Primary bacteremia tended to develop non-MDR bacteremia (OR 0.10, P = .002). The risk factors for MDRAB bacteremia-related mortality were old age (OR 1.02, P = .036), a high Pitt bacteremia score (OR 1.32, P &lt; .001), bacteremia occurring after severe pneumonia (OR 8.66, P &lt; .001), while catheter-related infection (OR 0.47, P = .049) and operations for treating infection (OR 0.51, P = .043) may have a better outcome. Patients with MDRAB had a higher mortality rate. Patients with previous carbapenems and penicillins+beta-lactamase inhibitor exposure are at an increased risk of MDRAB bacteremia, whereas patients with primary bacteremia tended to develop non-MDR bacteremia.

We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the risk factors for mortality due to A. baumannii bacteremia in children. Materials and Methods: We reviewed data from Seoul National University Children's Hospital from 2002 to 2013 for children with A. baumannii bacteremia, including age, gender, underlying disease, associated site of infection, duration of hospitalization, presence of neutropenia, and antibiotic susceptibility data. The outcome measures were the 7- and 30-day mortality rates. Results: Among 74 A. baumannii bacteremia cases, 35.1% were carbapenem nonsusceptible. Common comorbidities were malignancy or hematologic diseases (28.4%), followed by gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary diseases (21.6%). A total of 47.3% of patients had isolated bacteremia, and in 33.8% of patients, pneumonia accompanied bacteremia. The mortality rates were 18.9% at 7 days and 35.1% at 30 days. The significant associated factors for 30-day mortality were carbapenem nonsusceptibility (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-11.82, p = 0.034), neutropenia (aHR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.60-18.03, p = 0.007), and prior intensive care unit (ICU) admission (aHR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-9.73, p = 0.045). The mortality rate among neutropenic patients with inappropriate empirical antibiotics was higher than that among patients with appropriate empirical antibiotics (90.1% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.031). Conclusions: We identified carbapenem nonsusceptibility, neutropenia, and prolonged ICU stay as independent risk factors for mortality due to A. baumannii bacteremia in children.

Independent risk factors for mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 patients with S. aureus pneumonia were included in our study, including 144 with DM and 221 non-DM. DM patients were more susceptible to MRSA infection (65.3% vs. 56.1%, P &gt; 0.05), suffered from much severer pneumonia with a higher CURB-65 score, invasive mechanical ventilation rate (46.5% vs. 28.1%, P &lt; 0.01) and mortality rates (30.6% vs. 23.1%, P &gt; 0.05); almost all DM patients had higher antimicrobial resistance than non-DM patients, the DM group had a higher co-infection rate (47.2% vs. 45.7%, P &gt; 0.05), and Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common bacterium in DM, while Klebsiella pneumoniae ranked first in patients with non-DM. Independent risk factors for pneumonia-related mortality were MRSA and CURB-65. Higher HbA1c levels were linked to a higher MRSA infection and co-infection rate and more severe pneumonia, leading to an increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: DM patients with poor glucose control are more susceptible to MRSA infection. They suffer from higher antimicrobial resistance, a higher co-infection rate, and much severer pneumonia than non-DM. MRSA itself is an independent risk factor for mortality in all patients."

The increase in multi-drug resistant bacteria has not been accompanied by the validation of new drugs, or by any new antimicrobial strategies to exploit the available agents. VAP due to Gram-negative bacteria has increased mortality, both due to the resistant pathogens themselves and due to inappropriate treatment. Local epidemiology, patients' characteristics and clinical responses provide the most important information for therapeutic decision-making. Moreover, data on VAP therapy due to resistant bacteria are lacking, and the choice of treatment is often based on clinical practice and individual experience. Areas covered: This review summarizes the strategies available for treating the three most prevalent resistant Gram-negative organisms causing VAP: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. The review covers the results of a Pubmed search, clinical practice guidelines and reviews, and the authors' experience. Expert opinion: The existing evidence focuses on bloodstream infections or other sites rather than pneumonia and there are no recommendations for the treatment of VAP by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, especially for combination regimens. The approval of new drugs is needed to provide effective and safe alternatives for treating carbapenemase-producing strains. Precision medicine and personalized approach are also fundamental in future research."

Acinetobacter baumanii (AB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are important pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a trend of high resistance to carbapenems. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors for VAP due to carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (CRAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) in children. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, an active, prospective observational study was conducted in Gazi University Hospital. Patients from Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), between 1 month and 12 years of age with VAP due to AB and PA were included. RESULTS: During this period, 74 children experienced 126 VAP episodes due to Acinetobacter baumanii (N.=58) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N.=68). Among these, 93.1% (N.=54) of AB and 51.5% (N.=35) of PA were carbapenem resistant. In univariate analysis, length of stay in PICU until the diagnosis of VAP, presence of central venous catheters, prior use of cefepime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, and teicoplanin were associated with VAP due to CRPA (P=0.02, P=0.02, P=0.006, P=0.01, P=0.001, and P=0.009 respectively). Significant association was not found between the development of VAP due to CRAB and the investigated risk factors. Regression analyses revealed previous use of cefepime (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.016-0.595, P=0.039) and colistin (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 0.061-0.789, P=0.023) to be independently associated with VAP due to CRPA. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that broad spectrum antibiotic usage was the most important risk factor for the development of VAP due to CRPA."

RECENT FINDINGS: A. baumannii is a major cause of nosocomial pneumonia in certain geographic areas affecting mainly debilitated patients, with prolonged hospitalization and broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Inappropriate empirical treatment has clearly been associated with increased mortality in A. baumannii pneumonia. Carbapenems may not be considered the treatment of choice in areas with high rates of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Nowadays, polymyxins are the antimicrobials with the greatest level of in-vitro activity. Colistin is the antimicrobial most widely used although polymyxin B is associated with less renal toxicity. It is clear that lung concentrations of polymyxins are suboptimal in a substantial proportion of patients. This issue has justified the use of combination therapy or adjunctive nebulized antibiotics. Current evidence does not allow us to recommend combination therapy for A. baumannii pneumonia. Regarding nebulized antibiotics, it seems reasonable to use in patients who are nonresponsive to systemic antibiotics or A. baumannii isolates with colistin minimum inhibitory concentrations close to the susceptibility breakpoints. Cefiderocol, a novel cephalosporin active against A. baumannii, may represent an attractive therapeutic option if ongoing clinical trials confirm preliminary results. SUMMARY: The optimal treatment for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia has not been established. New therapeutic options are urgently needed. Well designed, randomized controlled trials must been conducted to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of nebulized antibiotics for the treatment of A. baumannii pneumonia."

OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively assess the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases were searched up to 12 March 2019. Studies were included if they compared tigecycline-based regimens with other antibiotic regimens for treating AB pulmonary infections and we pooled the clinical outcomes, microbiological response, adverse events or mortality. RESULTS: One prospective study and nine retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed similar clinical cure rates (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.60-1.81; P = 0.89) and mortality rates (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.65-1.89; P = 0.71) comparing tigecycline groups with the control groups. However, a significantly lower microbiological eradication rate was found in the tigecycline groups (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27-0.66; P = 0.0001). Incidence of nephrotoxicity in tigecycline-based regimens was significantly lower than in colistin-based regimens (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.16-0.74, I2 = 35%, P = 0.006). There were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included; incomplete safety data and regional bias caused by the majority of the studies originating in China are the main limitations of this meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline can be used for treating MDRAB pulmonary infections owing to efficacy similar to that of other antibiotics. Moreover, tigecycline did not show a higher risk of mortality. Considering the lower microbiological eradication rate for tigecycline, which is likely to induce antimicrobial resistance, well-designed RCTs for high-dose tigecycline in treating pneumonia caused by AB are still needed."

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for LRI. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we assessed the number of LRI and hospitalizations for LRI from 2004 to 2014 at the University Hospital Muenster Pediatric Department. We analyzed associations between LRI and clinical findings, and we cultured pathogens in tracheal aspirates (TAs) during noninfection periods. Univariable and multivariable negative, binomial regression analyses were applied to identify associations between possible risk factors and LRI. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients had 148 LRI, of which 99 were treated in hospital. The median number of LRI per year was 0.4. Six-hundred thirteen pathogens were detected in 315 specimens; Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6.2%) were most frequently detected. Acinetobacter baumannii is an independent risk factor for LRI (rate ratio, 1.792; P = 0.030) and hospital admissions for LRI (rate ratio, 1.917; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Children with a tracheostomy have frequent LRI. A. baumannii but not P. aeruginosa or S. aureus in TA is a risk factor for LRI in children with a long-term tracheostomy. This supports repetitive culture of TA for microbiologic workup to identify children and adolescents with an increased risk for LRI."

METHODS: We performed a systematic search of four databases for relevant studies. Meta-analysis was done based on United Nations geoscheme regions, individual countries and study period. We used a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence and mortality estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), weighted by study size. RESULTS: Among 6445 reports screened, we identified 126 relevant studies, comprising data from 29 countries. The overall prevalence of multidrug-resistance among A. baumannii causing HAP and VAP pooled from 114 studies was 79.9% (95% CI 73.9-85.4%). Central America (100%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (100%) had the highest prevalence, whereas Eastern Asia had the lowest (64.6%; 95% CI, 50.2-77.6%). The overall mortality estimate pooled from 27 studies was 42.6% (95% CI, 37.2-48.1%).

The aim of our study was to evaluate the demography, incidence, risk factors, causative bacterial pathogens and outcome of all episodes of Hospital-acquired pneumonia in our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study, at a tertiary university hospital during one year (2014) including all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Sixty patients were identified with pneumonia. Thirty-five (58.3%) had an intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, corresponding to 6.9 cases/1000 intubation-days. Antibiotic treatment in the previous 30 days was present in 75% of the cases. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 26.2%, 20.0% and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with late-onset hospital-acquired pneumonia (>= 7 days) showed higher frequency of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolates, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Combination therapy was performed in 67.0%, and de-escalation in 18.3%. The mortality rate was 18.3%. The adjusted odds ratio for intensive care unit mortality in the group of patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia was 5.2 (95% CI of 1.02 - 22.10; p = 0.046). DISCUSSION: The knowledge of local bacterial flora and resistance patterns is of crucial importance and strongly recommended. This evidence increases the probability of success of empiric antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: S. aureus was the predominant causative agent of nosocomial pneumonia. The most frequent risk factor identified for infection with multidrug-resistant organisms was previous treatment with antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant organisms were present in 45% of documented hospital-acquired pneumonias. In admitted patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, the intensive care unit mortality rate was nearly five times higher compared to intensive care unit acquired pneumonia."

Community-acquired pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter baumannii (CAP-Ab) is rare but fatal if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Conventional culture of clinical specimens is the main method for clinical diagnosis of A. baumannii infections which may suffer from limited positive rate and is time consuming. Timely and precise diagnosis of CAP-Ab remains challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old man with 24 h history of acute fever and dyspnea was admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed as severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP), septic shock, respiratory failure and acute kidney injury. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the patient's sputum and blood, which identified numerous A. baumannii nucleotide sequences in the sample of sputum and led to the rapid diagnosis and treatment of community acquired pneumonia caused by A. baumannii. This result was confirmed by subsequent sputum culture. CONCLUSIONS: This case described that the successful application of the next generation sequencing assisting the speedy diagnosis of A. baumannii infection provides a new idea for the timely diagnosis of CAP-Ab and highlights that NGS is a promising tool in rapid etiological diagnosis of acute and severe infectious diseases."

METHODS: Real-time surveillance was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All HAIs were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly >=60 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, chi2 = 202.421, P < 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower. CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher overall incidence of HAI in elderly inpatients >=60 compared to non-elderly inpatients < 60 years, but the trend was different for device-associated HAIs, which was attributed to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in the elderly group. The main HAI sites in elderly inpatients were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and bloodstream, and the main pathogens were gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans."

Methods: The epidemiological data of pathogenic bacteria and the use of common antibiotics in burn ward of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical College was investigated in the past 9 years. Bacteria samples were collected from the wounds, catheters, blood, feces, urine and sputum of inpatients in the unit from January 2010 to December 2018. The antibiotics use density was calculated by defined daily doses (DDDs)/(1 000 patient-days). Results: (1) In the proportion of bacteria detected, Staphylococcus aureus was the first and sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumonia (19.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (11.5%) were the top three Gram-negative bacteria in 2018; the proportion of Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly increased (R(2)=0.861, P<0.001). (2) The Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rate to ceftazidime (R(2)=0.447, P=0.049) and ciprofloxacin (R(2)=0.663, P=0.008) increased significantly. The Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rate to piperacillin (R(2)=0.999, P=0.018), meropenem (R(2)=0.999, P=0.023), ciprofloxacin (R(2)=1.000, P=0.010) increased significantly. There was no significant trend in the Acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate. (3) The use density of meropenem increased significantly (R(2)=0.492, P=0.035), and that of ciprofloxacin decreased significantly (R(2)=0.572, P=0.018). (4) Carbapenems use density was positively correlated with resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to cefoperazone sulbactam (r=0.733, P=0.025), piperacillin tazobactam (r=0.684, P=0.042), cefuroxime (r=0.821, P=0.023), ceftazidime (r=0.741, P=0.022), imipenem (r=0.718, P=0.029), meropenem (r=0.690, P=0.040), amikacin (r=0.750, P=0.020). (5) Ciprofloxacin use density was negatively correlated with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance rate to ceftazidime (r=-0.751, P=0.020), Ciprofloxacin (r=-0.873, P=0.002) and with the Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rate to cefuroxime (r=-0.767, P=0.044), ceftazidime (r=-0.712, P=0.031), imipenem (r=-0.780, P=0.013), meropenem (r=-0.793, P=0.011), ciprofloxacin (r=-0.871, P=0.002), Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (r=-0.793, P=0.011). Conclusion: Carbapenems can induce Klebsiella pneumoniae to be multiple drug resistance; through the relationship between ciprofloxacin use intensity and drug resistance, the strategy of only restricting a certain antimicrobial agent may not restore the bacterial sensitivity."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

The prevalence of these pathogens differs largely according to the local ecology and the geographical location. Identifying gram negative bacteria, and in particular resistant gram negative bacteria, is of paramount importance in patients with CAP because these pathogens are associated with higher clinical severity and unfavorable outcomes. The use of individualized risk factors to predict each pathogen is a helpful strategy that needs to be locally validated. However, it should be taken into account that most of the risk factors identified in the literature are heterogeneously defined or lack consistency. New diagnostic techniques, such as molecular testing, are promising methods for early detection of these gram negative pathogens. The increasing mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics of these pathogens have limited our therapeutic approach. This narrative review focuses on the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for the most relevant gram negative bacteria that cause CAP."

The development of AB resistance is becoming a global clinical challenge. To assist in the clinical management of AB-induced pneumonia, we designed the present retrospective observational study to investigate the risk factors for antimicrobial drug-resistant/-sensitive AB infections.A total of 214 individuals were reviewed, in which 100 and 55 pneumonia patients were infected with drug-resistant and drug-sensitive AB, respectively. Fifty-nine pneumonia patients without AB infection served as a control group. Age, sex, duration of hospital stay, prior surgery history, the presence of coinfection and companion diseases, routine blood test results, and immunogenicity were recorded. Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors of AB infections.Multivariate analysis revealed that long duration of hospital stay (odds ratio = 1.091 [95% CI: 1.010-1.178], P = .027) and the absence of coinfection (odds ratio = 0.507 [95% CI: 0.265-0.970], P = .040) were independent risk factors for AB infections. Same pattern of risk factors was identified for the drug-sensitive group (long duration of hospital stay: odds ratio = 1.119 [95% CI: 1.016-1.232], P = .022; absence of coinfection: odds ratio = 0.328 [95% CI: 0.135-0.797], P = .014), while high blood urea nitrogen (odds ratio: 1.382 [95% CI: 1.042-1.833], P = .025) was the only significant risk factor for drug-resistant AB infection.Long duration of hospital stay and the absence of coinfection might predict AB infections in hospitalized patients. Antimicrobial drug-resistant and drug-sensitive AB infections possess different risk factor profiles. A poor kidney function may be predictive of drug-resistant AB infection.

Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the common causes of VAPs around the world. METHODOLOGY: This research was a retrospective observational study in the intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary referral collegiate hospital in Tehran between March 2016 and May 2018. Patients who fulfilled VAP due to documented Multidrug Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) or Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) criteria were enrolled. General demographic features, duration of hospital stay, antimicrobial treatment regimens, duration of ICU admission, the period of mechanical ventilation (MV) and 30-day mortality were documented and compared. RESULTS: 210 patients were found with clinical, microbiological and radiological evidence of VAP. In total, 76 patients with MDR-AB and 76 patients with ESBL-KP infections were matched in the final analysis. Duration of hospitalization in the patients with MDR-AB was significantly more than that of patients infected with ESBL-KP (p-value: 0.045). Patients diagnosed with MDR-AB VAP had a 65.8% mortality rate compared to 42.1% in the ESBL-KP infection group (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study demonstrated that VAPs caused by MDR-AB may be more hazardous than ESBL-KP VAPs because they could be accompanied by a longer hospitalization course and even a higher mortality."

The risk factors of pneumonia in convalescent patients who have experienced stroke remain poorly defined. METHODS: To identify the risk factors of pneumonia, we applied logistic regression as a statistical method using SPSS23.0 statistical software, based on a sample of 380 patients. And statistical description method was used to analyze pathogens' characteristics and drug resistance. RESULTS: Ultimately, the obtained logistic model has statistical significance (chi2(13) = 91.560, P <0.0005). The sensitivity of the model is 41.7%, the specificity is 97.6%, the positive predictive value is 76.9%, and the negative predictive value is 89.8%. The Barthel index (BI) (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), basic lung diseases (OR=4.24, 95% CI: 1.02-17.61), trachea ventilation (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 1.18-36.34), feeding tube (OR=6.06, 95% CI: 2.59-14.18), and hypoproteinemia (OR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.56-10.10) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lower BI scores, basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are independent risk factors of pneumonia among convalescent patients with stroke. The main pathogens that caused pneumonia were gram-negative bacteria, and such organisms have different degrees of resistance to drugs."

Although acquiring any nosocomial infection is associated with increased mortality, we do not know if the acquisition of Acinetobacter infection confers a worse prognosis as compared to non-Acinetobacter-related HAI. The aim of the current study is to compare the clinical outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs) caused by A. baumannii with those caused by other bacterial pathogens. Materials and Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted among critically ill adults admitted to a tertiary care hospital in South India from January 2013 to June 2014. We enrolled patients who developed new-onset fever >=48 h after admission and fulfilled pre-specified criteria for VAP or CLABSI. The patients were followed up until the primary outcomes of death or hospital discharge. Results: During the study period, 4047 patients were admitted in the intensive care units, among which 129 eligible HAI events were analysed. Of these, 95 (73.6%) were VAP, 34 (26.4%) were CLABSI, 78 (60.4%) were A. baumannii-related HAI (AR-HAI) and 51 (39.6%) were non-A. baumannii-related HAI (NAR-HAI). Mortality among AR-HAI was 57.6% compared to 39.2% in NAR-HAI (P = 0.04) which on multivariate analysis did not achieve statistical significance, although the trend persisted (odds ratio [OR] = 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-18.4, P = 0.06). The acquisition of VAP due to A. baumannii was associated with poor ventilator outcomes even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.07-11.6, P = 0.04). Conclusion: In our cohort of critically ill adults with VAP and CLABSI, AR-HAI was associated with poor ventilator outcomes and a trend towards higher mortality. These findings add to the evidence suggesting that A. baumannii is a dangerous pathogen, perhaps even more so than others."

Multidrug Gram-negative bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are frequently associated with VAP in ICU. A prospective study was set up in three ICUs of the University Hospital Center Zagreb and one ICU in General Hospital Pula from September 2017 to March 2018. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution method. Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was determined by double-disk synergy test and carbapenemases by Hodge and carbapenem inactivation method (CIM). The genes encoding ESBLs, carbapenemases of class A, B and D and qnr genes were determined by PCR. In total 97 Gram-negative bacteria isolates were analyzed. P. aeruginosa demonstrated high resistance rates for imipenem and meropenem with 74% and 68% of resistant strains, respectively. Moderate resistance rates were observed for ceftazidime andpiperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (44%). All except three A. baumannii isolates, were resistant to carbapenems and to all other antibiotics apart from colistin and amikacin. Eight A. baumannii isolates were positive for bla OXA-23 and 12 for bla OXA-24 genes. Four K. pneumoniae and two E. cloacae strains were ESBL positive and harboured group 1 of CTX-M beta-lactamases. Three P. mirabilis strains were positive for plasmid-mediated ampC beta-lactamase of CMY family. Two carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae harboured OXA-48 and one carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae VIM-1. A high proportion of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and extensively resistant A. baumannii was reported. Acquired resistance mechanisms, mainly production of carbapenemases and ESBLs were dominant in A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates was more likely due to upregulation of efflux pumps or porin loss. A marked diversity of beta-lactamases was identified in Enterobacteriaceae."

The rapid development of antibiotic resistance exhibited by Enterobacteriaceae has caused an increasing concern regarding untreatable bacterial infections. Here, we isolated four pathogens from a geriatric female patient who was hospitalized for a month with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fever. The organisms isolated from the tracheal aspirates and urine included Klebsiella pneumoniae, pandrug-resistant Providencia rettgeri, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistome analysis indicated that the bacterial isolates from the polymicrobial infection were multiple-drug resitnat and pandrug resistant clones. Molecular characterization revealed presence of blaTEM-1 in K. pneumonaie, P. rettgeri and A. baumannii. The blaTEM-1 and blaNDM-1 genes were present in P. rettgeri and A. baumannii, whereas the blaTEM-1, blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23 traits were present in A. baumannii isolates.

Parenteral administration of colistin results in poor alveolar penetration and subtherapeutic concentration; therefore, direct drug deposition at site of infection may improve the effectiveness while minimizing the systemic exposure. The aim of this study is to describe the safety and effectiveness of inhaled colistin for the treatment of NP caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens. Method: Patients who received inhaled colistin from May 2015 to May 2019 at 2 different tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were identified from pharmacy databases and their charts were retrospectively reviewed. Results: 86 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 56 +- 20 years. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) was 17 +- 5. The responsible pathogens for NP were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%) Acinetobacter baumannii (28%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%). Most patients (76/86) received concomitant intravenous antibiotics. Mean colistin total daily dose was 6 +- 3 million international units divided into 2-3 doses. Mean inhaled colistin duration of therapy was 11 +- 6 days. Favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 51 (59%) patients while favorable microbiological outcome occurred in 29 (34%) patients. Death due to all causes was noted in 39 (45%) cases. Renal injury occurred in 19 (22%) patients, all received concomitant intravenous colistin. Conclusion: Inhaled colistin can be considered as salvage therapy as adjunct to intravenous administration for treatment of patients with NP due to MDR Gram-negative pathogens."

In this study we present a global in vivo transcriptomic analysis of A. baumannii isolated from the lungs of mice with pneumonia infection. MATERIAL/METHODS: Mice were infected with A. baumannii ATCC 17978 and AbH12O-A2 strains and the total bacterial RNA was analyzed by RNA-seq. Lists of differentially expressed genes were obtained and 14 of them were selected for gene deletion and further analysis. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed a specific gene expression profile in A. baumannii during the lung infection with up-regulation of genes involved in iron acquisition and host invasion. Mutant strains lacking the feoA, mtnN, yfgC, basB, hisF, oatA and bfnL showed a significant loss of virulence in murine pneumonia. A decrease in biofilm formation, adherence to human epithelial cells and growth rate was observed in some mutants. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an insight into the A. baumannii gene expression profile during the murine pneumonia infection. Data revealed that 7 in vivo up-regulated genes were involved in virulence, and could be considered new therapeutic targets."

Methods: A total of 1 872 neonates, who were admitted into NICU of Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital and subjected to mechanical ventilation from October 2016 to June 2018, were enrolled in the study. The neonates who met the diagnostic criteria of VAP were selected as the case group, and those who were treated with ventilator for 48 hours at the same time were regarded as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of VAP. Results: Of the 1 872 neonates who underwent the mechanical ventilation, the VAP occurred in 160 cases with the incidence rate of 8.5% (160 cases). The 227 specimens were collected. Gram-positive bacteria (n=116, 51.1%) were the main pathogens. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii. By Chi-square test, birth weight, birth age, Apgar score, duration of ventilator, and whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension were influencing factors. The result of logistic regression analysis showed that compared with no pregnancy included hypertension, the first aid measure at birth was initial resuscitation, and the MV time <= 5 days, the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates included: their mothers with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, using of tracheal intubation and ventilator time more than 5 days. Conclusion: The incidence of VAP in neonates receiving continuous MV therapy in neonatal intensive care unit is higher. Gram-positive bacteria are the main pathogens.

We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure. RESULTS: From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the predictors of co-infection together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia."

The aim of the study was to analyze the microbial factors of HAIs and the drug resistance of microorganisms to selected antibiotics and their consumption. Material and Methods: The retrospective study included 3708 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Teaching Hospital in Wroclaw, who were diagnosed with 742 HAIs in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018. The aim of the study was the analysis of microorganisms isolated in the respective clinical forms of HAIs, including the occurrence of ""alert pathogens"", presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and consumption of selected antibiotics. Findings: During the study period, 846 microorganisms were cultured in patients with HAIs, and among them, Acinetobacter baumannii MDR represented 31.8%; Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBLs, 11.3%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR, 4.1% and MRSA, 2.2%; and Enterococcus spp. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 1.3%. Among all the pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were dominant (71.6%). Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 21.6% and 7%, respectively. The total number of strains responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central line-associated blood stream infection (CLA-BSI) was as follows: 458 (54.1%), 274 (32.4%), and 114 (13.5%), respectively. Among the etiological factors of VAP, there was a prevalence of A. baumannii MDR (41.9%), as well as in the case of UTI (21.9%). With regards to CLA-BSI, MRCNS (29.8%) was the dominant pathogen. The ""alert pathogens"" accounted for 54.7% of all the analyzed strains. The MDR strains represented 72.6% and 9.7% among A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In the years 2011 vs. 2018, an increase in infections with MDR bacilli was observed, 34.6% vs. 61.0% (p = 0.0008), respectively, including A. baumannii MDR 16.54% vs. 34.56 % (p = 0.0009) and Enterobacterales ESBL+/AMPC 11.8% vs. 15.44 % (p = 0.3921). Resistance to methicillin was confirmed in 35.2% of S. aureus strains. Resistance to vancomycin was found among 30.9% of Enterococcus spp. The observed period was marked by an increase in the consumption of carbapenems: 197.7 vs. 235.9 defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patients-days. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be dominant pathogens in healthcare-associated infections. The most frequently cultured pathogens were multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae ESBL(+), and P. aeruginosa.

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of appropriate antimicrobial therapy on 14-day mortality in A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia patients after adjusting for risk factors. METHODS: This study was conducted at five medical centers in Taiwan between July 2012 and June 2016. A. baumannii species identification was performed using reference molecular methods. Risk factors for 14-day mortality were analyzed via logistic regression. The interaction between the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and appropriate antimicrobial therapy was assessed using the logistic model. RESULTS: A total of 336 patients with monomicrobial A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia were included in this study. The overall 14-day mortality rate was 47.3%. The crude mortality of appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 35.9% (57 of 151 patients). Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with a lower mortality after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.97; p = 0.04), and the effect was influenced by APACHE II score (OR for interaction term, 0.0098; 95% CI, 0.0005-0.1885; p = 0.002).

Cox regression analysis of factors associated with 30-day mortality, after propensity score, showed that septic shock, and secondary bacteremia were associated with death, while a fosfomycin-containing regimen was associated with 30-day survival. Antibiotic combinations with fosfomycin in definitive therapy for 44 patients were: fosfomycin + colistin in 11 (25%) patients followed by fosfomycin + carbapenem + tigecycline in 8 (18.2%), fosfomycin + colistin + tigecycline in 7 (15.9%), fosfomycin + rifampin in 7 (15.9%), fosfomycin + tigecycline in 6 (13.6%), fosfomycin + carbapenem in 3 (6.8%), and fosfomycin + aminoglycoside in 2 (4.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This real-life clinical experience concerning the therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia caused by MDR-AB provides useful suggestions to clinicians, showing the use of different antibiotic regimens with a predominant role for fosfomycin. Further randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm or exclude these observations."

Meanwhile, polymyxin B is associated with several adverse effects. However, there is a lack of awareness that polymyxin B can cause rhabdomyolysis. In this study, we firstly report a case of polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis during antiinfection therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old woman suffering from rheumatic heart disease underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement at our institute. Subsequently, she developed bacteremia and pneumonia caused by extensively drug resistance-acinetobacter baumannii. Polymyxin B was administered for 5 days. During treatment, the patient complained of muscle pain and limb weakness, and her serum creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin levels rose. DIAGNOSIS: The clinical symptoms and laboratory examination confirmed rhabdomyolysis, and polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis was considered. INTERVENTION: We ceased polymyxin B treatment and monitored the patient daily. OUTCOMES: Serum creatine phosphokinase levels returned to normal, myoglobin levels decreased, and muscle pain was significantly alleviated after cessation of polymyxin B. We identified this as a case of polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis. LESSONS: Here, we report the first reported case of rhabdomyolysis induced by polymyxin B administration. The awareness of rare adverse reaction helps ensure the clinical safety of polymyxin B treatment."

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of isolation of the species that constitute the Acb complex, as well as their susceptibility to antibiotics, and their distribution at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). A total of 88 strains previously identified by Vitek 2 , 40 as Acinetobacter baumannii and 48 as Acb complex were isolated from 52 children from 07, January 2015 to 28, September 2017. A. baumannii accounted for 89.77% (79/88) of the strains; Acinetobacter pittii, 6.82% (6/88); and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, 3.40% (3/88). Most strains were recovered mainly from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency wards. Blood cultures (BC) provided 44.32% (39/88) of strains. The 13.63% (12/88) of strains were associated with primary bacteremia, 3.4% (3/88) with secondary bacteremia, and 2.3% (2/88) with pneumonia. In addition, 44.32% (39/88) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains and, 11.36% (10/88) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). All strains amplified the bla OXA-51 gene; 51.13% (45/88), the bla OXA-23 gene; 4.54% (4/88), the bla OXA-24 gene; and 2.27% (2/88), the bla OXA-58 gene. Plasmid profiles showed that the strains had 1-6 plasmids. The strains were distributed in 52 pulsotypes, and 24 showed identical restriction patterns, with a correlation coefficient of 1.0. Notably, some strains with the same pulsotype were isolated from different patients, wards, or years, suggesting the persistence of more than one clone. Twenty-seven sequence types (STs) were determined for the strains based on a Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme using massive sequencing; the most prevalent was ST 156 (27.27%, 24/88). The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas I-Fb system provided amplification in A. baumannii and A. pittii strains (22.73%, 20/88). This study identified an increased number of MDR strains and the relationship among strains through molecular typing. The data suggest that more than one strain could be causing an infection in some patient. The implementation of molecular epidemiology allowed the characterization of a set of strains and identification of different attributes associated with its distribution in a specific environment."

The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline, the prevalence of tet(A) and tet(B) determinants, and the role of efflux pump in tetracycline resistance among the A. baumannii clinical isolates. Susceptibility of 98 A. baumannii isolates to tetracyclines was evaluated by disk diffusion method. The presence of active efflux pump was investigated by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline using the carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to investigate the presence of tet(A) and tet(B) determinants in tetracycline-resistant isolates. The rate of resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline was 47.95%, 0%, and 30.61%, respectively. Among the 47 tetracycline-resistant isolates, 29.79% were originated from burned patients and showed MIC ranging from 128-256 mug/mL with both MIC 50 and MIC90 values of 256 mug/mL, while 70.21% were from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients and had MIC values ranging from 32-1024 mug/mL, with MIC50 and MIC90 of 512 mug/mL and 1024 mug/mL, respectively. The tet(B) gene was found in 61.7% of tetracycline-resistant isolates, while none of the isolates carried the tet(A) gene. CCCP led to 2-128-fold reduction in tetracycline MIC of the tested isolates. The results showed that doxycycline and minocycline are promising agents for the treatment of A. baumannii infections. This study has also revealed the role of efflux activity in the resistance to tetracycline of A. baumannii isolates. The emergence of resistance to these agents is likely due to the spread of clones presenting with a higher prevalence of resistance determinants."

Patients and Methods: A total of 366 patients who were diagnosed with HAP caused by MDR-AB infection were enrolled between January 2013 and December 2016. The sociological characteristics and clinical data of these cases were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were used to explore the risk factors of hospital deaths before medication and after drug withdrawal. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were utilized to assess the predictive effectiveness of the models with or without the adjustment. Results: Hospital deaths occurred in 142 cases (38.80%). The results showed that acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores before medication and after drug withdrawal were associated with the risk of hospital deaths. Adjusting the covariants including the age, autoimmune disease, venous cannula, transfer of patients from other hospitals, and APACHE II score at admission, then no differences were discovered in predicting the hospital deaths between adjusted APACHE II and adjusted SOFA scores before medication (AUC: 0.808 vs 0.803, P =0.614) and after drug withdrawal (AUC: 0.876 vs 0.878, P =0.789). Conclusion: Before medication or after drug withdrawal, the adjusted APACHE II and adjusted SOFA scores all performed well in determining the predictive effectiveness of the hospital deaths in patients with HAP caused by MDR-AB infection, indicating that the appropriate infection control may reduce the occurrence of nosocomial deaths and improve the prognosis."

METHODS: This study included all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the ICU between the period of January 2018 to December 2019. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients in pneumonia were included. Mortality rate was 45.9%. In patients with HAP had higher length of stay days in hospital and ICU, the use of sedative agents, sepsis rate and mortality rate as compared in patients with CAP (for all p<0.05). Microorganism was identified in 27(36.6%) of the patients. Respiratory samples were positive in 25.4% of patients with CAP and 60.8% of patients with HAP. Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent etiologic agents (40.7% and 22.2%, respectively). Acinetobacter baumannii was not susceptible to the third generation cephalosporin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, fluoroquinolone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Among gram-positive bacteria, the most common isolate was staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 75% but these isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The predominance of gram-negative agents was observed in pneumonia patients and due to the high resistance to antibiotics, treatment strategies need to be reconsidered in order to improve the poor prognosis."

METHODS: Patients with sepsis caused by A. baumannii pulmonary infection were recruited and divided into an observational group (phase 1) and treatment group (phase 2). Both groups received standard therapy for sepsis, and patients in phase 2 also received nurse-led, goal-directed lung physical therapy.The primary outcome measure was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Among 742 septic patients, 201 were diagnosed with A. baumannii pulmonary infection. Compared with patients in phase 1, the patients in phase 2 had a significantly lower MV duration [days: 4 (3,5) vs. 5 (3,12), p = 0.004 ], ICU mortality [13.6% (18/132) vs. 27.5% (19/69), p = 0.016], and 28-day mortality[21.2% (28/132) vs.37.7% (26/69), p = 0.012]. As a protective factor, nurse-led, goal-directed lung physical therapy (OR 0.341, 95% CI, 0.155-0.751, p = 0.008) was an independent risk factor of 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led, goal-directed lung physical therapy shortened MV duration and ICU stay, and decreased ICU and 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis caused by A. baumannii pulmonary infection."

The absence of an available vaccine coupled with emerging multidrug resistance has prevented the medical community from effectively controlling this human pathogen. Furthermore, the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has increased the risk of hospitalized patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by bacterial opportunists including A. baumannii. The shortage of antibiotics in the development pipeline prompted the World Health Organization to designate A. baumannii a top priority for the development of new medical countermeasures, such as a vaccine. There are a number of important considerations associated with the development of an A. baumannii vaccine, including strain characteristics, diverse disease manifestations, and target population. In the past decade, research efforts have revealed a number of promising new immunization strategies that could culminate in a safe and protective vaccine against A. baumannii. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in the development of A. baumannii vaccines, discuss potential challenges, and propose future directions to achieve an effective intervention against this human pathogen."

METHODOLOGY: A total of 92 A. baumannii isolates were collected between 2012 and 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testings were performed for beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin and colistin. The phenotypic characterization of beta-lactamases was investigated. For 30 randomly targeted strains, the carriage of the carbapenemases, ESBL and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes -encoding genes was determined by PCR. Sequencing was carried out for carbapenemases and ESBL genes. RESULTS: Most of the 92 isolates studied were recovered from hospitalized patients (93.5%) and were mainly from intensive care units (51.1%) and orthopedics (19.6%). The strains were collected primarily from low respiratory tract (33.7%), wounds (23.9%) and urine (16.3%). Multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strains were prevalent (96.7%). High rates of resistance were observed for almost all antibiotics tested (>70%) excluding rifampicin (7.6%) and colistin (5.4%). For the five colistin-resistant strains, MICs ranged between 4 and 128 microg/mL. Positive MBL (83.7%) and ESBL (23.9%) strains were identified. Regarding beta-lactams, the blaNDM and both blaSHV and blaCTX-M1 genes were detected in five and two strains respectively. Sequencing of the genes revealed the presence of blaNDM-1, blaCTX-M-15, and blaSHV-33.

Methods: Non-duplicated nosocomial cases as well as pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from 11 teaching hospitals across China were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clinically significant strains were determined by agar dilution method or broth microdilution method. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S29 criteria were used for interpretation, and the WHONET-5.6 software was used in data analysis. Results: A total of 1 590 cases were collected, including 831 cases from BSI, 450 cases from HAP and 309 cases from IAI. The most prevalent pathogens causing BSI were Escherichia coli (29.2%, 243/831), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%, 135/831) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%, 84/831); the most prevalent pathogens causing IAI were E. coli (26.2%, 81/309), Enterococcus faecium (15.5%, 48/309) and K. pneumoniae (13.3%, 41/309); while Acinetobacter baumanii (24.7%, 111/450), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%, 93/450) and K. pneumoniae (16.2%, 73/450) were dominated in HAP. All S. aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides; 77.8% (105/135) of S. aureus strains were susceptible to ceftaroline. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.6% (40/135) of all the S. aureus, and was lower than the accounted rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) (83.7%, 41/49). One E. faecium strain (1.1%, 1/95) resistant to vacomycin and teicoplanin and one E. faecalis strain (2.3%, 1/43) resistant to linezolid was found. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 56.1% (193/344) in E. coli and 22.1% (55/249) in K. pneumonia; the rate of carbapenem resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 4.1% (14/344) and 22.9% (57/249), respectively; the percentage of ceftazidime/avibactam resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 2.3% (8/344) and 2.0% (5/249), respectively; the percentage of colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 1.5% (5/344) and 7.6% (19/249), respectively; no E. coli and K. pneumonia strains were found resistant to tigecycline. The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa were 78.9% (146/185) and 36.7% (66/180), respectively. A. baumanii showed low susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents except colistin (99.5%, 184/185) and tigecycline (91.4%, 169/185). Colistin, amikacin and ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa with susceptility rate of 100% (180/180), 93.3% (168/180) and 85.6% (154/180), respectively. Conclusions: Nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens show high susceptibilities to tigecycline, colistin and ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro. Antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii is a serious problem. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has increased, which should be monitored continuously in China."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out at the NICU of St George University Hospital, Plovdiv, Bul-garia from January 1, 2017 to June 31, 2018. The number of neonates included in the study was 507. Descriptive statistics such as count,  percent, mean and standard deviation was used. Chi-square test was performed to prove associations. Odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were computed from the results of the binominal logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 507 hospitalized newborns in NICU, 48 presented with 54 NI. The incidence and the density incidence rates were 9.5% and 7.67 per 1,000 patient-days, respectively. Nosocomial infections were detected in neonates from all birth weight (BW) classes, but it was low BW and premature neonates that were at major risk to acquire them. The most common infection sites were ventilator-asso-ciated pneumonia (VAP) (67.27%), bloodstream infection (23.64%) and conjunctivitis (9.09%). Major pathogens were Gram-negative such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis NIs were strongly associated with intubation, presence of a venous catheter, the duration of antibiotic treatment and increased CRP> 10 mg/l.

The risk is especially high in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) particularly in infants with mechanically assisted ventilation. During the 5-year period of the study, 160 infants with problems including prematurity (60.6%), respiratory distress (55.6%) and birth asphyxia (45.0%) were admitted to the NICU. One hundred and thirty-three infants (83.1%) received mechanical ventilation. Nosocomial pneumonia was found in 65 infants (40.6%) or 88.3 cases per 1,000 ventilator-days. Low birth weight, prematurity, respiratory distress and hyperbilirubinemia were found more significantly in the pneumonia group. They underwent more manipulations such as the placement of an umbilical catheter and orogastric tube. Infants with pneumonia received mechanical ventilation at a higher percentage and for a longer period than those without pneumonia (96.9% vs 73.7%, odds ratio = 11.2, p = 0.000) with a mean duration of 11.7 and 3.5 days respectively (p = 0.000). The etiologic organisms recovered from hemoculture were Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus 44.0 per cent, Enterobacter spp. 16.0 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae 16.0 per cent, coagulase-negative staphylococci 12.0 per cent. There was no concordance of the bacteriologic results in endotracheal aspirate culture and hemoculture in each infant. Leukocytosis and granulocytosis as well as blood gas values could not differentiate the presence of pneumonia. The mean hospital stay for the infants with pneumonia was longer (23.0 days vs 6.4 days, p = 0.000). Nosocomial pneumonia did not only prolong hospital stay but also contributed to mortality. Twenty-seven (41.5%) of the infants with pneumonia died, compared with 46 (48.4%) of the other group without pneumonia (p = 0.422). The risk of nosocomial pneumonia can be reduced by using infection control measures, including meticulous hand washing and gloving during respiratory manipulation, heat-treated water supply in a nebulizing unit of the ventilator and proper care of umbilical catheterization."

The variant anitratus is the most clinically significant pathogen in this family, usually presenting as a lower respiratory tract infection. Acinetobacter has been demonstrated to be one of the most common organisms found in the ICU. We present three critically ill surgery patients with Acinetobacter pneumonia, high inspiratory pressures, and the subsequent development of pneumatoceles. One of these patients died from a ruptured pneumatocele, resulting in tension pneumothorax. Treatment of pneumatoceles should center on appropriate intravenous antimicrobial therapy. This should be culture directed but is most often accomplished with Imipenem.

Disease episodes diagnosed after the first 72 hours of hospitalisation (deemed no- socomial in origin), proved more frequent than community-acquired ones (9 cases versus 2), affected predominantly patients with AIDS and neutropenia, and were frequent1y associated with bacteremia (p&lt;.04) The use of broad spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids and cotrimoxazole, was recognized during the month preceding the diagnosis of Acinetobacter spp. disease, in 6, 4, and 8 cases, respectively. One patient only had an indwelling intravascular catheter, while no recent history of surgery, intensive care, or other invasive procedures was found. At in vitro susceptibility studies, bacterial isolates showed complete resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin, and low sensitivity to second-generation cephalosporins, while a higher susceptibility rate was revealed towards ceftazidime, netilmicin, amikacin, and quinolones, followed by cotrimoxazole and piperacillin. A prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy (mostly carried out with cephalosporins and aminoglycosides), led all patients to a clinical and microbiological cure within 6-1.3 days, in the absence of mortality or relapses. As opportunist pathogens with a predominant nosocomial origin, Acinetobacter spp. organisms may be responsible for an appreciable morbidity in patients with HIV disease, especially when additional risk factors (immunodeficiency, underlying diseases, and hospitalisation) are present. Notwithstanding the high drug resistance profile of the majority of isolated organisms, a timely diagnosis and a treatment based on in vitro assays, contribute to avoid recurrences and potentially life-threatening complications."

","SPECIES:Acinetobacter calcoaceticusID:16258323TITLE:Treatment of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter.ABSTRACT:PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex has become a serious nosocomial pathogen due to its persistence in the hospital environment and its broad antimicrobial resistance patterns. This review summarizes the most recent literature pertaining to the clinical management of infections with this bacteria emphasizing in-vitro antimicrobial resistance patterns and antimicrobial efficacy in animals and humans. RECENT FINDINGS: Although this pathogen can be associated with an elevated crude mortality, it only contributes to this mortality in a subset of high-risk patients. Determining in-vitro activity of antimicrobial agents can be problematic due to conflicting results sometimes obtained through different testing methods. There is no simple answer as to the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy secondary to lack of adequate studies. Imipenem/cilastatin, amikacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, colistin, rifampin, and tetracyclines are typically active against these bacteria. It is also not clear if combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy. In cases in which A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex bacteria are resistant to all available agents, we have prolonged infusion times, increased drug dose, and altered route of instillation, such as nebulized therapy for pulmonary infections with mixed results. A primary goal of A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex management should be to prevent initial colonization and subsequent infection by adequate infection control. SUMMARY: The A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex continues to play a significant role in our healthcare systems. Prompt and adequate therapy with agents having in-vitro activity is required once it is established that the bacteria represents infection and not colonization. Aggressive infection control policies should be enforced when this pathogen is identified."

","SPECIES:Acinetobacter calcoaceticusID:16409013TITLE:Nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.ABSTRACT:Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). Empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (&gt;/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines."

We analyzed epidemiological and microbiological characteristics and the outcome, in a cohort of critically-ill patients with confirmed diagnosis of VAP. All patients who had been on mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours were included in our study; material collection for microbiological analysis was done within the first 24 hours after beginning treatment or after changing antibiotics. There were 55/265 (20.7%) VAP cases diagnosed, at a rate of 21.6 episodes per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation. Mean age of the patients was 66 years, with a mean APACHE II score of 26.7 + 7.0; male patients were more prevalent. The mortality rates in the intensive care unit (ICU) and during the hospital stay were 71% and 80%, respectively. MV duration in patients with VAP was 17 (range 3-43) days and among patients who had not developed VAP, 6 (2-32) days (p &lt; 0.0001). 98.2% of the samples were positive, with a high prevalence of Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Risk factors for death included age, MV duration and surgery. VAP incidence in this sample of critically-ill patients was high, with a high mortality rate. Control and prevention strategies based on continuing education of healthcare workers, developed by a multidisciplinary team, should be encouraged to minimize morbimortality of this infection."

The 92 patients in the survey had a mean age of 56 (range 13-97) years. A microbiological diagnosis was established in 72%; Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18%), and influenza A virus (8%) were the most common microorganisms. Other causative organisms were Legionella pneumophila (4 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Nocardia brasiliensis (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). Chlamydia sp, influenza B virus and adenovirus were each found in one case; all were cultured on nasopharygeal aspirates. Aspiration was considered to be the underlying cause in five patients, two with epilepsy and one with pseudobulbar palsy. Five of the six deaths that occurred were in patients over 75 years of age and the other was 69. In four of the six the established causative organisms were Chlamydia sp (1), K pneumoniae (1), and S aureus (2). Patients had a 16 fold increased risk of death if they had two or more of the following on admission: a respiratory rate of 30/minute or more, diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and either confusion or a plasma urea concentration greater than 7.0 mmol/l."

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the clinical and microbiological outcomes of patients treated with tigecycline for serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex (Acb-complex). A retrospective study was conducted to define the patients who received tigecycline for carbapenem-resistant Acb-complex infections between 1 June, 2008 and 1 may, 2009. A total of 21 patients were eligible for the study. The median age of the patients was 48 years and 6 patients were female. Eighteen patients were treated with tigecycline for carbapenemresistant Acb-complex as the sole microorganism while 3 received it for polymicrobial infections. All Acb-complex isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. The most common indication of tigecycline treatment was surgical-site infections (SSI) followed by ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Tigecycline was the sole antibiotic administered in 7 patients while concurrent antibiotics were used in 14 patients. The median duration of tigecycline therapy was 14 days. Two patients died within 14 days of initiating treatment, representing an attributable mortality rate of 9.5% while 4 patients died within 30 days representing a crude mortality rate of 19.1%. Seventeen out of 21 patients had successful clinical outcomes, cure in 11 patients and improvement in 6. Fourteen of 21 patients had microbiological failure. Correlation between microbiological response with clinical outcome was poor. Clinical failure was more common in patients with VAP. Patients with bacteremia were more likely to have microbiological failure while microbiological outcome was better in patients with SSI. In this retrospective study, 81% (17 of 21) of the patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Acb-complex had a positive outcome under tigecycline therapy. However, these preliminary results should be evaluated cautiously in the absence of well-controlled studies."

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics of A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex (Acb complex) strains and to determine the risk factors of this infection. METHODS: The medical records of 121 patients at Nagasaki University Hospital from whom Acb complex had been isolated between January 2007 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient backgrounds, sensitivity to antibiotics, risk factors for infection, and prognosis were evaluated. RESULTS: Lower respiratory isolates accounted for 73% (147 strains) of all 201 isolates. Most of the isolates were sensitive to carbapenems. Of the 121 patients (74 males and 47 females; mean age: 62.1 years), 48 (39.7%) had malignancy and 75 (62.0%) were treated with antibiotics prior to isolation. Thirty-seven of the patients in this study (30.6%) were infected by Acb complex and the most frequent clinical manifestation was pneumonia (18 cases; 48.6%). Approximately 60% of infected patients were treated with beta-lactam agent in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors or carbapenems. The mortality rate of infected patients was significantly higher than that of colonized patients (infected: 24.3%, colonized: 6.0%, p&lt;0.05). Risk factors for Acb complex infection include being over 60 years of age, chronic liver disease, and the use of first-generation cephalosporins prior to isolation. CONCLUSION: Acb complex was relatively sensitive to antibiotics. The appropriate usage of antibiotics should be continued for the prevention of drug resistance in Acb complex."

Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic."

There are few data on the resistance of A. baumannii in Vietnam, which are essential for developing evidence-based treatment guidelines for HAIs. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was conducted by VITEK 2, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 66 clinical A. baumannii complex isolates recovered during 2009 at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases (NHTD), a referral hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Basic demographic and clinical data were collected and analysed using descriptive statistics. Most isolates came from lower respiratory tract specimens (59; 89.4%) from intensive care unit (ICU) patients [64/65 (98.5%) with available data] who had been admitted to NHTD for &gt;=2 days [42/46 (91.3%) with available data]. More than 90% of the isolates were resistant to the tested beta-lactamase/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Moreover, 25.4% (16/63) were resistant to all tested beta-lactams, quinolones and aminoglycosides. All isolates remained sensitive to colistin and 58.7% were susceptible to tigecycline. Of the 66 isolates, 49 could be classified into eight PFGE types (A-H). Every PFGE type, except D, had cluster(s) of three or more isolates with a temporal relationship. In conclusion, these data suggest a significant rise in A. baumannii antibiotic resistance in Vietnam. Clustering within PFGE types supports cross-transmission of A. baumannii within the ICU at NHTD.

Sulbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor with antimicrobial activity against MDR Acb complex. METHODS: To investigate outcomes of pneumonia involving MDR Acb complex treated with sulbactam or ampicillin/sulbactam for at least 7 days, we conducted a retrospective study of 173 adult patients over a 34 month period. RESULTS: Of 173 patients, 138 (79.8%) received combination therapy, mainly with carbapenems (119/138, 86.2%). The clinical response rate was 67.6% and the 30 day mortality rate was 31.2%. The independent predictors of clinical failure were malignancy, bilateral pneumonia and shorter duration of treatment. In patients with sulbactam-susceptible strains, there was no difference in clinical and microbiological outcome between combination therapy and monotherapy. Compared to the sulbactam-susceptible group, the sulbactam-resistant group had a lower rate of airway eradication, a longer duration of treatment and a higher rate of combination therapy with predominantly carbapenems (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in clinical resolution and 30 day mortality rates.

METHODS: Biochemical profiling, 16S rRNA sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed. Conjugation experiments were conducted to determine transmissibility of resistance. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing were performed to identify strain-specific features. RESULTS: The isolate XM1570 was identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.

Plasmid pXM1 carried the carbapenemase gene bla(NDM-1) and displayed high homology with previously described plasmids isolated from different Acinetobacter spp., which were collected from human or livestock distributed in China and worldwide. The bla(NDM-1) gene was located on this conjugative plasmid in a transposon-like region flanked by two copies of the insertion sequence ISAba125; and resistance to all tested beta-lactams was observed. Transferability of resistance from pXM1 to the transconjugants was identified.

Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections."

We studied the ICU-acquired infections and their effect on patient outcomes in our ICU. METHODS: Patients admitted to our ICU for &gt;48 hours were studied prospectively over a year. Infections were diagnosed based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Antibiotics were administered based on culture and sensitivity. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to determine the factors associated with infection. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-eight patients were studied. The crude infection rate was 50% with ventilator-associated pneumonia (40%) and bloodstream infection (21%) being the most common. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common microorganisms. More than 90% of patients received antibiotics, the most common being beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems. Thirty-five percent of staphylococci were methicillin-resistant, 50% of Enterococcus strains were vancomycin-resistant, and 68% of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, 47% of Pseudomonas strains, and 35% of Klebsiella strains were multidrug-resistant. A longer duration of ventilation was associated with infection. The overall ICU mortality rate was 24% and was similar in patients with or without infection. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of infection and the multidrug resistance in the ICU was high. Infection was associated with duration of ventilation but not mortality."

METHODS: To compare the efficacy of tigecycline-based with sulbactam (or ampicillin/sulbactam)-based therapy for pneumonia involving MDR Acb complex, we conducted a retrospective study comparing 84 tigecycline-treated adult patients during the period August 2007 to March 2010 with 84 sulbactam or ampicillin/sulbactam-treated adult patients during the period September 2004 to July 2007. Both groups had the matched Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and received treatment for at least 7 days. RESULTS: The mean APACHE II score was 20.1 for both groups. More patients in sulbactam group had ventilator use (89.3 % versus 69.0 %), bilateral pneumonia (79.8 % versus 60.7 %) and combination therapy (84.5 % versus 53.6 %), particularly with carbapenems (71.4 % versus 6.0 %), while more patients in tigecycline group had delayed treatment (41.7 % versus 26.2 %) (P &lt;0.05). At the end of treatment, more patients in sulbactam group had airway MDR Acb complex eradication (63.5 % versus 33.3 %, P &lt;0.05). The clinical resolution rate was 66.7 % for both groups. The mortality rate during treatment was 17.9 % in sulbactam group, and 25.0 % in tigecycline group (P = 0.259). The multivariate analysis showed that bilateral pneumonia was the only independent predictor for mortality during treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 2.717; 95 % confidence interval, 1.015 to 7.272).

Within the past two decades, Acinetobacter spp. have been responsible for an increasing number of infections in intensive care units (ICUs) globally. Treatment of Acinetobacter infections is difficult, as Acinetobacter spp. are intrinsically resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, and have a remarkable ability to acquire new resistance determinants via multiple mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the 1990s, global resistance to antimicrobials has escalated dramatically among ABC. Global spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii strains reflects dissemination of a few clones between hospitals, geographic regions, and continents; this spread is amplified by excessive use of antibiotics. Many isolates are resistant to all antimicrobials except colistin (polymyxin E), and some infections are untreatable with existing antimicrobial agents. SUMMARY: Antimicrobial resistance poses a serious threat to control infections due to ABC. Strategies to curtail environmental colonization with MDR-ABD will require aggressive infection control efforts and cohorting of infected patients. Thoughtful antibiotic strategies are essential to limit the consequences and spread of MDR-ABC. Optimal therapy will likely require combination antimicrobial therapy of existing antibiotics as well as development of novel antibiotic classes."

OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. RESULTS: The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use."

We report for the first time that A. pittii can be responsible for cavitary community-acquired pneumonia and study its virulence, and discuss its pathogenesis and treatment options. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old woman with a history of smoking and systemic lupus was admitted to Nimes University Hospital (France) with coughing and sputum lasting for three weeks. Thoracic CT scanner showed cavitary pneumonia. Broncho-alveolar lavage cultures found community-acquired Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. The clinical outcome was favourable after twenty-one days of antimicrobial treatment by piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin then cefepime. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analyses identified an A. pittii ST249. Despite the atypical clinical presentation with an unexpected partial destruction of lung parenchyma, we found very low virulence potential of the A. pittii strain with nematode killing assays and biofilm formation test. The median time required to kill 50% of the nematodes was 7 +- 0.3 days for A. pittii ST249, 7 +- 0.2 days for A. baumanii NAB ST2 and 8 +- 0.2 days for E. coli OP50, (p &gt; 0,05). A. pittii ST249 showed significantly slower biofilm formation than A. baumanii NAB ST2: BFI = 8.83 +- 0.59 vs 3.93 +- 0.27 at 2 h (p &lt; 0.0001), BFI = 6.3 +- 0.17 vs 1.87 +- 0.12 at 3 h (p &lt; 0.0001) and BFI = 3.67 +- 0.41 vs 1.7 +- 0.06 after 4 h of incubation (p &lt; 0.01).

This study investigated the clinical efficacy between aerosolized colistimethate sodium (AS-CMS, 2 million units thrice a day) treatment alone or in combination with standard-dose tigecycline (TGC) in patients with non-bacteremic pneumonia due to XDR-Acb, and explored the factors influencing patients' 30-day mortality.A 1:1 case (n = 106; receiving TGC plus AS-CMS) control (receiving AS-CMS alone with matching scores) observational study was conducted among adult patients with non-bacteremic XDR-Acb complex pneumonia in a Taiwanese medical center from January 2014 through December 2016. The clinically relevant data were retrospectively recorded. The primary endpoint was 30-day case fatality. Secondary endpoints investigated that if the co-morbidities, XDR-A. baumannii as a pneumonic pathogen, therapy-related factors, or airway colonization with colistin-resistant Acb negatively influenced the 14-day clinical condition of enrolled patients.A higher 30-day mortality rate was noted among the group receiving combination therapy (34.0% vs 22.6%; P = .17). The &gt;=7-day AS-CMS therapy successfully eradicated &gt; 90% of airway XDR-Acb isolates. Nevertheless, follow-up sputum specimens from 10 (6.4% [10/156]) patients were colonized with colistin-resistant Acb isolates. After the conditional factors were adjusted by multivariate logistic analysis, the only factor independently predicting the 30-day case-fatality was the failure of treating XDR-Acb pneumonia at 14 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 38.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.96-142.29; P &lt; .001). Cox proportional regression analysis found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.05-4.10; P = .035), chronic renal failure (aHR = 3.00; 95% CI = 1.52-5.90; P = .002), non-invasive ventilation use (aHR = 2.68; 95% CI = 1.37-5.25; P = .004), and lack of TGC therapy (aHR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.27-1.00; P = .049) adversely influenced the 14-day clinical outcomes. Conversely, the emergence of colistin-resistant Acb isolates in the follow-up sputum samples was not statistically significantly associated with curing or improving XDR-Acb pneumonia.In conclusion, aggressive pulmonary hygiene care, the addition of TGC, and corticosteroid dose tapering were beneficial in improving the 14-day patients' outcomes."

A retrospective cohort study.ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter species treatment often represents a challenge. The main objective of this study is identify predictors of ICU mortality in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation (MV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Patients with MV &gt; 48 h who developed a respiratory tract positive culture for Acinetobacter were included, and distinguished among colonized, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) patients. Primary outcome was ICU mortality. RESULTS: 153 patients were in MV and presented positive culture for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumanii complex, 70 of them with VAP, 59 with VAT and 24 patients were colonized. The factors related to ICU mortality were VAP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5) and shock at the time of diagnosis (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8-2.3). In multivariate analysis, only SOFA score at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was related with ICU mortality. A paired-matched analysis was performed to assess effect of dual therapy on outcomes, and no effect was found in terms of clinical cure, ICU or hospital mortality or duration of antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Previous comorbidities and degree of associated organic injury seem to be more important factors in the prognosis than double antibiotic therapy in patients with Acinetobacter-related respiratory infection."

We evaluated the frequency and resistance rates of Acb complex and S. maltophilia isolates from medical centers enrolled in the SENTRY Program. Methods: A total of 13 752 Acb complex and 6467 S. maltophilia isolates were forwarded to a monitoring laboratory by 259 participating sites from the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, Europe, and North America between 1997 and 2016. Confirmation of species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using conventional methods and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and the broth microdilution method, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted by CLSI and EUCAST 2018 criteria. Results: Acb complex and S. maltophilia were most frequently isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia (42.9% and 55.8%, respectively) and bloodstream infections (37.3% and 33.8%, respectively). Colistin and minocycline were the most active agents against Acb complex (colistin MIC50/90, &lt;=0.5/2 mg/L; 95.9% susceptible) and S. maltophilia (minocycline MIC50/90, &lt;=1/2 mg/L; 99.5% susceptible) isolates, respectively. Important temporal decreases in susceptibility rates among Acb complex isolates were observed for all antimicrobial agents in all regions. Rates of extensively drug-resistant Acb complex rates were highest in Europe (66.4%), followed by Latin America (61.5%), Asia-Pacific (56.9%), and North America (38.8%). Among S. maltophilia isolates, overall trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) susceptibility rates decreased from 97.2% in 2001-2004 to 95.7% in 2013-2016, but varied according to the geographic region. Conclusions: We observed important reductions of susceptibility rates to all antimicrobial agents among Acb complex isolates obtained from all geographic regions.

ABC strains can develop resistance to all the antibiotics available. Carbapenem resistance is common and colistin resistance is rare in our country. Knowing the risk factors for colistin resistance is important since colistin seems to be the only remaining therapeutic option for the patients with pneumonia due to extensively drug resistant ABC for our country. AIM: To investigate the comparison of clinical responses and outcomes between pneumonia patients with colistin-susceptible and -resistant Acinetobacter sp. Strains. METHODS: During the study period, 108 patients with pneumonia due to colistin-susceptible strains and 16 patients with colistin-resistant strains were included retrospectively. Continuous variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's Exact chi-square test for two groups. A binary logistic regression model was developed to identify the potential independent factors associated with colistin resistance in patients with colistin-resistant strains. RESULTS: High Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (OR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.4-2.7; P &lt; 0.001) and prior receipt of teicoplanin (OR = 8.1, 95%CI: 1.0-63.3; P = 0.045) were found to be independent risk factors for infection with colistin-resistant Acinetobacter sp. Different combinations of antibiotics including colistin, meropenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were used for the treatment of patients with colistin-resistant strains. Although the median duration of microbiological cure (P &lt; 0.001) was longer in the colistin-resistant group, clinical (P = 0.703), laboratory (P = 0.277), radiological (P = 0.551), microbiological response (P = 1.000) and infection related mortality rates (P = 0.603) did not differ between the two groups. Among the patients with infections due to colistin-resistant strains, seven were treated with antibiotic combinations that included sulbactam. Clinical (6/7) and microbiological (5/7) response rates were quite high in these patients. CONCLUSION: The optimal therapy regimen is unclear for colistin-resistant Acinetobacter sp. infections. Although combinations with sulbactam seems to be more effective in our study patients, data supporting the usefulness of combinations with sulbactam is very limited."

Source identification of the organism is often difficult. An outbreak of respiratory infection and colonization with A. anitratus affecting 93 ventilated patients in all six of a hospital's intensive care units (ICUs) over 10 months is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In April 1984, the infection control staff started to review positive culture results from all patients in all ICUs. At this point, information on significant isolates was recorded by patient, site, date, genus and species, and antimicrobial susceptibility. During the month of August 1984, an increased number of A. anitratus isolates from sputum began to be detected. Information was expanded to include the date of hospital admission, ICU admission, intubation, and extubation; the dates and types of all surgical procedures; the results and dates of all prior sputum cultures; and the use of nebulized bronchodilator medications. Monthly numbers of cases were compared for four months prior to the outbreak, during the outbreak, and for seven months after the outbreak. Plasmid DNA from isolates was prepared, electrophoresed, and visualized. Isolates were designated according to the molecular weights of visualized plasmids. RESULTS: Barrier precautions and improved staff handwashing did not diminish the frequency of new cases. When pasteurized, reusable ventilator circuits and resuscitation bags were cultured for the possibility of low-level contamination, 18 percent were positive for A. anitratus. Terminal ethylene oxide sterilization of these devices was associated with prompt control of the outbreak. Plasmid DNA analysis of isolates from patients involved in the outbreak, contaminated devices, and the hands of personnel responsible for device disinfection revealed two predominant plasmid profiles. After outbreak control, isolates with these profiles were found much less frequently in patient specimens. CONCLUSION: Contaminated, reusable ventilator support equipment may be a leading cause for the extent of A. anitratus in the sputum of intubated patients. This problem is potentially correctable by the use of terminal etyhlene oxide sterilization of reusable ventilator circuits and resuscitation bags."

Seasonal variation in the incidence of the disease is essential for clinicians and epidemiologists who deal with such diseases. The study was aimed at analysing the clinical profile and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia during different seasons of the year in a tertiary care hospital, Manmohan Memorial Teaching Hospital (MMTH), of Kathmandu, Nepal. Method The aetiology and clinical profile of 378 patients with CAP who were admitted to MMTH over a period of one year were taken into account in this retrospective cross-sectional hospital-based study. Data were retrieved from the hospital medical records section and the Department of Pathology. All patients with a primary diagnosis of CAP admitted to the hospital were included in the study. Monthly and seasonal trends, aetiology, comorbidities, and mortality rates were analysed. Results  Of 378 patients with CAP, 160 patients (42.3%) had associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 92 patients (24.3%) had hypertension (HTN), 59 patients (15.6%) had diabetes, 12 patients (3.1%) had active pulmonary tuberculosis, seven patients (1.85%) had kidney disease, and the remaining 48 patients (12.6%) had only CAP. Seasonal variation of CAP was noted in 131 patients (35%) in the winter, 98 (26%) in autumn, 86 (23%) in spring, and 63 patients (16%) in summer seasons. None of the patients were vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcus. The most common organism isolated in CAP was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii (ACB) complex (4.7%), which was more distinguished in the winter season. The second most isolated organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%). The most common clinical presentation was fever (63%), followed by cough (47%) and shortness of breath (47%). Sputum culture was found to be positive in 51 cases (13.4%). Among 378 patients, 78 patients (20.6%) received treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the rest of the patients received treatment in the general medical ward. The mortality rate was found to be 6.6%. Conclusion An incidence of sputum-positive CAP was found in 51 cases (13.4%). The most common organism was ACB complex, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were sensitive to polymyxins. Both of them were predominant in the winter and spring."

A total of 88 strains previously identified by Vitek 2 , 40 as Acinetobacter baumannii and 48 as Acb complex were isolated from 52 children from 07, January 2015 to 28, September 2017. A. baumannii accounted for 89.77% (79/88) of the strains; Acinetobacter pittii, 6.82% (6/88); and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, 3.40% (3/88). Most strains were recovered mainly from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency wards. Blood cultures (BC) provided 44.32% (39/88) of strains. The 13.63% (12/88) of strains were associated with primary bacteremia, 3.4% (3/88) with secondary bacteremia, and 2.3% (2/88) with pneumonia. In addition, 44.32% (39/88) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains and, 11.36% (10/88) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). All strains amplified the bla OXA-51 gene; 51.13% (45/88), the bla OXA-23 gene; 4.54% (4/88), the bla OXA-24 gene; and 2.27% (2/88), the bla OXA-58 gene. Plasmid profiles showed that the strains had 1-6 plasmids. The strains were distributed in 52 pulsotypes, and 24 showed identical restriction patterns, with a correlation coefficient of 1.0. Notably, some strains with the same pulsotype were isolated from different patients, wards, or years, suggesting the persistence of more than one clone. Twenty-seven sequence types (STs) were determined for the strains based on a Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme using massive sequencing; the most prevalent was ST 156 (27.27%, 24/88). The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas I-Fb system provided amplification in A. baumannii and A. pittii strains (22.73%, 20/88). This study identified an increased number of MDR strains and the relationship among strains through molecular typing. The data suggest that more than one strain could be causing an infection in some patient. The implementation of molecular epidemiology allowed the characterization of a set of strains and identification of different attributes associated with its distribution in a specific environment."

It most commonly causes nosocomial infections, particularly in elderly debilitated patients who have undergone surgery, instrumentation, and antibiotic therapy. In a study of acute pneumonia in adults, five cases of community-acquired acinetobacter pneumonia were observed over an 11-month period. Other than chronic pulmonary disease (two patients), no serious underlying diseases existed in these patients. Lobar consolidation was the predominant radiologic pattern. The mortality rate was 40%, and mortality was directly related to therapy with inappropriate antibiotics. The reason for this relatively high prevalence of community-acquired acinetobacter pneumonia in the population studied is not known. Possible explanations include the high prevalence of chronic pulmonary disease, indiscriminate use of penicillin, and an unknown immunodeficiency state."

Only those LRS positive for gram-negative bacilli were reported in this study. The patients were separated in two groups: those with nosocomial pneumonia due to gram-negative bacilli (NP+ group) and those without (NP- group). The species most often isolated from LRS were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Proteus (20%), Escherichia coli (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7%). The spectrum of gram-negative species was not statistically different in either group of patients. The numbers of gram-negative bacilli isolated from each LRS were more important in the NP+ group (p less than 0.001), but so was the duration of mechanical ventilation before each LRS (p less than 0.01). In this group also, a specific bacteriological diagnosis with only one species was possible in 3 out of the 13 cases; a tentative diagnosis only was possible in 10 cases: in 6 cases, the responsibility of two (or more) species was suggested. The susceptibility to antibiotics of gram-negative bacilli isolated from LRS was moderate. A third generation cephalosporin together with amikacin seemed to be the best choice of antibiotics when no specific bacteriological diagnosis could be made with the LRS."

In this paper we describe the course of six recent patients with community-acquired, bacteremic pneumonia due to this organism and review the six previously reported cases. Our experience suggests this organism is a more common cause of community-acquired pneumonia than previously thought. Acinetobacter pneumonia occurs in older persons with chronic disease, especially alcoholism. It is a fulminant illness with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, leukopenia and shock. Chest roentgenograms reveal a lobar or bronchopneumonic infiltrate which often becomes bilateral within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Pleural effusions are common. The mortality rate is 43 per cent. Factors that predict a fatal outcome are granulocytopenia, empyema and therapy with inappropriate antibiotics. Therapy with appropriate antibiotics, especially carbenicillin and an aminoglycoside, increases survival."

Twelve of the 13 isolates were identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus and one as var. lwoffi. In the same period there were 361 positive specimens of A. calcoaceticus. Eight of the patients were classified as having significant bacteremia (Group A) with a serious infection in which Acinetobacter was considered a significant pathogen. Five additional patients, however, (Group B) had fever and only one set of positive blood cultures. The significance of these positive isolates was unclear to the attending clinicians. All but one Group A patient appeared to have acquired their infection during hospitalization. In this group, one patient had an underlying pneumonia as the source of bacteremia. In the remaining patients bacteremia was related to some form of invasive catheterization. Seven patients responded rapidly to appropriate antimicrobial therapy and one patient with terminal cancer died as a result of infection. This report reviews the clinical spectrum of Acinetobacter bacteremia, which can range from mild, possibly self-limiting bacteremia to serious, life-threatening septicaemia, especially in compromised hospitalized patients."

Two of the men died, and postmortem examination showed mixed-dust pneumoconiosis with iron particles in the lungs. A calcoaceticus variety anitratus serotype 7J was isolated from the air in the foundry but the source was not found. The prevalence of antibody titers of 64 or greater to the 7J strain was significantly higher among foundry workers (15%) than among community controls (2%) (p less than 0.01).

Plasmid DNA analysis and analysis of genomic DNA with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to investigate possible epidemiologic relationship. All patients acquired their infections in the hospital, and no seasonal variation was observed. Among patients with A. baumannii bacteremia, 91% were hospitalized in an intensive care unit, 99% had indwelling vascular catheters, 81% received prior broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, 70% were mechanically ventilated, and 47% had major surgical procedures. In 39 cases (45%) the infection was related to indwelling vascular access devices. Other infections included pneumonia (9%), tracheobronchitis (22%), meningitis (2%), and burn wound infections (4%). Septic shock occurred in 30% of patients. All isolates were multidrug resistant. Polymicrobial bacteremia was observed in 35% of cases. The crude mortality rate was 44%. Death was considered attributable to A. baumannii bacteremia in 15 (19%) patients. All patients with pneumonia as the primary site of infection died. Using multivariate analysis, we identified 3 independent predictors of mortality: the presence of a rapidly or ultimately fatal underlying disease (p = 0.0009), septic shock at the onset of bacteremia (p = 0.0013), and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.016). Epidemiologic typing revealed that 82 episodes were associated with different hospital outbreaks of infection, and only 7 episodes were due to epidemiologically unrelated strains."

METHODS: An outbreak investigation, including detailed epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory investigation, was performed. RESULTS: A single strain of A. calcoaceticus anitratus was responsible for infection in all seven patients. All patients had tracheostomies, were in respiratory failure, and were ventilator dependent. Patients ranged in age from 27 to 81 years. No common causative variable or explanatory findings were present except that the same peak flow meter (manual weaning criteria machine) was used to facilitate weaning all seven patients from mechanical ventilation. Culture of the mouthpiece isolated a A. calcoaceticus anitratus strain with the identical susceptibility pattern and biochemical profile as that from the infected patients. CONCLUSION: A. calcoaceticus anitratus was transmitted by a peak flow meter nosocomially to seven patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Disposable mouthpieces were introduced to prevent cross-contamination. A 2% glutaraldehyde solution was used to disinfect the machine between uses.

Although the organism is widely distributed in nature, it is of relatively low virulence since colonization is more frequently noted than infection and since most infections occur in patients subjected to the epidemiologic pressures common to nosocomial, gram-negative bacillary infection: prior antibiotic therapy; instrumentation and manipulation (e.g., endotracheal intubation, urinary bladder catheterization, arterial and venous cannulation); surgery; hospitalization, especially with residence in an intensive care unit; severe underlying disease, either systemic (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy) or localized to the infected area (e.g., prior bacterial or aspirational pneumonia, trauma). Pneumonia was the most common infection due to A. calcoaceticus, and occurred only in patients with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube in place. In over half the 25 patients, more than one lobe was involved and bronchopneumonia was the usual roentgenographic appearance. Cavitation (2 patients) and empyema formation (3 patients) were uncommon. The severity of acinetobacter pneumonia is reflected in the high mortality rate (44% overall, with a 36% mortality rate due primarily to infection). Tracheobronchitis due to A. calcoaceticus was less severe than pneumonia since no patients died primarily as a result of the infection. Urinary tract infections occurred in five patients, none of whom were ill and none of whom died. Urinary bladder catheterization was thought to be responsible for infection in three patients, and in at least four of the five patients infection was restricted to the lower tract. Wound infections were noted in six patients who had undergone surgery and were related to the presence of foreign bodies in the operative site in five of the patients. Surgical debridement and/or drainage of the infected area was the primary therapeutic measure employed in most cases. Only one patient died and this was a result of noninfectious causes. Skin infection due to A. calcoaceticus was seen in two patients, one of whom exhibited fulminant, fatal cellulitis and septicemia in the setting of pancytopenia. All nine patients with acinetobacter septicemia had received antecedent antibiotic therapy, and in all cases intravenous catheters were in place at the time bacteremia occurred. Clinically, seven of the nine patients were in shock. The mortality rate was 44% overall, with a 22% mortality rate due to infection. Although septicemia was thought to be ""line-related"" in five of the nine patients, serious post-bacteremic complications developed in three patients: prosthetic valve endocarditis, suppurative thrombophlebitis and subhepatic abscess."

The study included 622 patients. Six hundred thirty-five bacterial isolates-causes of nosocomial sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs)-were tested during the study. Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant isolates, causing 65% of cases of sepsis, 78.7% of pneumonias, and 70.2% of UTIs. Gram-negative isolates (454) were highly resistant to antimicrobials commonly used in the ICU, with the exception of imipenem. Resistance was 1.1% among pathogens responsible for UTIs, 6.7% among those causing sepsis, and 13.6% among those responsible for pneumonia. Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with pneumonia and sepsis was significantly less resistant to ciprofloxacin than were isolates from urine (22.8% and 13.9%, respectively, vs 44.4%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains responsible for pneumonia were less resistant to ceftazidime than were isolates causing sepsis and UTI (35.7% vs 51.3% and 51.5%, respectively). Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains associated with UTI were significantly more resistant to netilmicin than were strains responsible for sepsis and pneumonia (83.3% vs 40.3% and 42.6%, respectively). The study confirmed that in addition to focused microbiologic surveillance, multiple-body-site monitoring can provide unique information about the sensitivity of the pathogens involved.

After detailed diagnostic work-up, community acquired Acinetobacter lwoffii pneumonia was diagnosed. The child had frequently shared respiratory equipment with elderly relatives with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As there were no other apparent risk factors, it could be assumed that the sharing of the equipment was the source of infection. The authors wish to draw attention to this possibility, that a necrotising community-acquired pneumonia due to Acinetobacter lwoffii can occur in a previously healthy child and to the dangers of inappropriate use and poor sterilisation of nebulisers.

Experimentally infected fish showed similar symptoms to those observed in fish after natural outbreaks. Susceptibility of the isolates to 14 antibiotics was tested using a disc diffusion method; all isolates were resistant to cephalothin, aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, and sensitive only to some fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines. Histological examination revealed that A. lwoffii infection could cause pathological lesions in multiple organs and tissues, especially in liver, kidney, spleen and heart. These lesions included extensive haemorrhage, vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration.

A. baumannii isolates were resistant to more classes of antimicrobials, except colistin, and therefore the patients with A. baumannii pneumonia were more likely to receive inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. The 14-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with A. baumannii pneumonia (34.7% vs. 15.3%, p 0.001). A. baumannii was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.05-3.90; p 0.035) in the overall cohort after adjustment for other risk factors for death, including inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. The results demonstrated the difference in clinical presentation, microbial characteristics and outcomes between A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis nosocomial pneumonia, and supported that they are two distinct clinical entities."

Understanding the risk factors related to INS infection is useful for infection control. The risk factors for INS A. baumannii have been well documented; however, the risk factors related to INS Acinetobacter nosocomialis infection lack documentation. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with INS A. nosocomialis bacteremia. METHODS: This retrospective 9-year study included 329 adults with A. nosocomialis bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. Acinetobacter nosocomialis was identified using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method and sequence analysis of a 16S-23S intergenic spacer. RESULTS: Among 329 patients with A. nosocomialis bacteremia, 67 had INS isolates (20.4%). Patients with INS isolates tended to have a more severe form of the diseases [with ICU admission and a higher APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score], specific underlying diseases (associated with chronic lung diseases and end-stage renal diseases, but less commonly alcoholism and chemotherapy), multiple invasive procedures, pneumonia as a primary focus of infection, and prior antimicrobial use (sulbactam, antipseudomonal penicillins, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems). Multivariable analysis showed that ICU admission, chronic lung diseases, arterial line catheterization, total parenteral nutrition, and prior use of carbapenems were independent risk factors; prior use of carbapenems was found to be the most influential (odds ratio 6.36, 95% confidence interval 2.00-20.21; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the risk factors associated with INS A. nosocomialis bacteremia. Regulated antibiotic control policy, especially for carbapenem, and infection control measures targeting patients hospitalized in ICU, with chronic lung diseases and multiple invasive procedures, may be helpful in reducing INS A. nosocomialis infection."

Previous small case series have suggested fulminant disease and a pooled hospital mortality of &gt; 60%. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of all episodes of bacteremic, community-onset, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia due to Acinetobacter species at a tertiary referral hospital in tropical Australia from 1997 to 2012 following the introduction of routine empirical treatment protocols covering Acinetobacter. Demographic, clinical, microbiologic, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: There were 41 episodes of bacteremic community-onset Acinetobacter pneumonia, of which 36 had no indicators suggesting health-care-associated infection. Of these, 38 (93%) were Indigenous Australians, one-half were men, the average age was 44.1 years, and 36 episodes (88%) occurred during the rainy season. All patients had at least one risk factor, with hazardous alcohol intake in 82%. Of the 37 isolates available for molecular speciation, 35 were Acinetobacter baumannii and two were Acinetobacter nosocomialis. All isolates were susceptible in vitro to gentamicin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin, but only one was fully susceptible to ceftriaxone. ICU admission was required in 80%. All 41 patients received appropriate antibiotics within the first 24 h of admission, and 28- and 90-day mortality were both low at 11%. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired Acinetobacter pneumonia is a severe disease, with the majority of patients requiring ICU admission. Most patients have risk factors, particularly hazardous alcohol use. Despite this severity, correct initial empirical antibiotic therapy in all patients was associated with low mortality."

Previous exposure to colistin has been shown to be associated with the emergence of colistin resistance, but may be not the only predisposing factor. In the current study, we highlight the risk and outcome of patients without previous exposure to colistin who acquired colistin-resistant Acinetobacter nosocomialis (ColRAN) bacteraemia. This 11-year single-centre retrospective study analysed 58 patients with ColRAN bacteraemia and 213 patients with colistin-susceptible A. nosocomialis (ColSAN) bacteraemia. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined with an agar dilution method. The clonal relationship of ColRAN isolates was determined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A conjugation mating-out assay was conducted to delineate the potential transfer of colistin resistance genes. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for ColRAN bacteraemia. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was independently associated with ColRAN bacteraemia (OR 3.04; 95% CI 1.45-6.37; p 0.003). Patients with ColRAN bacteraemia had higher APACHE II scores, but the two groups showed no significant differences in 14-day mortality (10.3% vs. 10.3%) or 28-day mortality (15.5% vs. 15.0%). ColRAN isolates had greater resistance than ColSAN isolates to all antimicrobial agents except for ciprofloxacin (0% vs. 6.6%). There were 16 different ColRAN pulsotypes, and two major clones were found. Colistin resistance did not transfer to colistin-susceptible A. baumannii or A. nosocomialis. These results show that COPD is an independent risk factor for acquisition of ColRAN bacteraemia. The mortality rates were similar between patients with ColRAN and ColSAN bacteraemia."

We investigated the clinical and molecular characteristics of A. seifertii. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 80 adults with A. seifertii bloodstream infection (BSI) at four medical centres over an 8 year period. Species identification was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, rpoB sequencing and WGS. Molecular typing was performed by MLST. Clinical information, antimicrobial susceptibility and the mechanisms of carbapenem and colistin resistance were analysed. Transmissibility of the carbapenem-resistance determinants was examined by conjugation experiments. RESULTS: The main source of A. seifertii BSI was the respiratory tract (46.3%). The 28 day and in-hospital mortality rates of A. seifertii BSI were 18.8% and 30.0%, respectively. High APACHE II scores and immunosuppressant therapy were independent risk factors for 28 day mortality. The most common MLST type was ST553 (58.8%). Most A. seifertii isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin (86.2%), and only 37.5% were susceptible to colistin. Carbapenem resistance was observed in 16.3% of isolates, mostly caused by the plasmid-borne ISAba1-blaOXA-51-like genetic structure. A. seifertii could transfer various carbapenem-resistance determinants to A. baumannii, Acinetobacter nosocomialis and other A. seifertii isolates. Variations of pmrCAB and lpxCAD genes were not associated with colistin resistance of A. seifertii. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin and carbapenems, but not colistin, have the potential to be the drug of choice for A. seifertii infections. A. seifertii can transfer carbapenem-resistance determinants to other species of the A. baumannii group and warrants close monitoring."

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of isolation of the species that constitute the Acb complex, as well as their susceptibility to antibiotics, and their distribution at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). A total of 88 strains previously identified by Vitek 2 , 40 as Acinetobacter baumannii and 48 as Acb complex were isolated from 52 children from 07, January 2015 to 28, September 2017. A. baumannii accounted for 89.77% (79/88) of the strains; Acinetobacter pittii, 6.82% (6/88); and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, 3.40% (3/88). Most strains were recovered mainly from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency wards. Blood cultures (BC) provided 44.32% (39/88) of strains. The 13.63% (12/88) of strains were associated with primary bacteremia, 3.4% (3/88) with secondary bacteremia, and 2.3% (2/88) with pneumonia. In addition, 44.32% (39/88) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains and, 11.36% (10/88) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). All strains amplified the bla OXA-51 gene; 51.13% (45/88), the bla OXA-23 gene; 4.54% (4/88), the bla OXA-24 gene; and 2.27% (2/88), the bla OXA-58 gene. Plasmid profiles showed that the strains had 1-6 plasmids. The strains were distributed in 52 pulsotypes, and 24 showed identical restriction patterns, with a correlation coefficient of 1.0. Notably, some strains with the same pulsotype were isolated from different patients, wards, or years, suggesting the persistence of more than one clone. Twenty-seven sequence types (STs) were determined for the strains based on a Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme using massive sequencing; the most prevalent was ST 156 (27.27%, 24/88). The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas I-Fb system provided amplification in A. baumannii and A. pittii strains (22.73%, 20/88). This study identified an increased number of MDR strains and the relationship among strains through molecular typing. The data suggest that more than one strain could be causing an infection in some patient. The implementation of molecular epidemiology allowed the characterization of a set of strains and identification of different attributes associated with its distribution in a specific environment."

In this study, we describe the clinical course and outcome of patients with A. actinomycetemcomitans infection. METHODS: All patients suffering invasive A. actinomycetemcomitans infections at the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1985 to December 2004 were included in this study. Relevant data regarding clinical presentation, antimicrobial treatment and outcome of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 11 patients with invasive A. actinomycetemcomitans infections, including eight patients with infective endocarditis, one with osteonecrosis and two with pneumonia and chest wall lesions. Among the patients with infective endocarditis, four had prosthetic valve replacement, four suffered from rheumatic heart disease and one had undergone surgical repair of ventricular septal defect. Lesions in the oral cavity were the probable portals of entry of the microorganism, and included carious teeth, periodontitis or radiotherapy of the ear-nose-throat field, and were noted in nine patients. Transthoracic echocardiography and/or transesophageal echocardiography were performed on the patients with probable infective endocarditis but growth was demonstrated in only four of these patients. Blood culture yielded A. actinomycetemcomitans after prolonged incubation. Three isolates were resistant to penicillin and two of these were also resistant to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of invasive A. actinomycetemcomitans infection was delayed due to the indolent clinical course, non-specific presentation and slow growth of the organism. Antibiotic therapy using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin was successful in all patients.

DESIGN: Retrospective study of clinical cases. METHODS: Breed, age and gender of horse, history, physical examination findings, treatment and outcome were determined from the hospital records of 51 horses in which a diagnosis of peritonitis attributed to A. equuli was made between January 1993 and June 1999. Results of abdominal fluid cytology and bacteriology, antimicrobial sensitivity patterns, haematology and faecal egg counts, when performed, were also retrieved. RESULTS: There was a variety of breeds of horses affected. There were 35 male and 17 female horses, aged from 9 months to 22 years, presented. Lethargy, signs of depression with mild to moderate signs of abdominal pain and inappetence were the most common reasons for presentation. Most horses had elevated heart and respiratory rates, an elevated rectal temperature and reduced intestinal borborygmi heard on auscultation of the abdomen. Abnormal colour with an elevated protein were features of an abdominal fluid sample in 98% of horses and a marked elevation in nucleated cell count was present in all samples. Pleomorphic gram-negative rods were seen on cytology in 53% of samples and a positive culture of A. equuli was returned in 72% of samples. Other laboratory findings in some horses included mild haemoconcentration, hypoproteinaemia, an elevated circulating nucleated cell count with a left shift, an elevation in fibrinogen concentration and an elevated faecal egg count. All horses demonstrated a rapid response to treatment with procaine penicillin alone, or a combination of procaine penicillin and gentamicin sulphate. Where antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed, all but two isolates were sensitive to procaine penicillin. All horses responded to antimicrobial and supportive therapy and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: Horses with A. equuli peritonitis present with similar clinical signs as horses with other causes of abdominal pain. However, these signs, when evaluated in conjunction with the results of abdominal fluid analysis and response to treatment, are characteristic of A. equuli peritonitis. Pleomorphic gram-negative bacteria may be seen on a cytological preparation of the abdominal fluid sample, and a positive bacterial culture may be obtained in some, but not all, cases. Most isolates are sensitive to procaine penicillin, so treatment with procaine penicillin and gentamicin sulphate is recommended until antimicrobial sensitivity is known."

Significant macroscopic abnormalities at postmortem examination were restricted to the respiratory system, and microscopically, severe pulmonary hemorrhage with suppurative bronchopneumonia was found. Actinobacillus equuli subsp. haemolyticus was cultured from a transtracheal wash performed antemortem as well as from the lungs at necropsy. The presence of airway-associated hemorrhage in conjunction with bacterial bronchopneumonia suggested endothelial damage caused by a locally elaborated bacterial toxin, possibly produced by the A. equuli strain isolated from the lungs. The objective of this report was to indirectly document the presence of hemolysin repeat in structural toxin (RTX) in the lungs of the reported mare. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the recently described aqx gene of A. equuli subsp. haemolyticus was established and validated. Transcriptional activity of the aqx gene was used as a surrogate method to document toxin production. Real-time PCR analysis of the transtracheal fluid and lung tissue of the affected mare confirmed the presence and the transcriptional activity of the aqx gene at the genomic (gDNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA) levels, respectively.

Clinical history, signs, bacterial species isolated, and associated lesions were documented. Actinobacillus spp. were isolated 111 times. The most common isolates were Actinobacillus equuli subsp. equuli (38.7%) and hemolytic Actinobacillus spp. (24.3%). Other isolates were Actinobacillus lignieresii (5.4%), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (1.8%), and unclassified Actinobacillus spp. (28.8%).

Predisposing factors such as failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies as well as concurrent pathogenic bacterial or viral infections were present in numerous actinobacillosis cases. There were many cases, however, for which a predisposing factor or concurrent infection was not documented or apparent, suggesting that Actinobacillus spp. can be primary pathogens under the right circumstances and in the right location."

Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an approximately 8-mm filamentous image with chaotic motion in the ventricular face of the anterior mitral valve leaflet compatible with vegetation. Treatment with ceftriaxone and gentamicin was initiated. Haemophilus parainfluenzae grew in five blood culture samples. Along the hospital stay, the patient's level of consciousness decreased, and she was diagnosed with ischemic stroke of cardioembolic etiology.

It has previously been associated with respiratory tract infections and bacteraemia in debilitated patients. However, under-reporting may occur due to misidentification by commonly used laboratory bacterial identification systems. This case is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of A. hominis osteomyelitis in the English language medical literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old male presented with a painful foot. He had no previous foot problems, history of injury or animal contact. Osteomyelitis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood cultures were positive for Gram-variable bacilli. The organism was identified initially as Pasteurella pneumotropica by the local routine diagnostic laboratory and as a Pasteurella species by the UK National Reference Laboratory (Colindale, London, UK), using standard operating procedures at the time. It was finally identified as an A. hominis using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Difficulties in the accurate identification of this organism remain current, as other biochemical identification systems have also resulted in misidentifications. The patient refused admission and intravenous antibiotics. He was successfully treated using an 8-week course of oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin based on antibiotic disc susceptibility testing resulting in clinical, serological and radiological resolution. CONCLUSION: Laboratories should maintain a high index of suspicion for A. hominis as several commonly used bacterial identification systems may not accurately identify the organism. Colonial morphology and absence of animal contact should prompt consideration of this organism in appropriate clinical situations. Oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin treatment was successful in this case."

Cardiobacterium hominis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus species usually seed previously damaged cardiac valves presumably during bacteremia from an upper respiratory site. The clinical presentation resembles that of Streptococcus viridans endocarditis and is usually subacute or chronic. Despite bacteriologic cure, severe CHF and/or systemic embolization frequently develops during or following the course of antibiotics, resulting in significant morbidity and a high mortality rate. This report of nine cases diagnosed at five hospitals in a 7-year period suggests that endocarditis due to these organisms is more common than previously appreciated and frequently goes unrecognized. This is probably due to a lack of attention to the requirements for culture of this group of bacteria with propensity for granular growth in broth. We have proposed specific cultural techniques appropriate to the search for these organisms in patients with apparent culture-negative endocarditis."

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 21 horses. RESULTS: 19 of the 21 horses were Thoroughbred racehorses in training. Eighteen horses had had strenuous exercise immediately prior to onset of illness. Fifteen horses had a serosanguineous nasal discharge during hospitalization. Seventeen horses had radiographic evidence of pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion. Nine of 14 horses had ultrasonographic evidence of large pulmonary parenchymal defects consistent with consolidation. Pleurocentesis yielded a suppurative, serosanguineous effusion in the 14 horses in which it was performed. Bacteria were isolated from all transtracheal aspirates (14) and from 6 of 12 pleural fluid samples. Actinobacillus suis-like organisms and Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus were most commonly isolated. Nineteen horses were hospitalized and treated. Mean duration of treatment was 5 days, and most horses were euthanatized because of secondary complications, continued costs of medical treatment, or poor prognosis for future performance. Pathologic lesions included well-demarcated regions of hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction with necrosis and a serosanguineous pleural effusion. Thrombosis of pulmonary vessels was found in 11 horses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An acute or peracute onset of severe respiratory distress, with serosanguineous nasal discharge, ultrasonographic and radiographic evidence of severe pulmonary consolidation, and serosanguineous suppurative pleural effusion, is strongly suggestive of pulmonary infarction in horses. Horses with pulmonary infarction responded poorly to conventional treatment for pleuropneumonia and had a poor prognosis for recovery."

The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 84 patients with pneumonia due to Aeromonas species, possible Aeromonas pneumonia was diagnosed in 58 patients, probable Aeromonas pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 patients, and pneumonia due to Aeromonas was conclusively diagnosed in 8 patients. Most of the cases of Aeromonas pneumonia developed in men and in patients of advanced age. A. hydrophila (n = 50, 59.5 %) was the most common pathogen, followed by A. caviae (n = 24, 28.6 %), A. veronii biovar sobria (n = 7, 8.3 %), and A. veronii biovar veronii (n = 3, 3.6 %). Cancer (n = 37, 44.0 %) was the most common underlying disease, followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 27, 32.1 %). Drowning-associated pneumonia developed in 6 (7.1 %) patients. Of 47 patients who were admitted to the intensive care ward, 42 patients developed acute respiratory failure and 24 of those patients died. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was significantly associated with liver cirrhosis, cancer, initial presentation of shock, and usage of mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, Aeromonas species should be considered as one of the causative pathogens of severe pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised patients, and should be recognized as a cause of drowning-associated pneumonia. Cirrhosis, cancer, and shock as the initial presenting symptom are associated with poor outcome. "

The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients with bacteremia due to Aeromonas species were identified. In addition to 16 (17.6%) primary bacteremia, the most common source of secondary infection is peritonitis (n = 27, 29.7%), followed by biliary tract infection (n = 18, 19.8%), and SSTI (n = 12, 13.2%), pneumonia (n = 9, 9.9%), catheter-related bloodstream infection (n =  5, 5.5%), and genitourinary tract infection (n = 4, 4.4%).

Although it is rarely cited as a cause of pneumonitis, we have been able to collect epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiologic data on eight patients who have had evidence of Aeromonas pneumonia. Interestingly, seven of the eight patients were male, and the average age for the group was 54.3 years. In contrast to reports showing a prevalence of other types of A hydrophila infections during the summer months, five of the pneumonitis cases occurred during late fall and early winter. Infections were both community-acquired and nosocomial. A proven or suspected history of aspiration was present in six patients. Preexisting medical conditions were noted in all patients, the majority having multiple predisposing factors, which included alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Three patients died of their acute pulmonary infection. Based on in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, aminoglycoside therapy would seem appropriate in the treatment of these infections."

The evolution was characterized by the development of a multifactorial ARDS (secondary drowning) and sepsis caused by Aeromonas hydrophila and Acinetobacter anitratum. Fibrosing alveolitis caused a restrictive syndrome with severe mechanical impairment and transitory therapy-resistant hypoxemia. It is suggested that prolonged submersion in cold water is also a treatable and completely reversible condition in adults. In our patient without neurological sequelae the pulmonary function studies after 3 months show complete recovery from the mechanical impairment.

We have recently treated three patients for severe A hydrophila pneumonia and sepsis. Two of these patients were healthy young men who aspirated the organism from contaminated water associated with near drowning. One patient survived severe ARDS and gram-negative sepsis.

The usual resuscitative measures were undertaken, together with administration of adrenaline and gastric lavage. Six hours of external cardiac massage and pacing, and high catecholamine doses (36 mg.h-1 of adrenaline and 60 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1 of dobutamine) were required before the circulatory system became again spontaneously efficient. After this acute episode, the patient improved despite acute tubular necrosis. On the third day, bilateral alveolar and interstitial lesions were found on the chest film. Bronchoalveolar lavage and protected distal brushings were carried out. Both Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus aureus were found in the cultured brushings. Treatment with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and amikacin was introduced. This nosocomial pneumonia was very haemorrhagic, resulting in several bloody casts responsible for several episodes of atelectasis. The patient was definitely extubated on the 18th day, and left the ICU 23 days later without any sequela. His HIV status was negative. Four other infections with the same strain of Aeromonas hydrophila occurred at the same time as this patient's. The common source for this germ was found to be soft water. Several measures have since been undertaken: removal of a centralized water softener, filtration and higher chlorine content in the water circuit, and updating of intensive care protocols for disinfection of equipment."

The subsequent serological survey carried out on samples collected between June 2012 and September 2013 from 92 poultry flocks detected positive sera in two additional meat turkey flocks located in the same province. The analysis of amino acids in the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins revealed that the detected H9N2 viruses possessed molecular profiles suggestive of low pathogenicity, avian-like SAalpha2,3 receptor specificity and adaptation to domestic poultry. Phylogenetic studies showed that these H9N2 AIVs grouped within the Eurasian clade of wild bird-origin AIVs and had no relationship with H9N2 AIV circulating in poultry in the Middle East and Far East Asia over the past decade. Experimentally infected SPF chickens with the index-case H9N2 virus remained healthy throughout the experiment. On the other hand, ten 3-week-old commercial turkeys infected via the oculonasal route showed respiratory signs and mortality (2/10 birds). Additional diagnostic tests demonstrated the consistent presence of DNA/RNA of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, Bordetella avium and, less frequently, of astro-, rota-, reo-, parvo- and adenoviruses in turkeys both from field outbreaks and laboratory experiment. Although no microbiological culture was performed, we speculate that these secondary pathogens could play a role in the pathogenicity of the current H9N2 infections. "

A case of cavitary pneumonia caused by B. bronchiseptica in an AIDS patient is presented, and the basis of the seemingly enhanced pathogenic potential of this isolate (designated 814) is investigated. B. bronchiseptica was the only microorganism recovered from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and samples taken through the protected brush catheter. Unlike previous work reporting the involvement of B. bronchiseptica in cases of pneumonia, antibiotic treatment selected on the basis of in vitro antibacterial activity resulted in clearance of the infection and resolution of the pulmonary infiltrate. Although isolate 814 produced reduced amounts of several major antigens including at least one Bvg-activated factor (pertactin), the molecular basis of this deficiency was found to be BvgAS independent since the defect persisted after the bvgAS locus of isolate 814 was replaced with a wild-type bvgAS allele. Despite its prominent phenotype, isolate 814 displayed only a modest yet a significant deficiency in its ability to colonize the respiratory tracts of immunocompetent rats at an early time point. Interestingly, the antibody response elicited by isolate 814 in these animals was almost undetectable. We propose that isolate 814 may be more virulent in immunocompromised patients due, at least in part, to its innate ability to produce low amounts of immunogenic factors which may be required at only normal levels for the interaction of this pathogen with its immunocompetent natural hosts."

While it is common for health care providers to ask about exposure to ill family/friends, most do not routinely inquire about the health or immunization status of household pets. We report two cases of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia in lung transplant recipients [cystic fibrosis (CF); ages 10 and 15 yr; one male] who contracted B. bronchiseptica from pet dogs. We compared their course and outcome to four children (two CF, one congenital heart disease and one Duchenne's muscular dystrophy; four males, age range 6 months to 14 yr) with B. bronchiseptica cultured from the respiratory tract. Two of the four patients also acquired their illnesses from pet dogs and two from unknown sources. One lung transplant recipient expired from progressive respiratory failure. We conclude that B. bronchiseptica can cause serious infections in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent children. We speculate that a detailed history of exposure to ill pets (particularly dogs), and the immunization status of all pets should be included in the routine evaluation of all pediatric transplant recipients."

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 65 dogs. PROCEDURES: Dogs were considered to have community-acquired infectious pneumonia if they had clinical signs of primary respiratory tract disease in conjunction with radiographic evidence of alveolar disease and positive results following bacterial culture of tracheal wash fluid. RESULTS: Most dogs were hypoxemic at the time of initial examination, with pulmonary function becoming worse during the first few days of hospitalization before improving; 57 (88%) dogs survived to discharge. Bordetella bronchiseptica was isolated from tracheal wash fluid from 32 (49%) dogs, and other organisms, predominantly gram-negative enteric bacteria, were isolated from the other 33 (51%). Dogs with Bordetella pneumonia were significantly younger (median, 14 vs 21 weeks), were significantly more likely to have been obtained from a pet store (19/31 vs 7/32), had been owned for a significantly shorter time prior to the onset of illness (median, 18 vs 90 days), had significantly higher PvCO2 values at initial examination (median, 48.7 vs 41.3 mm Hg), were significantly more likely to receive supplemental oxygen (25/32 vs 16/33), and had significantly longer hospitalization times (mean, 7.2 vs 4.9 days) than did dogs with pneumonia caused by any other organism.

ABCD guidelines on prevention and management.ABSTRACT:OVERVIEW: Bordetella bronchiseptica is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonises the respiratory tract of mammals and is considered to be a primary pathogen of domestic cats. It is sensible to consider B bronchiseptica as a rare cause of zoonotic infections. The bacterium is susceptible to common disinfectants. INFECTION: The bacterium is shed in oral and nasal secretions of infected cats. Dogs with respiratory disease are an infection risk for cats. The microorganism colonises the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract of the host, establishing chronic infections. DISEASE SIGNS: A wide range of respiratory signs has been associated with B bronchiseptica infection, from a mild illness with fever, coughing, sneezing, ocular discharge and lymphadenopathy to severe pneumonia with dyspnoea, cyanosis and death. DIAGNOSIS: Bacterial culture and PCR lack sensitivity. Samples for isolation can be obtained from the oropharynx (swabs) or via transtracheal wash/ bronchoalveolar lavage. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: Antibacterial therapy is indicated, even if the signs are mild. Where sensitivity data are unavailable, tetracyclines are recommended. Doxycycline is the antimicrobial of choice. Cats with severe B bronchiseptica infection require supportive therapy and intensive nursing care. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS: In some European countries an intranasal modified-live virus vaccine is available. The modified-live product is licensed for use as a single vaccination with annual boosters.

A 61-year-old female underwent a kidney-pancreas transplant 7 years before presentation. Postoperative immunosuppression was achieved with sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was doing well until she developed a small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions. She underwent surgical adhesiolysis without complications. Two weeks postoperatively the patient developed pneumonia. She failed to respond to repeated courses of antibiotics, and thus, diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. BAL cultures grew B. bronchiseptica. Further investigation revealed that the patient's dogs had recently received a live-attenuated B. bronchiseptica intranasal vaccination. The patient recovered after 21 days of therapy with doxycycline based upon in vitro susceptibility testing. B. bronchiseptica is an uncommon but recognized human pathogen. It most commonly affects immunocompromised individuals. Here, we report a culture-proven case of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia in an immunocompromised host residing in a household with her dogs who had recently received live-attenuated, intranasal B. bronchiseptica vaccinations. As polymerase chain reaction testing was not performed comparing the isolated strain to the vaccination strain, the association is presumptive. This report expands the spectrum of immunocompromised hosts to include renal-pancreas transplant patients who have developed infection from B. bronchiseptica, while illustrating the risks associated with animal contacts and attenuated vaccines in the immunosuppressed population."

Few cases have been reported in the medical literature where Bordetella bronchiseptica has been the only pathogen isolated during a course of interstitial pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old African-American man with human immunodeficiency virus presented with pulmonary symptoms that mimicked Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. A sputum culture grew Bordetella brochiseptica, a common respiratory commensal of wild and domestic animals, rarely implicated in human infections. CONCLUSION: Bordetella bronchiseptica should be added to the differential list of pathogens which can affect people with human immunodeficiency virus and pulmonary symptoms. Sputum culture, as well as history of animal exposure, in these patients is advised."

A recent phylogenetic analysis distinguished two distinct B. bronchiseptica subpopulations, designated complexes I and IV. Complex IV isolates appear to have a bias for infecting humans; however, little is known regarding their epidemiology, virulence properties, or comparative genomics. RESULTS: Here we report a characterization of the virulence of human-associated complex IV B. bronchiseptica strains. In in vitro cytotoxicity assays, complex IV strains showed increased cytotoxicity in comparison to a panel of complex I strains. Some complex IV isolates were remarkably cytotoxic, resulting in LDH release levels in A549 cells that were 10- to 20-fold greater than complex I strains. In vivo, a subset of complex IV strains was found to be hypervirulent, with an increased ability to cause lethal pulmonary infections in mice. Hypercytotoxicity in vitro and hypervirulence in vivo were both dependent on the activity of the bsc T3SS and the BteA effector. To clarify differences between lineages, representative complex IV isolates were sequenced and their genomes were compared to complex I isolates. Although our analysis showed there were no genomic sequences that can be considered unique to complex IV strains, there were several loci that were predominantly found in complex IV isolates. CONCLUSION: Our observations reveal a T3SS-dependent hypervirulence phenotype in human-associated complex IV isolates, highlighting the need for further studies on the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of this B. bronchiseptica lineage."

In archived formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded lung samples from 68 cases with the clinical and histologic diagnosis of pneumonia the histological pattern of pneumonia was re-evaluated and the samples were further investigated for the following infectious agents: canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Bordetella (B.) bronchiseptica, Pasteurella (P.) multocida, Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis spp. In 47.1% of the samples at least one of the featured respiratory pathogens was detected. In 31.3% of these positive samples more than one pathogen could be found. The correct detection of CDV had been achieved in ten out of eleven positive cases (90.9%) upon initial investigation, but the presence of bacterial pathogens, like B. bronchiseptica (10 cases) and P. multocida (17 cases) had been missed in all but one case. While CDV and CRCoV infections were exclusively found in dogs younger than one year, the vast majority of infections with P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica were both common either in dogs younger than 4 months or older than one year. Thus, this retrospective approach yielded valuable data on the presence, absence and prevalence of certain respiratory pathogens in dogs with pneumonia."

Our study evaluated histologic identification of cilia-associated bacteria as a method for diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. Cases of fatal bronchopneumonia were studied retrospectively, excluding neonates and cases of aspiration pneumonia, minor lung lesions, or autolysis. The study population comprised 36 canine and 31 feline cases of bronchopneumonia. B. bronchiseptica was identified in 8 of 36 canine and 14 of 31 feline cases based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) using serum from a rabbit hyperimmunized with pertactin, PCR testing (Fla2/Fla12), and/or bacterial culture data when available. Of these, IHC was positive in 4 canine and 7 feline cases, PCR was positive in 8 canine and 14 feline cases, and B. bronchiseptica was isolated in 2 of 5 canine and 3 of 9 feline cases tested. Examination of histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed bronchial cilia-associated bacteria in 4 of 36 canine and 5 of 31 feline cases; these were all positive by IHC and PCR. The presence of cilia-associated bacteria had been noted in the pathology report for only 2 of these 9 cases. Thus, the presence of cilia-associated bacteria seems frequently overlooked by pathologists, but is a diagnostically significant feature of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. A specific diagnosis of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia is important because it suggests primary or opportunistic bacterial pneumonia rather than aspiration pneumonia, and because of the risk of animal-to-animal transmission of B. bronchiseptica, the availability of vaccines for disease prevention, and the potential zoonotic risk to immunocompromised pet owners.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective monocentric study of all hospitalized patients over the past 15 years with a positive test to B. bronchiseptica. RESULTS: Nine patients were included between 2001 and 2015; two presented with infectious relapses, i.e. a total of 14 positive test samples were observed. Age, induced immunodeficiency, and preexisting respiratory illnesses are risk factors. All patients showed symptoms at sample collection and the infection was exclusively respiratory. The diagnosis was obtained through a cytobacteriological test of sputum, bronchial aspiration, or bronchial fibroscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage. The drug susceptibility test revealed a natural resistance to cephalosporins including ceftazidime, monobactam, and fosfomycin. There were cases of resistance to penicillin A and to the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole association. The classically used antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia is based on probability and may thus fail. Four patients died. The duration and nature of the antibiotics to use have not been codified. CONCLUSION: B. bronchiseptica infection mainly affects the elderly. All patients should be treated, regardless of the importance of the inoculum, and all infected animals should be treated."

There is limited information regarding the prevalence of pathogens related to CIRD in the United States as well as the role of co-infections in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive etiologic and epidemiologic study of multiple CIRD agents in a diverse dog population using molecular methods and statistical modeling analyses. In addition, a novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate two species of Mycoplasma (M. canis and M. cynos). Canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, influenza A virus (H3N2 and H3N8), Bordetella bronchiseptica, M. canis, M. cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were investigated in specimens from clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs received at the Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Results showed low occurrence of classical CIRD agents such as B. bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus and distemper virus, while highlighting the potential role of emerging bacteria such as M. canis and M. cynos. Statistical modeling analyses of CIRD pathogens emphasized the impact of co-infections on the severity of clinical presentation, and showed that host factors, such as animal age, are the most important predictors of disease severity. This study provides new insights into the current understanding of the prevalence and role of co-infections with selected viruses and bacteria in the etiology of CIRD, while underscoring the importance of molecular diagnosis and vaccination against this disease."

","SPECIES:Bordetella bronchisepticaID:32087347TITLE:Comparative genomic analysis of Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates from the lungs of pigs with porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC).ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica), as an opportunistic pathogen, can cause respiratory diseases in a variety of animals, including humans. In additional to being involved in porcine atrophic rhinitis through coinfection with Pasteurella multocida, B. bronchiseptica is associated with porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). While there are genomic data available from different host species, little is known about B. bronchiseptica isolates from pig lungs, especially from lungs characterized as having PRDC. RESULTS: A total of five B. bronchiseptica isolates were identified from pig lungs characterized as PRDC. The draft genomes of these strains were generated. In comparison with the other reported genomes, these five isolates showed the similar general characteristic including G+C content, rRNAs/tRNA, and clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs). Phylogenetic analysis of all B. Bronchiseptica isolates of different species available at GenBank based on core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) classified them into two genogroups. All five isolates from this study, with the other isolates from pigs, were placed into a subclade of genogroup I consisting of only mammalian isolates. By contrast, genogroup II contained the isolates from an avian species (turkey) and some mammals (human and dog). Moreover, genome annotation revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes among these five genomes, consistent with the similarity and variety in genomic traits. Finally, comparative analysis of insertion sequence (IS) and prophages in five genomes further showed the similarity and variety in genomic characteristic. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide comparative genomics of B. bronchiseptica strains from pig lungs characterized as having PRDC. Importantly, the findings presented in this study reveal novel genomic characteristic of B. bronchiseptica, which should provide insightful information on genome evolution."

Nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs were collected from asymptomatic dogs and those with CIRD, living in private house or in kennels. PCR-based examination was conducted for detecting nine pathogens. Among private household dogs, 50.8% with CIRD, 11.1% with respiratory disease other than CIRD, and 4.3% asymptomatic were positive for more than one pathogen, whereas in kennel-housed dogs, 42.9% with CIRD and 27.3% asymptomatic were positive. Bordetella bronchiseptica was most frequently detected, followed by canine herpesvirus 1, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, Mycoplasma cynos, and canine adenovirus type 2.

Gentamicin delivered by aerosol maximizes local drug delivery without systemic absorption but clinical response to protocols remains undetermined. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical response to 2 protocols of aerosolized delivery of gentamicin in bordetellosis. ANIMALS: Forty-six dogs with Bb infection confirmed by culture or quantitative polymerase chain reaction on bronchoalveolar lavage. METHODS: Retrospective study. Administration of aerosolized gentamicin for >=10 minutes q12h for >=3 weeks using 4 mg/kg diluted with saline (group 1) or undiluted 5% solution (group 2). Clinical response firstly assessed after 3-4 weeks and treatment pursued by 3-weeks increments if cure not reached. Cure defined as absence of cough persisting at least a week after treatment interruption. RESULTS: Demographic data were similar between both groups. Clinical cure at 3-4 weeks was more frequently observed with the use of undiluted solution (19/33 vs 3/13 dogs, P = .03) in association with a shorter median duration of treatment (4 vs 6 weeks, P = .01). Dogs from group 2 having less than 1000 cells/muL in lavage were also more likely to be cured at 3-4 weeks than dogs with more than 1000 cells/muL [9/9 vs 10/19, P = .006] and median duration of treatment in that subgroup of animals was reduced (3 vs 5 weeks, P = .02). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Aerosolized delivery of gentamicin seems effective for inducing clinical cure in Bb infection. Clinical response appears better using undiluted 5% solution, particularly in the subgroup of dogs having less than 1000 cells/muL in lavage."

In humans, B. bronchiseptica commonly leads to respiratory infections like pneumonia or bronchitis, and animal contact usually precedes the onset of symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of post-traumatic B. bronchiseptica meningitis without recent surgery in the setting of immunosuppression with a monoclonal antibody. Our case concerns a 77-year-old male with ulcerative colitis on infliximab who sustained a mechanical fall and developed a traumatic cerebrospinal fluid leak complicated by meningitis. He received meropenem then ceftazidime during his hospital course, and temporary neurosurgical drain placement was required. His clinical condition improved, and he was discharged at his baseline neurological status. CONCLUSIONS: B. bronchiseptica is an unusual cause of meningitis that may warrant consideration in immunocompromised hosts with known or suspected animal exposures. To better characterize this rare cause of meningitis, we performed a systematic literature review and summarized all previously reported cases."

Two real-time fluorescent resonance energy transfer hybridization probe LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) PCR assays were used. One (designed in-house) targeted the pertussis toxin S1 promoter (ptxA-pr), and included an internal process control to test for sample inhibition and reagent performance. The other (already published) targeted the insertion element IS481. The analytical sensitivities of the assays were 100 and 10 fg per reaction for the ptxA-pr and IS481 PCRs, respectively. The ptxA-pr assay was specific for B. pertussis, whilst the IS481 PCR also showed some cross-reactivity with Bordetella holmesii and the type strain of Bordetella parapertussis. From April 2002 to March 2007, 848 samples were received from 774 patients and DNA was extracted. Of 824 samples that were suitable for testing, 183 (22.2 %) had evidence of Bordetella infection (18.9 % ptxA-pr and IS481; 3.3 % IS481 only), 621 (75.4 %) were negative and 20 (2.4 %) were inhibitory for the PCR.

B. pertussis detection is performed by Real Time PCR (Q-PCR) directed to the insertion sequence IS481. However, this sequence is also found in the genome of B. bronchiseptica and B. holmesii. The latter is also a respiratory pathogen whose clinical features are similar to B. pertussis. However, it is important to differentiate between these species because in immunosuppressed patients B. holmesii is more likely to cause bacteremia and is less susceptible to erythromycin. The goal of this work is to measure prospectively and retrospectively the presence of B. holmesii in samples reported positive for B. pertussis in the period 2010-2011. During this period, 1994 nasopharyngeal specimens entered the laboratory for Bordetella sp. PCR, of which 224 were positive. The analysis by Q-PCR directed to the recA gene of B. holmesii of all 224 positive samples determined a prevalence of B. holmesii of 0.6% (12/1994). Because of its more aggressive behavior in immunosupressed patients and its different resistance pattern, routine screening of B. pertussis and B. holmesii is currently performed for all samples in which Bordetella sp PCR is initially detected.

Diagnosis was made using a polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the multicopy insertion sequence IS481, which is found in both Bordetella pertussis (Bp) and Bordetella holmesii (Bh). An increase in specimens testing positive for Bordetella parapertussis (Bpp) using insertion sequence IS1001 was also noted. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens submitted April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2011, were tested using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for Bp/Bh (IS481) and Bpp followed by singleplex assays for Bp and Bh. A subgroup of specimens was also cultured for Bordetella species, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on recovered organisms. Demographic and clinical features were compared for patients with Bp, Bh and Bpp. RESULTS: Of 520 IS481-positive specimens, 214 (41.1%) were positive for Bp, 79 (15.2%) were positive for Bh and 5 (1.0%) were positive for both Bp and Bh; 222 (42.7%) were negative for both targets. An additional 220 specimens were positive for Bpp. Among a sample of 155 IS481-positive specimens, 40, 15 and 0 were culture positive for Bp, Bh and Bpp, respectively. Among a sample of 55 BparaIS1001-positive (Bpp) specimens, 22, 0 and 0 were culture positive for Bpp, Bp and Bh, respectively. All Bordetella species were susceptible to macrolide antibiotics. Patients with Bh were older than patients with Bp, who were older than those positive for Bpp (mean ages: 12.0, 8.0 and 4.2 years, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). One or more classic signs of pertussis (ie, paroxysmal cough, whoop, post-tussive emesis) were seen in 55.9% of 263 patients (59 Bp, 24 Bh, 80 Bpp and 100 negative for Bordetella species), but did not differ statistically among the groups (chi = 5.1, P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: All 3 Bordetella species, Bp, Bh and Bpp, were detected during on outbreak of pertussis-like cough illness. There were noted differences in age and seasonality, but clinical features at the time of presentation did not allow clear differentiation of these infections. All Bordetella species recovered from culture and tested were susceptible in vitro to macrolide antibiotics. Additional study is necessary to further characterize epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of Bh-associated cough illness and to determine potential co-occurrence of Bordetella species with other bacterial and viral respiratory tract pathogens."

In some reports, up to 29% of the patients diagnosed with pertussis have in fact B. holmesii infection and invasive, non-respiratory B. holmesii infections have been reported worldwide. This misdiagnosis undermines the knowledge of pertussis' epidemiology, and may lead to misconceptions on pertussis vaccine's efficacy. Recently, the number of whooping cough cases has increased significantly in several countries. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether B. holmesii was contributing to the increase in laboratory-confirmed cases of B. pertussis in Switzerland. A multiplex species-specific quantitative PCR assay was performed on 196 nasopharyngeal samples from Swiss patients with PCR-confirmed Bordetella infection (median age: 6 years-old, minimum 21 days-old, maximum 86 years-old), formerly diagnosed as Bordetella pertussis (IS481+). No B. holmesii (IS481+, IS1001-, hIS1001+) was identified. We discuss whether laboratories should implement specific PCR to recognize different Bordetella species. We conclude that in Switzerland B. holmesii seems to be circulating less than in neighboring countries and that specific diagnostic procedures are not necessary routinely.

Although first reported to induce bacteremia mainly in immunocompromised patients, it has also been isolated in healthy persons and has shown the capacity to induce pertussis-like symptoms and other clinical entities, such as meningitis, arthritis, or endocarditis. Respiratory diseases are generally less severe than those induced by Bordetella pertussis. However, B. holmesii was found to have a higher capacity of invasiveness given the various infection sites in which it was isolated. The diagnosis is difficult, particularly as it is a slow-growing organism but also because respiratory infections are systematically misdiagnosed as B. pertussis. Treatment is delicate, as its susceptibility to macrolides (prescribed in respiratory infections) and ceftriaxone (used in invasive disease) is challenged. Regarding prevention, there is no consensus on prophylactic treatment following index cases and no vaccine is available. Epidemiological data are also sparse, with few prevalence studies available. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on B. holmesii. "

Recent reports have suggested that B. holmesii infections can be misdiagnosed as pertussis, which can have a significant impact on public health surveillance. This study investigated the presence of B. holmesii in B. pertussis positive clinical samples, in order to determine the incidence of B. holmesii. Clinical cases of pertussis diagnosed by IS481-specific PCR between October 2008 and March 2016 in New South Wales were included. Bordetella holmesii was detected through the simultaneous amplification of IS481 and B. holmesii specific insertions sequence, hIS1001. A total of 46 of 802 patients were identified to be positive for B. holmesii rather than B. pertussis, suggesting an incidence rate of 6.5% in 2009, 16.8% in 2010, 7.6% during 2013 and 8.1% during 2015. Bordetella holmesii infections were diagnosed during and between pertussis epidemics, however cases of B. holmesii and B. pertussis co-infections were not found. The predominant age group of B. holmesii infection was 11-18 years old, which was significantly different to the mean age of B. pertussis infections (0-6 years, p = 0.023). These findings revealed that B. holmesii was co-circulating alongside the B. pertussis epidemic for seven years, hidden from view, as B. holmesii infections have been diagnosed as B. pertussis. Confirmatory testing of B. pertussis positive samples for the presence of B. holmesii, especially during pertussis epidemics, should improve the quality of laboratory diagnosis and laboratory surveillance for pertussis. The presence of B. holmesii in Australia highlights the importance of testing for this pathogen and ongoing molecular surveillance that can guide the control of whooping cough."

The purposes of this study were to record the clinical manifestations and to identify an etiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We interviewed patients and parents and we performed physical examinations on patients with cough during the epidemic. The chest radiographs were also reviewed by us. To identify an etiology we performed culture and serologic studies for a variety of bacteria, Mycoplasma, chlamydiae and viruses. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Chlamydia pneumoniae was carried out on throat swab specimens. RESULTS: Of a total of 230 students 136 (59%) had severe cough illnesses.

METHODS: Children hospitalized with LRTI in Cape Town, South Africa were enrolled over 1 year. Clinical data were collected. A nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and induced sputum (IS) were taken, and polymerase chain reaction specific for Bordetella pertussis (IS481+/hIS1001-) and Bordetella parapertussis (IS1001+) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 460 children with median age 8 [interquartile range (IQR), 4-18] months were studied. B. pertussis was detected in 17 (3.7%) while total Bordetella spp. were identified on 23 (5.0 %) of 460 NP. Adding IS testing increased the identification of B. pertussis to 32 of 460 cases (7.0%; 95% confidence interval, 4.8%-9.7%); P = 0.028 and total Bordetella to 41 of 460 (8.9%; 95% confidence interval, 4-10%); P = 0.020. Shorter duration of symptoms [median 2 (IQR, 2-3) days versus 5 (IQR, 3-7) days; P = 0.0008] was associated with detection of B. pertussis on IS versus NP. B. pertussis was detected in 15.8% (n=3/19) of HIV-infected children, 10.9% (n = 10/92) of HIV exposed uninfected and 5.4% (n = 19/349) of HIV-unexposed uninfected children.

We assessed the burden of suffering related to prolonged coughing and tried to identify further causative agents. Based on a sentinel study with 35 general practitioners in two German cities (Krefeld, Rostock), with 3,946 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, we estimated the incidence of prolonged coughing in adults. In 975 of these outpatients, PCR and/or serology for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were performed. Treatment data were extracted for a subgroup of 138 patients. Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan-Maier curves were generated. Yearly incidence ranged between 1.4 and 2.1% per population in the two cities. Adult patients sought medical attention only after a median of 3 weeks of coughing. Irrespective of smoking and unrelated to the identified pathogens, the median duration of coughing was 6 weeks, with an interquartile range of 4-11 weeks. In 48.3% of patients, possible pathogens were identified, among which adenovirus (15.1%), RSV (7.5%), B. pertussis (5.6%), and influenza viruses (4.0%) were most often found. Symptoms were not indicative of a specific agent and a total of 64% of patients received antibiotics. Prolonged adult coughing requiring medical attention prompts substantial healthcare use.

Viral respiratory infections, such as rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus are likely to be important in the development and exacerbation of asthma. In this study, we investigated the nasopharyngeal colonization in children with asthma to determine the prevalence of pathogens and their contribution to respiratory symptoms and airway resistance during winter. Methods: From December 2016 to March 2017, 50 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 18 patients (age, 5.0+-1.1 years) with asthma and 9 specimens from 9 control children (age, 4.9+-1.0 years). Samples were tested for 19 viruses and 7 bacteria, using multiplex real-time PCR. Respiratory disease markers included the Global Asthma Network Questionnaire, the Common-Cold Questionnaire, the Global Initiative for Asthma assessment of asthma control, and the airway resistance at 5 Hz by forced-oscillation technique. Results: The most commonly isolated organisms in both groups (patients and controls) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and rhinovirus. Most patients had multiple isolates (median, 3.5; range, 1-5), which changed during the study period. Types of isolates were 4 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, and Bordetella parapertussis) and 6 viruses (rhinovirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses). Similar isolates, including influenza A-H3 virus and bocavirus, were detected in the controls. Of the 9 patients with ""wheezing disturbing sleep &gt;=1 per week"", 6 had rhinovirus, 2 coronaviruses, and 1 no detectable viruses. Patients with mild common cold symptoms had significantly higher airway resistance at 5 Hz z-score (P=0.025). Conclusion: Multiple respiratory pathogens were isolated from many patients with asthma, which appeared to contribute to disease symptoms and airway resistance. Minimizing children's exposure to respiratory pathogens might be beneficial, especially during winter."

AIM: Molecular testing of nasopharyngeal samples from children at the primary care paediatric department presenting with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). METHODOLOGY: From June 2016 to May 2017, 156 nasopharyngeal swabs from children diagnosed with ARTIs who had been admitted to or followed up as outpatients at the Department of Paediatrics, SANADOR Hospital (Bucharest, Romania) were tested for the presence of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis DNA. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae had the highest detection rate (53.8 %, n=84/156), followed by H. influenzae (41 %, n=64/156) and S. pneumoniae/H. influenzae co-detection (26.2 %, n=41/156). CONCLUSION: A definitive laboratory diagnosis of these micro-organisms can be made for invasive disease, but there are difficulties in establishing the aetiology for mucosal infection.

A study in Quito, Ecuador.ABSTRACT:Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of pertussis, which mainly affects unvaccinated children, while Bordetella parapertussis causes a disease presenting clinical characteristics that are indistinguishable from whooping cough. Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis remains a public health concern worldwide, with approximately 140000 cases reported annually. Here we determined the prevalence of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis infection among infants under one year of age by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); our aim being to identify whether the data obtained relates to the relevant sociodemographic and clinical data. The study included 86 samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from infants aged between 0-12 months, who were reported as probable cases of whooping cough by the health centers around the Ecuadorian highlands, from August 2016 to July 2017. The nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured and microbiological and molecular analyses were performed. B. pertussis was identified by PCR in 41% of the samples (30/86), more than half of which corresponded to infants aged between 0-3 months. Moreover, a statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) between the identification of bacteria in culture and the catarrhal stage of the disease was observed. The results obtained from the study highlighted the need for an active national surveillance of pertussis, in particular for laboratory testing, to provide a highly sensitive and more specific diagnosis of Bordetella infection."

This description can apply to disease caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and even protozoan organisms. In reality, differentiation as to etiology of pneumonia cannot be distinguished on the basis of clinical presentation. This review will discuss the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and laboratory diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia sp., Legionella sp., Bordetella pertussis, and Coxiella bumetii, the most common agents associated with atypical pneumonia. Unfortunately, because many of these pathogens are intracellular, culture systems are either not available or the techniques employed are costly, time-consuming or unsafe. Until molecular techniques are standardized and widely available, diagnosis will depend upon serologic confirmation. Given the relative importance of these organisms as causes of community acquired pneumonia, current practice guidelines recommend empiric therapy with a macrolide in patients well enough to be treated as an outpatient. However, diagnostic tests should be performed in any patient requiring hospitalization."

METHODS: The following data sources were utilized: the Medline and LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude) bibliographic databases; World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization documents published between 1980 and 2002; Internet materials in Portuguese, Spanish, or English located using the search terms ""pneumonia, child, adolescent, etiology, treatment""; and interviews with renowned experts in the field. RESULTS: Hospitalization is always required for children younger than 2 months of age. That age group should be treated with ampicillin and aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins. Children older than 2 months must be hospitalized if there is severe pneumonia. Tachypnea should be used as the criterion to distinguish between acute respiratory infection and pneumonia. Pneumonia is considered to be very severe when there are seizures, sleepiness, stridor at rest, severe malnutrition, no ingestion of fluids, or signs of respiratory failure such as central cyanosis. Children who are 2 months of age or older may receive outpatient treatment with amoxicillin or penicillin G procaine. In the case of inpatient treatment, crystalline penicillin or ampicillin may be used for severe cases, and oxacillin and chloramphenicol or ceftriaxone for very severe cases. A macrolide, preferably erythromycin, should be employed when the etiologic agent is suspected to be Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Bordetella pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of pneumonia and the need for hospitalization can be based on clinical assessment. The main antibiotics to be used are amoxicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, and aminoglycosides, depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease."

SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in a university-affiliated tertiary pediatric hospital in Melbourne, Australia. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and radiology reports of patients with a diagnosis of pertussis identified from the pediatric intensive care unit database. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (median age, 6 wks; interquartile range, 4-8 wks) required 55 admission episodes to the pediatric intensive care unit. Main reasons for admission were apnea with or without cough paroxysms (63%), pneumonia (18%), and seizures (10%). None of the infants had completed the primary course of immunization, and 94% had not received a single dose of pertussis vaccine. Infants presenting with pneumonia presented earlier (p = .001), had longer intensive care stay (p = .007), higher white cell count (p &lt; or = .001), lower Pao2 at admission (p = .020), and higher mortality. Six infants out of seven needing circulatory support died (including all four treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), and all deaths (n = 7) occurred in infants who had pneumonia at presentation. CONCLUSION: Patients with pertussis, presenting as apnea (with or without cough paroxysms), treated in the pediatric intensive care unit had 100% survival. However, pneumonia as the main reason for admission and the need for circulatory support is associated with a very poor outcome.

Approximately 90% of all deaths due to pertussis in the Unites States occur in young infants. These children often develop intractable pulmonary hypertension; however, the pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for this complication has not been well characterized, and there have been no detailed descriptions of the pathology of this disease since the 1940s. METHODS: Respiratory tissue samples obtained at autopsy from 15 infants aged &lt;or=4 months who had polymerase chain reaction- or culture-confirmed B. pertussis pneumonia were evaluated by multiple histochemical stains, immunohistochemical evaluation, and electron microscopic examination. RESULTS: The pulmonary histopathologic examination of the samples revealed a descending infection dominated by necrotizing bronchiolitis, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrinous edema. All samples had marked leukocytosis, and most showed luminal aggregates of abundant leukocytes in small pulmonary arteries, veins, and lymphatics. A novel immunohistochemical stain for B. pertussis revealed abundant extracellular bordetellae in cilia of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, as well as intracellular bacteria and antigens in alveolar macrophages and ciliated epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis should be suspected in any infant death associated with marked leukocytosis, bronchopneumonia, or refractory pulmonary hypertension, particularly in children aged &lt;or=4 months. The pathologic findings identified in the respiratory tracts of these children, in addition to recognized physiologic responses of the infant lung to hypoxia, suggest that B. pertussis pneumonia triggers a cascade of events that includes acute pulmonary vasoconstriction and pertussis toxin-mediated increases in circulating leukocyte mass. These responses ultimately compromise pulmonary blood flow, exacerbate hypoxemia, and create a vicious cycle of refractory pulmonary hypertension."

In adults the most common acute CAPs with a prominent and persistent nonproductive cough are due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophilia (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, or Bordetella pertussis (pertussis). Pertussis is an underrecognized and underappreciated cause of CAP in adults. Different from classic pertussis in children, pertussis in adults presents with prolonged dry cough, that is, the ""100-day cough."" In pertussis, the characteristic nonspecific laboratory findings are leukocytosis and relative lymphocytosis. Dry cough accompanied by hoarseness with CAP in an adult should suggest C. pneumoniae or a respiratory virus (eg, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus). METHODS: We present the case of a young woman who presented with a prominent and persistent pertussis-like cough with hoarseness. She had no leukocytosis or relative lymphopenia, which argued against the diagnosis of pertussis. Notably, she had persistent monocytosis. Her protracted pertussis-like cough that persisted during her hospitalization was so impressive that the diagnostic impression was pertussis. Direct fluorescent antibody (FA) and throat cultures were negative for pertussis. Furthermore, her hoarseness suggested the possibility of C. pneumoniae, but her C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin-M titer was negative. RESULTS: Because C. pneumoniae was ruled out, her hoarseness suggested a respiratory viral cause. A respiratory FA viral panel and viral throat cultures were obtained. The respiratory FA viral panel was negative for influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and parainfluenza viruses. However, her viral throat cultures grew parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV 3), confirming the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of HPIV 3 CAP presenting with a prominent and persistent pertussoid cough in an adult mimicking pertussis with hoarseness and monocytosis."

The fibrosis and obstruction of the terminal and respiratory bronchioles, likely caused by respiratory infections in early childhood, prevents normal development of the alveolar bud. Organisms that have been associated with this syndrome include adenovirus, measles, bordetella pertussis, mycobacterium spp, influenza A and mycoplasma. The syndrome is an acquired cause of unilateral emphysema. The diagnosis of the syndrome can be made in infancy or early childhood, but in asymptomatic individuals can be delayed until adulthood and rarely in the elderly. Chest radiographs and computed tomographic (CT) scan can confirm the diagnosis and exclude other possibilities. A case of Swyer- James Macleod syndrome diagnosed at age 63 in a patient with recurrent respiratory infections and a history of childhood pertussis is presented."

Bordetella infection was identified by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal specimens. Neither B. pertussis nor B. parapertussis were recovered on the culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from any subjects. M. pneumoniae etiology was diagnosed by culture and RT-PCR. The evolution was fatal for all of the subjects. We conclude that, among patients with Bordetella infection, co-infection with another respiratory pathogen is often probable, and these mixed infections might cause a more severe form of illness, sometimes leading to death."

Adults with CAP admitted from November 2009 to October 2010 were included. Demographics, comorbidities, severity and clinical features were recorded. Conventional microbiological methods included blood and sputum cultures, acute and convalescent serologic samples, and antigen urinary detection. New methods included multiplex PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 15 respiratory viruses. A total of 169 patients were included. Using conventional methods, we identified a pathogen in 51 % of cases. With PCR, up to 70 % of cases had an aetiological diagnosis. Forty-five patients had BP (34 %), 22 had VP (17 %) and 25 (19 %) had co-infection (BP and VP). Pneumococci and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) median values were significantly higher in BP than in VP patients. Shaking chills, higher CURB score and shock were significantly more frequent in BP. A viral infection was identified in more than one-third of patients with CAP. Clinical and laboratory features could help to differentiate between VP and BP and to guide empirical therapy."

Of the 31 children who died, 77% were less than 1 year of age, 48% were boys, 58% were malnourished, 29% had previous respiratory disease, and 22% had previous congenital disease. All children who died had clinical diagnoses of pneumonia (71%) or bronchiolitis (29%). Autopsies were performed in 14 of the cases. Viral etiology was determined by both cell culture and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay of either nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) or lung tissue and bacterial etiology was determined by isolation of organisms from blood, lung tissue, and/or pleural fluid. NPA was examined for Bordetella pertussis by IIF. Pathogens were identified in 65% of fatal cases. Seven cases were bacterial; seven cases were viral; and six cases resulted from mixed infections. Lung tissue yielded positive etiologic results in 10 of 13 cases. Histopathologic examination performed on specimens from the 14 autopsied children revealed necrotizing bronchiolitis with intranuclear inclusions (n = 5) and multifocal pneumonia (n = 9)."

A total of 1,003 children less than 5 years of age (805 inpatients and 198 outpatients) presenting with ALRI were studied during a 40-month period. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), blood, urine, and throat-swab samples were collected when each child was first seen for care. Virologic studies were performed on the NPA by means of indirect immunofluorescence and isolation of virus in cell culture. Bacteriologic studies primarily were done by means of culture of blood or pleural fluid (when available); Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, however, were searched for by the use of immunofluorescence and complement-fixation testing, respectively, in paired sera. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most commonly isolated virus, followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by B. pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

A chest radiograph showed poorly-defined nodular opacities in the left lung. Due to the significant rise in serum antibodies for both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and B. pertussis, a diagnosis of dual infection with the organisms was made. Despite the use of susceptible antibiotics, the patient symptoms did not improve and her chest radiograph showed migratory pulmonary infiltrates. However, a quinolone derivative, moxifloxacin, dramatically improved her symptoms and resolved the pulmonary infiltrates shortly after administration. In this case, due to the lymphocyte-stimulatory nature of M. pneumoniae and B. pertussis, an increased immunological response was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. The immunomodulatory property of moxifloxacin was thought to repress the increased lymphocyte activity, and thus facilitated complete remission of the disease."

Norway also has one of the highest rates of reported Bordetella pertussis infections, despite high vaccine coverage. We aimed to determine the prevalence of upper respiratory tract pathogens in patients attending primary care physicians for respiratory illness during the 2011 M. pneumoniae epidemic period. A retrospective analysis of data from 26,039 patients that have had nasopharyngeal swabs analysed by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and B. pertussis was performed. Subsets of samples were tested for additional pathogenic bacteria, including B. parapertussis and B. holmesii, as well as influenza virus. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and B. pertussis were detected in 2,484 (9.5 %), 261 (1.0 %) and 821 (3.2 %) patients, respectively. Co-infection of M. pneumoniae and B. pertussis was found in 50 (0.19 %) patients, C. pneumoniae and B. pertussis in 4 (0.02 %). Influenza virus was found in 899 (24.5 %) of 3,661 nasopharyngeal swabs. Co-infection of influenza virus and bacterial pathogens was common, although influenza virus co-infection with B. pertussis occurred significantly more often than with C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae (20.4 % versus 2.9 % and 9.1 %, respectively; p&lt;0.005). Testing for Bordetella species genes IS1001, IS1002 and recA showed that B. holmesii was most likely misdiagnosed as B. pertussis in 5.8 % of cases. The most prevalent respiratory tract pathogen in the general population in 2011 was M. pneumoniae. B. pertussis was also found frequently as was B. pertussis and influenza virus co-infections."

We describe two young infants, monozygotic twins, with a severe B. pertussis pneumonia of whom one needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Diagnostic work-up of unexplained hematuria and proteinuria during the illness revealed low serum complement component 3 (C3) levels. During follow-up, C3 levels remained low (400-600 mg/L). Extensive analysis of the persistent low C3 levels revealed an unknown heterozygous mutation in the C3 gene in both siblings and their mother. This C3 mutation in combination with the specific virulence mechanisms of B. pertussis probably contributed to the severe disease course in these cases. CONCLUSION: We propose that genetically caused complement disorders should be considered when confronted with severe cases of B. pertussis infection."

METHODS: The serum samples and nasopharyngeal secretions were collected from 176 patients with cough for a prolonged duration ( &gt;= 2 weeks) from 2011 to 2012 at Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics. Multiplex PCR of nasopharyngeal secretion was employed to identify B.pertussis. And enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) was used to detect antibody to pertussis toxin(PT-IgG). Total bacterial DNA was enacted from nasopharyngeal secretion and two-target IS481/PT of B.pertussis was detected by PCR. The sera and nasopharyngeal secretions were also collected from household contacts with cough for a prolonged duration. Their clinical characteristic and epidemiological profiles were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: B.Pertussis infection was demonstrated in 51 cases (29.0%). The patients ages were from 23 days to 4 years. Among them, 46 cases (90.2%) were aged under 12 months and 5 cases (9.8%) over 12 months. And 40 cases were unvaccinated (31 cases &lt;3 months old, 4 cases 3-12 months old, 5 cases &gt;5 years old) and 11 cases incompletely vaccinated. There were 31 males and 20 females. More patients were found in spring and summer than those in autumn and winter. Nine infant cases had 12 household contacts. Among 12 household contacts, 3 were PCR positive and 12 PT-IgG positive. Pertussis was remarkably critical in infants. Serious complications included failure to thrive, pneumonia, respiratory failure and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: B.pertussis infection is an important cause in unvaccinated or incomplete vaccinated infants with prolonged cough. Peak seasons of pertussis are spring and summer. Undiagnosed adolescents and adults with pertussis may be a significant source for transmission of B.pertussis to other susceptible children. Infants aged under 1 year are at risk for severe pertussis and life-threatening complications. As a rapid and sensitive method of detecting B.pertussis, PCR may be used in early phase."

However, relatively little is known about interactions between atypical bacteria and influenza viruses. A recent report by Reinton et al. explored this issue by analyzing data from 3,661 patients seeking medical assistance for the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis, as well as influenza A or B virus in nasal swab specimens. The report, however, did not accurately assess the epidemiologic interactions of these pathogens. We aimed to describe the interactions between these bacterial species and influenza infections. Strong and highly statistically significant antagonistic interspecies interactions were detected between C. pneumoniae and influenza virus [odds ratio (OR): 0.09; p &lt; 0.0001) and M. pneumoniae and influenza virus infections (OR: 0.29; p = 0.003). No association was detected between B. pertussis and influenza infection (p = 0.34), contrary to the initial report, and coinfection was not detected at a higher-than-by-chance frequency within the population. Further support of these results is supplied by the analysis of two earlier investigations reporting data on influenza virus and these atypical bacteria. Our results supplement the large body of literature regarding interactions between influenza virus and typical respiratory pathogens, providing a fuller picture of the spectrum of interactions between influenza viruses and respiratory bacteria. Further, we demonstrate the importance of choosing the most appropriate reference populations for the analysis being performed and describe the pitfalls that may occur when care is not taken in this regard."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 663 patients (323 girls and 340 boys) hospitalized due to pneumonia in the period of 2009-2012 were enrolled. Diagnostic procedures to determine the etiology were performed in 400/663 (60.3%) children. Type of diagnostic procedures depended on medical history, disease's course and patient's condition and included 336 blood cultures, 257 measurements of antibody titers against Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 12 measurements of antibody titers against Bordetella pertussis, 14 pleural fluid cultures (deriving from 9 patients). Using the BiNet network 51 specimens (45 blood specimens, 4 pleural fluid, 2 bacterial strains) were send to the KOROUN in order to perform molecular diagnostic in search of encapsulated bacteria. RESULTS: Etiology of pneumonia was found in 9.7% (64/663) of all patients with diagnosed CAP, what accounted for 16% (64/400) of children in which the diagnostics was taken. The most frequent agent was atypical bacteria which was found in 14.75% (59/400) patients (in 26 patients - Chlamydophila pneumoniae, 11 - Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 22 - mixed infection). Bacterial etiology was confirmed in 1.25% (5/400) of patients (Streptococcus pneumoniae-3 patients, Streptococcus pyogenes i Bordetella pertussis - 1 patient each other). Efficacy of a single blood culture was very low - 0.6% (2/336). Pleural fluid culture was positive only in 1 of 9 drained patients (S. pyogenes). Thanks to the use of BiNet network (KOROUN) etiology of severe pneumonia in 3 patients has been determined. 2 of those patients suffered from invasive pneumococcal disease, which was not diagnosed with standard microbiological procedures (blood cultures). CONCLUSIONS: The methods currently used in the diagnosis of pneumonia is inadequate. It was possible to determine the etiology of only 10% of children hospitalized. The most common cause of pneumonia that seen were atypical infection (8.9%). The effectiveness of single blood culture in determining the etiology of pneumonia was very low and amounted to 0.6%.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 1,209 patients with pertussis. Data were obtained through the Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sistema de Informacao de Agravos de Notificacao - SINAN) and molecular epidemiology was performed by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR; DiversiLab , bioMerieux, France). RESULTS: The incidence of pertussis in the state of Parana increased sharply from 0.15-0.76 per 100,000 habitants between 2007-2010 to 1.7-4.28 per 100,000 between 2011-2013. Patients with less than 1 year of age were more stricken (67.5%). Fifty-nine children (5%) developed pertussis even after receiving three doses and two diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) boosters vaccine. The most common complications were pneumonia (14.5%), otitis (0.9%), and encephalopathy (0.7%). Isolates of B. pertussis were grouped into two groups (G1 and G2) and eight distinct patterns (G1: P1-P5 and G2: P6-P8). CONCLUSION: The resurgence of pertussis should stimulate new research to develop vaccines with greater capacity of protection against current clones and also encourage implementation of new strategies for vaccination in order to reduce the risk of disease in infants."

The aims of this study were to investigate the bacterial aetiology of CAP in hospitalized patients in Norway, risk factors for CAP and possible differences in risk factors between patients with Legionnaire's disease and pneumonia because of other causes. METHODS: Adult patients with radiologically confirmed CAP admitted to hospital were eligible for the study. Routine aerobic and Legionella culture of sputum, blood culture, urinary antigen test for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, polymerase chain reaction detection of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis from throat specimens, and serology for L. pneumophila serogroup 1-6 were performed. A questionnaire, which included demographic and clinical data, risk factors and treatment, was completed. RESULTS: We included 374 patients through a 20-month study period in 2007-2008. The aetiological agent was detected in 37% of cases. S. pneumoniae (20%) was the most prevalent agent, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (6%) and Legionella spp. (6%). Eight Legionella cases were diagnosed by urinary antigen test, of which four also had positive serology. In addition, 13 Legionella cases were diagnosed by serology. The degree of comorbidity was high. An increased risk of hospital-diagnosed Legionella pneumonia was found among patients with a diagnosis of chronic congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that S. pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients, and the prevalence of Legionella pneumonia is probably higher in Norway than recognized previously."

We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional methods to describe etiology of CAP in hospitalized adults and evaluated their respective diagnostic yields. METHODS: 267 CAP patients were enrolled consecutively over our 3-year prospective study. Conventional methods (i.e., bacterial cultures, urinary antigen assays, serology) were combined with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and by real-time PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 12 types of respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Etiology was established in 167 (63%) patients with 69 (26%) patients having &gt;=1 copathogen. There were 75 (28%) pure bacterial and 41 (15%) pure viral infections, and 51 (19%) viral-bacterial coinfections, resulting in 126 (47%) patients with bacterial and 92 (34%) patients with viral etiology. S. pneumoniae (30%), influenza (15%) and rhinovirus (12%) were most commonly identified, typically with &gt;=1 copathogen. During winter and spring, viruses were detected more frequently (45%, P=.01) and usually in combination with bacteria (39%). PCR improved diagnostic yield by 8% in 64 cases with complete sampling (and by 15% in all patients); 5% for detection of bacteria; 19% for viruses (P=.04); and 16% for detection of &gt;=1 copathogen. Etiology was established in 79% of 43 antibiotic-naive patients with complete sampling. S. pneumoniae qPCR positive rate was significantly higher for OP swab compared to NP swab (P&lt;.001). Positive rates for serology were significantly higher than for real-time PCR in detecting B. pertussis (P=.001) and influenza viruses (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Etiology could be established in 4 out of 5 CAP patients with the aid of PCR, particularly in diagnosing viral infections. S. pneumoniae and viruses were most frequently identified, usually with copathogens. Viral-bacterial coinfections were more common than pure infections during winter and spring; a finding we consider important in the proper management of CAP. When swabbing for qPCR detection of S. pneumoniae in adult CAP, OP appeared superior to NP, but this finding needs further confirmation.

","SPECIES:Bordetella pertussisID:26623626TITLE:Bordetella pertussis diagnosis in children under five years of age in the Regional Hospital of Cajamarca, Northern Peru.ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Bordetella pertussis is an important human pathogen that causes whooping cough (pertussis), an endemic illness responsible of significant morbidity and mortality, especially in infants and children. Worldwide, there are an estimated of 16 million cases of pertussis, resulting in about 195,000 child deaths per year. In Peru, pertussis is a major health problem that has been on the increase despite immunization efforts. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis among children under five years of age suspected to have whopping cough in Cajamarca, Peru. METHODOLOGY: Children diagnosed with whooping cough admitted to the Hospital Regional de Cajamarca from August 2010 to July 2013 were included. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained for B. pertussis culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection. RESULTS: In 133 children, the pertussis toxin and IS481 gene were detected in 38.35% (51/133) of the cases by PCR, while only 9.02% (12/133) of the Bordetella cultures were positive. The most frequent symptoms in patients with positive B. pertussis were paroxysm of coughing 68.63% (35/51), cyanosis 56.86% (29/51), respiratory distress 43.14% (22/51), and fever 39.22% (20/51). Pneumonia and acute bronchial obstructive syndrome were present in 17.65% (9/51) and 13.72% (7/51) of the cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: B. pertussis is responsible for an important proportion of whooping cough in hospitalized children in Cajamarca. Epidemiologic surveillance programs for B. pertussis are essential in Peru, especially in children who could most benefit from the vaccine."

The cost of the outbreak to this hospital was $97 745. Heightened awareness of pertussis in NICUs is key to preventing healthcare-associated spread and minimizing outbreak-control-related costs. Bordetella pertussis is a highly communicable bacterial pathogen that causes a prolonged cough illness and is spread by respiratory droplet transmission. Infants aged &lt;=6 months are most susceptible to B pertussis infection and pertussis-associated complications, including pneumonia, encephalopathy, and death, and are commonly hospitalized for treatment [ 1]. Despite a universal pertussis vaccination program, 27 550 pertussis cases were reported in the United States during 2010 [ 2]. Pertussis outbreaks in healthcare settings can be challenging and costly to control [3]. On September 13, 2011 and September 15, 2011, 3 pertussis cases, including 2 confirmed by B pertussis isolation, among preterm infants discharged &lt;=30 days previously from a 71-bed NICU of a general hospital (NICU A) were reported by Hospital B, a large pediatric facility, to Maricopa County Department of Public Health. This report describes the outbreak, examines outbreak-associated costs and risk factors that might have contributed to healthcare-associated transmission, and provides guidance to prevent outbreaks in healthcare settings.

METHOD: A retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 247 children with whooping cough in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between Jan 2013 and Dec 2014. Of these patients, 126 were male, 121 were female, the median age was 3.1 months (23 days-4 years and eight months old). The patients were divided into two groups, group 1 had infants less than 3 months of age (n=120) and group 2 had infants and young children older than 3 months (n=127) according to their age. On the other hand, the patients were also divided into two groups according to vaccination status: vaccinated group (received diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis, DTP) (n=31) and unvaccinated group (n=188). Pure Bordetella pertussis infection was seen in 106 cases, and 141 cases had mixed infection. Severe disease was seen in 13 cases, and the other 234 cases had the modest disease. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed and compared. RESULT: (1) Bordetella pertussis was identified in 57/680 cases (8.4%) in 2013, and 190/1 856 cases (10.2%) in 2014. The disease could be seen throughout the year, but 182 cases (73.7%) occurred in summer or autumn; 202 cases (81.8%) were less than 6 months. (2) Paroxysmal cough was seen in 238 cases (96.4%) , 61 cases (24.7%) had inspiratory whoop. Infants in group 1 often had episodes of cyanosis, apnea and suffocation (chi2 = 19.999, 12.081, 6.508, P&lt;0.05), persistent cough was often seen in group 2 (chi2 = 9.885, P&lt;0.05). Complications such as severe pneumonia, pulmonary consolidation and encephalopathy were more common in the group 1 than in group 2 (chi2 = 17.340, 6.080, 11.030, 23.545, P&lt;0.05). (3) The length of stay of group 1, and of unvaccinated group was significantly longer than that of group 2 and of vaccinated group (t=19.331, 26.741, P&lt;0.05). (4) Leukocytosis was found in 224 cases (90.7%), 182 cases (73.7%) had predominant lymphocytosis. White blood cell in group 1, unvaccinated group and severe disease group was higher than the corresponding group (t=11.075,13.739,3.469, P&lt;0.05). (5) Patients who had a history of exposure, fever, leukocytosis and pulmonary consolidation or atelectasis on chest imaging were prone to develop into severe pertussis (OR=4.521, 4.900, 1.085, 4.792, 50.400; P&lt;0.05). A total of 244 cases (98.8%) recovered, 3 cases (1.2%) died, they were less than 3 months old and unvaccinated. CONCLUSION: The number of cases with whooping cough in Chongqing area tends to be rising. The disease occurred mostly in summer and fall. Infants less than 3 months old, unvaccinated with DTP had high susceptibility to pertussis, often had a severe clinical presentation and severe complications, had a high mortality rate."

The cause of pneumonia after introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has not been well studied in low-income and middle-income countries, and most data are from cross-sectional studies of children admitted to hospital. We aimed to longitudinally investigate the incidence and causes of childhood pneumonia in a South African birth cohort. METHODS: We did a nested case-control study of children in the Drakenstein Child Health Study who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012, to Dec 1, 2014. Children received immunisations including acellular pertussis vaccine and PCV13. A nested subgroup had nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks throughout infancy. We identified pneumonia episodes and collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and induced sputum specimens. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum of pneumonia cases and in nasopharyngeal swabs of age-matched and site-matched controls. To show associations between organisms and pneumonia we used conditional logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 314 pneumonia cases occurred (incidence of 0 27 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 0 24-0 31; median age 5 months [IQR 3-9]) in 967 children during 1145 child-years of follow-up. 60 (21%) cases of pneumonia were severe (incidence 0 05 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0 04-0 07]) with a case fatality ratio of 1% (three deaths). A median of five organisms (IQR 4-6) were detected in cases and controls with nasopharyngeal swabs, and a median of six organisms (4-7) recorded in induced sputum (p=0 48 compared with nasopharyngeal swabs). Bordetella pertussis (OR 11 08, 95% CI 1 33-92 54), respiratory syncytial virus (8 05, 4 21-15 38), or influenza virus (4 13, 2 06-8 26) were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were also associated with pneumonia. In cases, testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of B pertussis and several viruses. INTERPRETATION: Pneumonia remains common in this highly vaccinated population. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently detected pathogen associated with pneumonia; influenza virus and B pertussis were also strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of induced sputum increases the yield for detection of several organisms. New vaccines and strategies are needed to address the burden of childhood pneumonia.

METHODS:  Children 1-59 months of age hospitalized with World Health Organization-defined severe or very severe pneumonia in 7 African and Asian countries and similarly aged community controls were enrolled in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study. They underwent a standardized clinical evaluation and provided nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and induced sputum (cases only) for Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain reaction. Risk factors and pertussis-associated clinical findings were identified. RESULTS:  Bordetella pertussis was detected in 53 of 4200 (1.3%) cases and 11 of 5196 (0.2%) controls. In the age stratum 1-5 months, 40 (2.3% of 1721) cases were positive, all from African sites, as were 8 (0.5% of 1617) controls. Pertussis-positive African cases 1-5 months old, compared to controls, were more often human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uninfected-exposed (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.2), unvaccinated (aOR, 3.7), underweight (aOR, 6.3), and too young to be immunized (aOR, 16.1) (all P &lt;= .05). Compared with pertussis-negative African cases in this age group, pertussis-positive cases were younger, more likely to vomit (aOR, 2.6), to cough &gt;=14 days (aOR, 6.3), to have leukocyte counts &gt;20 000 cells/microL (aOR, 4.6), and to have lymphocyte counts &gt;10 000 cells/microL (aOR, 7.2) (all P &lt;= .05). The case fatality ratio of pertussis-infected pneumonia cases 1-5 months of age was 12.5% (95% confidence interval, 4.2%-26.8%; 5/40); pertussis was identified in 3.7% of 137 in-hospital deaths among African cases in this age group. CONCLUSIONS:  In the postneonatal period, pertussis causes a small fraction of hospitalized pneumonia cases and deaths; however, case fatality is substantial. The propensity to infect unvaccinated infants and those at risk for insufficient immunity (too young to be vaccinated, premature, HIV-infected/exposed) suggests that the role for maternal vaccination should be considered along with efforts to reduce exposure to risk factors and to optimize childhood pertussis vaccination coverage."

The prevalence of atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis among patients with these illnesses in the ambulatory setting has not been previously summarized. We set out to derive prevalence information from the existing literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE for prospective, consecutive-series studies reporting the prevalence of M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, L pneumophila and/or B pertussis in outpatients with cough, acute bronchitis, LRTI, or CAP. Articles were independently reviewed by 2 authors for inclusion and abstraction of data; discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion. A meta-analysis was performed on each pathogen to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates using a random effects model of raw proportions. RESULTS: Fifty studies met our inclusion criteria. While calculated heterogeneity was high, most studies reported prevalence for each pathogen within a fairly narrow range. In patients with CAP, the overall prevalences of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were 10.1% (95% CI, 7.1%-13.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%), respectively. Consistent with previous reports, M pneumoniae prevalence peaked in roughly 6-year intervals. Overall prevalence of L pneumophila was 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%), but the organism was rare in children, with only 1 case in 1,765. In patients with prolonged cough in primary care, the prevalence of B pertussis was 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-19.8%), although it was higher in studies that included only children (17.6%; 95% CI, 3.4%-31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical bacterial pathogens are relatively common causes of lower respiratory diseases, including cough, bronchitis, and CAP. Where surveillance data were available, we found higher prevalences in studies where all patients are tested for these pathogens. It is likely that these conditions are underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in current clinical practice."

The organism was not isolated in any child but Bordetella pertussis was isolated from 65. Two of the latter and one of the remaining 189 children with negative isolation, however, had immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis (titers of 1:64, 1:64 and 1:128). Exhaustive absorption of the sera with bordetella antigen left the chlamydial titers unchanged, thus excluding the possibility of cross-reactivity with bordetella antigen. To determine whether nonspecific stimulation of B lymphocytes played a role, sera from 72 children with infectious mononucleosis were examined. Chlamydial IgM antibodies (greater than or equal to 1:64) were detected in 14 of these sera, significantly more often than in other acute childhood infections (p = 0.002). Serotyping showed that these antibodies had a heterogeneous specificity in different sera and a reactivity pattern suggesting they were monoclonal. The association found between chlamydial IgM antibodies and Epstein-Barr virus infection implies that there is nonspecific production of these antibodies in infectious mononucleosis, suggesting that similar nonspecific antibody production could occur in other infections. This might explain the chlamydial IgM found in children with lower respiratory tract infections in whom chlamydial infection could not be confirmed by isolation."

(1) Eighty cases were positive in pertussis nucleic acid detection (positive rate was 41.0%), 47 males and 33 females, age ranged from one month to ten years, all of them had paroxysmal cough (100.0%), 50 cases with spasmodic cough (62.5%), 9 cases with vomiting after cough(11.2%), 22 cases with cyanosis after cough(27.5%), 13 cases with roaring after cough(16.2%), 4 cases with dyspnea(5.0%), 18 cases were diagnosed as pneumonia by chest radiography(22.5%) and 1 case was diagnosed as pertussis encephalopathy(1.2%); (2) 172 cases of respiratory virus DIF detection were completed and 69 of them were positive(positive rate was 40.1%), including 32 cases positive for RSV(18.6%), 29 cases for PIVIII(16.8%); (3) In 80 confirmed pertussis children, 66 cases of respiratory virus DIF detection were completed and 9 were positive(9/66, 13.6%), including 7 cases positive for PIVIII. The clinical manifestations were cyanosis after cough(6 cases), dyspnea(2 cases) and pneumonia were diagnosed by chest radiography in 3 cases, the clinical symptoms of these children were more prominent than children with general pertussis; (4) Patients were divided into three groups according to the pathogens: 57 cases in single pertussis group, 32 cases in RSV infection group, 22 cases in single PIVIII infection group.The cases of spasmodic cough in Pertussis group was 35 (61.4%), RSV infection group was 7(21.9%), single PIVIII infection group was 8(36.4%), compared with the other two groups, the incidence of spasmodic cough were higher in Pertussis group (chi(2) =12.850, 4.013, P&lt;0.05). The cases of roaring in Pertussis group was 11 (19.3%), RSV infection group was 1(3.1%), single PIVIII infection group was 0, and the incidence were higher in Pertussis group (chi(2)=4.596, 4.932, P&lt;0.05). The cases of dyspnea in Pertussis group was 2 (3.5%), RSV infection group was 11(34.4%), single PIVIII infection group was 0, and the incidence was higher in RSV infection group (chi(2)=15.654, 9.487, P&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Pertussis is common in children, especially in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants. The typical clinical manifestation is paroxysmal spasmodic cough; complicated with PIVIII infection is a risk factor for sever pertussis. Early detecting of Bordetella by PCR is helpful for the diagnosis of pertussis, RSV and PIVIII are the main pathogen for Pertussis-like syndrome.

Annually, about 50% of more than 2.5 million pilgrims participating in this ritual get involved in severe devastating coughs. Most coughs continue, so the pilgrims turn back home and transmit them to family members and other people. Despite the high prevalence of coughs for many years, what causes them remains unknown. Considering the pertussis-like clinical picture of the so-called ""hajj coughs"", the researchers conducted a study to measure antibodies against three known common atypical bacteria, namely Bordetella Pertussis, Chlamydia Pneumonia and Mycoplasma Pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was done on three out of eleven groups of pilgrims from Yazd province, central Iran. The sample was selected randomly and consisted of 202 pilgrims who completed an informed consent. Their blood samples were taken, and the plasma was separated and then stored at -70  C. After turning back from the journey, the pilgrims had their second blood samples taken. As many as 52 pilgrims failed to come for the second sampling, and two samples were broken during transportation. The final analysis was performed on the remaining 148 pairs of samples. RESULTS: Antibodies were already elevated in many pilgrims before the journey probably due to their old age (causing more exposure to pathogens) or unplanned pertussis vaccination. After their return, antibody elevation was only mild, again probably due to the old age of the participants (i.e. due to their weaker immune systems). Some antibodies even fell down without any known reason. In this study, previous hajj journey was assumed as a prophylactic factor, due to acquisition of immunity. Coughs with a prolonged pertussis-like picture were also presumed to be more related than other types of coughs to atypical pathogens. Statistical tests showed that the history of previous journeys had no prophylactic effect. Also, no correlation was found between the clinical pictures of coughs and infection with atypical bacteria. CONCLUSION: Even though some rises and falls occurred in the antibodies titer, the variations could hardly be attributed to coughs in this study. Indeed, the variation of antibodies had no meaningful relationship with clinical factors. In this regard, further studies are needed to clarify the reason for the so-called ""hajj coughs"", but epidemiological studies will be difficult to do until easier and more reliable methods become available for accurate diagnosis."

We assessed the burden of suffering related to prolonged coughing and tried to identify further causative agents. Based on a sentinel study with 35 general practitioners in two German cities (Krefeld, Rostock), with 3,946 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, we estimated the incidence of prolonged coughing in adults. In 975 of these outpatients, PCR and/or serology for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were performed. Treatment data were extracted for a subgroup of 138 patients. Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan-Maier curves were generated. Yearly incidence ranged between 1.4 and 2.1% per population in the two cities. Adult patients sought medical attention only after a median of 3 weeks of coughing. Irrespective of smoking and unrelated to the identified pathogens, the median duration of coughing was 6 weeks, with an interquartile range of 4-11 weeks. In 48.3% of patients, possible pathogens were identified, among which adenovirus (15.1%), RSV (7.5%), B. pertussis (5.6%), and influenza viruses (4.0%) were most often found. Symptoms were not indicative of a specific agent and a total of 64% of patients received antibiotics. Prolonged adult coughing requiring medical attention prompts substantial healthcare use. Apart from B. pertussis, a broad range of pathogens was associated with the symptoms.

Hyperleukocytosis [white blood cell (WBC) count &gt;100 x 10/L] is a rare complication that strongly predicts mortality in cases of severe pertussis. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of severe pertussis in an infant who initially presented with persistent cyanotic cough, tachypnea, and grunting. The infant's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) during her third hour of hospitalization. On the third hospital day, her WBC count had increased to 101.85 x 10/L with a lymphocyte count of 36.76 x 10/L, and her hemoglobin level had fallen to 6.9 g/dL. Bone marrow examination found no evidence of tumor cells. Her initial echocardiogram showed no abnormal findings; however, a subsequent echocardiogram 10 days later revealed pulmonary hypertension. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, which was confirmed to be pertussis based on a persistent cough in the infant's mother and the polymerase chain reaction and culture of the infant's nasopharyngeal secretions being positive for Bordetella pertussis. INTERVENTIONS: The infant was treated with supportive care, early macrolide antibiotics, and broad-spectrum antibiotics before being transferred to the PICU for further management, including continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the infant died as a result of pulmonary hypertension and multiorgan failure. LESSONS: Exchange transfusion should be considered in all infants who present with severe pertussis with hyperleukocytosis. This guideline is supported by the findings of a comprehensive literature review, which is included in this article, as well as newly published criteria for exchange transfusion therapy. Finally, we hope that adults in China will be vaccinated against B. pertussis in order to prevent the infection of infants within their households."

","SPECIES:Bordetella pertussisID:30097456TITLE:Could this be whooping cough?ABSTRACT:Whooping cough is a notifiable bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis It may produce serious disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals and very young children. The number of reported cases increases in the winter months and the incidence peaks every 4-5 years. However, this periodicity is variable and is inconsistent between different geographical regions. Bordetella pertussis infection (BPI) may be underdiagnosed because of its seasonality and the fact that clinical features may be indistinguishable from other respiratory disorders in the paediatric ED setting. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the period of infectivity but may not shorten the illness. This review discusses the epidemiology of the disease, its clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and the disposition of patients with BPI."

In 2016, the mortality rate from pneumonia was 16,476 deaths per 100,000, which was an 11% increase from the previous year. The aim of our study was to determine the distribution of the bacterial pathogens causing respiratory symptoms in different age groups over a 10-year period. Between January 2008 and September 2017, 1,861 specimens from 1,664 patients admitted to Dankook University Hospital with respiratory symptoms were examined. We used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect six bacterial pneumonia pathogens: Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We detected bacterial pneumonia pathogens in 1,281 (68.83%) specimens. Of the 1,709 pathogens detected, S. pneumoniae was the most common (48.57%; n = 830) followed by H. influenzae (40.08%; n = 685). Most infections were found among children younger than 10 years (92.69%; n = 1,584). Although S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen detected in all age groups, M. pneumoniae infection increased in prevalence with age (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of co-infection was also high among these patients (31.1%; n = 399), which peaked in 2015 (54.55%; n = 42/77). The prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in Cheonan, along with the proportion of co-infections among patients increased over the 10-year study period. The findings will aid the development of treatment and prevention guidelines."

Methods: Clinical data were taken from Shenzhen Children's Hospital with Bordetella pertussis infection and confirmed by culture or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal secretion from October 2013 to December 2015. Patients were divided into two groups, those with radiologically confirmed pneumonia in the course of their disease and those with not. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed and compared. T test, Rank sum test or chi square test were used for comparison between groups. Risk factors were analyzed by unconditional Logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 501 children hospitalized with Bordetella pertussis infection were included. Among them, 309 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia. The median age was 3 (2, 6) months. Symptoms were paroxysmal cough (n=252, 81.6%), tachypnea (n=69, 22.3%), and cyanosis (n=105, 34.0%). The time from onset of cough to radiologically confirmed pneumonia was between 1 and 66 days with a median of 9 (5.5, 15.0) days. The most common pathogen of coinfection was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)(20 cases). Macrolides were used in 306 cases for (8.2+-3.6) days. All cases showed significant improvement. There were more male children (62.1% (192/309) vs. 50.3% (95/189) , chi(2)=6.768, P=0.009), and more instances of comorbidities (13.3% (41/309) vs.5.8% (11/189) , chi(2)=6.957, P=0.008) in the pneumonia group than in the other. The age was younger (3 (2,6) vs.4 (2,6) months, Z=32.91, P=0.000) in pneumonia group than in the other. Male sex, younger age, and underlying disease were independent risk factors for pertussis-associated pneumonia (OR=1.648, 1.486, 2.695, P=0.008, 0.036, 0.005). Conclusions: Pneumonia, as a complication of pertussis, is very easy to see in hospitalized children. The duration of hospitalization is extensive. It is more likely to happen in children who are male, young, and having underlying diseases. Pneumonia is easy to occur in the first 2 weeks of the course of disease."

This study evaluated the level of diphtheria (DT) and pertussis (PT)-related antibodies among children with pneumonia in Ji'nan, China. METHODS: A total of 484 sera of children from 1 day to 13 years of age were collected from 2014 to 2015 in Ji'nan. Children with recent history of pertussis were excluded from this study. Anti-DT and PT IgG concentrations were measured by ELISA (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). RESULTS: Of the 484 subjects tested, the overall positivity rate of anti-DT IgG (&gt;=0.1 IU/ml) was 48.97%, and the highest positivity rate of anti-DT IgG (68.55%) and proportion with long term protection (23.27%) were observed in children aged 6 m- &lt; 3 y. For anti-PT IgG, 334 subjects (69.01%) had anti-PT IgG levels below the lower limit of detection (5 IU/ml). Even with detectable anti-PT antibodies, the majority (115/150, 76.67%) of them had antibody levels of 5- &lt; 40 IU/ml. The highest proportion of subjects with detectable anti-PT IgG (&gt;=5 IU/ml) was observed in children aged &lt; 6 m (44.36%), then the proportion continually decreased to 15.0% at 3 y- &lt; 6 y (chi2 = 24.05, p &lt; 0.0001). The highest positivity rate (&gt;=40 IU/ml) was only 8.27% in children aged &lt; 6 m. Subjects with an anti-PT IgG &gt;=100 IU/ml were observed in all the groups and there were no significant differences in the proportions of subjects with a level &gt;= 100 IU/ml among these age groups (chi2 = 2.572, p = 0.4624). A total of 5 subjects had anti-PT IgG &gt;=100 IU/ml (&gt;=1 years post pertussis vaccination) which was considered to be indicative of a recent pertussis infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated low antibody levels and protection against pertussis in our study population. The anti-PT IgG maintained a low level throughout all age groups, and even no immune responses were observed after the basic immunization and booster. Our study supported the need to reevaluate the immune response of DTP vaccine which was used in Shandong province after 2010."

However, if there is a co-infection, the symptoms often can be prolonged and occasionally can lead to severe respiratory complications. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old Japanese female, who had not been vaccinated for B. pertussis, developed a persistent productive cough which became vigorous, and occasionally caused difficulty breathing and vomiting. Since serum IgM to M. pneumoniae was positive and IgG to B. pertussis was significantly elevated, and there were no findings of pneumonia on a chest x-ray film, we made a diagnosis of acute bronchitis caused by B. pertussis with possible co-infection with M. pneumoniae. The use of garenoxacin, a quinolone derivative, failed to work; however, a macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin dramatically improved her symptoms shortly after its administration. CONCLUSIONS In this patient case, because of the lymphocyte-stimulatory nature of M. pneumoniae and B. pertussis, an increased immunological response was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the symptoms. The immunosuppressive effect of clarithromycin was considered to repress the increased lymphocyte activity, facilitating the remission of the disease."

Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment."

Pathogen-specific clinical symptoms are often lacking, and it is difficult to detect atypical pathogens by culture methods. The use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods enables testing for many pathogens simultaneously in a single analysis. Aim: To determine the role of atypical pathogens in children hospitalized with CAP. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted throughout a 2-year period from August 2015 to September 2017. It included 400 Egyptian children hospitalized with clinical diagnosis of CAP at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Sputum samples were collected from lower respiratory tract of all enrolled patients by mucus trap catheter for identification of Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia by using multiplex real-time PCR. Results: Among the 400 CAP patients enrolled in this study, atypical pathogens were detected in 12/400 (3%) patients. Bordetella pertussis was detected in 2% of cases, and it was responsible for CAP in 8/104 (7.69%) infants in the age stratum &lt;= 4 months; compared with pertussis-negative cases, pertussis-positive cases were younger and incompletely vaccinated (P values were 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1% of cases, all were among the age stratum &gt; 4 months &lt;= 59 months in 4/272 (1.47%) children. Conclusion: In early infancy, Bordetella pertussis causes a significant proportion of hospitalized CAP cases; all were &lt;= 4 months old and incompletely vaccinated. This finding could suggest the role of maternal immunization in developing countries."

Areas Covered: Pertussis in young infants is characterized by an afebrile cough illness with coryza, apnea, seizures, cyanosis, and emesis. Severe illness is associated with high leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, rapid respiratory and cardiac rates and pneumonia. Many routine intensive care treatment procedures are detrimental: these include steroids and nitric oxide. Preventative measures include: quarantine, prophylactic antimicrobial agents and immunizations of the mother to be with Tdap between 27 and 36 weeks gestation. Expert Opinion: Infants deaths are due to the irreversible pulmonary hypertension which is caused by aggregates of leukocytes in the small vessels in the lung. The leukocytosis with lymphocytosis is due to pertussis toxin. It can be treated by exchange blood transfusions. However for this to be successful it needs to be started before shock or organ failure has occurred. To prevent pertussis in young infants, attention needs to be directed to the diagnosis and treatment of pertussis in adolescents and adults. Also important are antimicrobial prophylaxis in the infant and the immunization of mothers to be with Tdap vaccine during all pregnancies."

In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1-59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41 8% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99 7% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31 7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10 6-97 3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6 4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3 2%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33 9%] of 56). Almost all cases (98 9%) and controls (98 0%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61 4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 57 3-65 6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27 3% (23 3-31 6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5 9% (3 9-8 3). Viruses were less common (54 5%, 95% CrI 47 4-61 5 vs 68 0%, 62 7-72 7) and bacteria more common (33 7%, 27 2-40 8 vs 22 8%, 18 3-27 6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31 1%, 95% CrI 28 4-34 2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus-enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes. FUNDING: Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation."

DESIGN: Review of published English literature between 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include young age, malnutrition, immunosuppression, tobacco smoke or air pollution exposure. Better methods for specimen collection and molecular diagnostics have improved microbiological diagnosis, indicating that pneumonia results from several organisms interacting. Induced sputum increases microbiologic yield for Bordetella pertussis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has been associated with pneumonia in high TB prevalence areas. The proportion of cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b has declined with new conjugate vaccines; Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae non-type b are the commonest bacterial pathogens; viruses are the most common pathogens. Effective interventions comprise antibiotics, oxygen and non-invasive ventilation. New vaccines have reduced severity and incidence of disease, but disparities exist in uptake. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia has decreased but a considerable preventable burden remains. Widespread implementation of available, effective interventions and development of novel strategies are needed."

We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of positive M. pneumoniae results in this population. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with suspected pertussis tested with a bacterial multiplex PCR (including Bordetella pertussis and M. pneumoniae) between June 2015 and March 2017. Medical records were reviewed to compare demographics, clinical presentations and outcomes of patients positive for M. pneumoniae with those positive for B. pertussis and those with negative results, using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1244 patients were included as follows: 56 (4.5%) with M. pneumoniae, 116 (9.3%) with B. pertussis and 1029 (82.7%) with negative results. Mean age was respectively 4.8 years, 6.5 years and 2.8 years (P &lt; 0.05). Children with M. pneumoniae were less likely to present with cardinal symptoms of pertussis such as paroxysmal cough [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.40) but were more likely to have fever (adjusted OR: 10.53, 95% CI: 3.54-39.49) and other nonspecific respiratory symptoms compared with children with B. pertussis. Children with M. pneumoniae had very similar clinical presentations to those with a negative PCR, but were more likely to have radiologically confirmed pneumonia (adjusted OR: 5.48, 95% CI: 2.96-9.99) and were less likely to be diagnosed with a concomitant viral infection (adjusted OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.07-0.99).

Acute bronchitis is a lower respiratory tract infection characterized by cough, with or without sputum production, lasting 1 to 3 weeks. It typically is viral. Testing for influenza should be obtained in patients at high risk of influenza complications. Antibiotics are not indicated in patients without chronic lung disease unless Bordetella pertussis infection is suspected. If pertussis is confirmed, macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed. Otherwise, symptom control and patient education are key to management. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of death in children and adults. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and imaging study results. Ultrasonography is more accurate than chest x-rays. Severity scoring systems are used to aid clinical judgement in selecting inpatient versus outpatient management. Antibiotics should be administered according to current guidelines. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are nosocomial infections with high mortality rates. Microorganisms responsible for HAP and VAP have high rates of resistance and vary based on geographic regions. Implementation of prevention protocols has decreased rates of VAP."

While pertussis vaccination coverage is high (>=90%) among infants in Botswana, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection affects nearly one-third of pregnancies. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical course of pertussis disease in a cohort of HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU), HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU), and HIV-infected infants with pneumonia in Botswana. METHODS: We recruited children 1-23 months of age with clinical pneumonia at a tertiary care hospital in Gaborone, Botswana between April 2012 and June 2016. We obtained nasopharyngeal swab specimens at enrollment and tested these samples using a previously validated in-house real-time PCR assay that detects a unique sequence of the porin gene of Bordetella pertussis. RESULTS: B. pertussis was identified in 1/248 (0.4%) HUU, 3/110 (2.7%) HEU, and 0/33 (0.0%) HIV-infected children. All pertussis-associated pneumonia cases occurred in infants 1-5 months of age (prevalence, 1.0% [1/103] in HUU and 4.8% [3/62] in HEU infants). No HEU infants with pertussis-associated pneumonia were taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis at the time of hospital presentation. One HUU infant with pertussis-associated pneumonia required intensive care unit admission for mechanical ventilation, but there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pertussis was low among infants and young children with pneumonia in Botswana. Although vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy is designed to prevent classical pertussis disease, reduction of pertussis-associated pneumonia might be an important additional benefit."

Clinical picture is difficult to differentiate between the B. pertussis and viral respiratory infections. METHODOLOGY: Eighty-five patients with the diagnosis of WCLRTI were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 involved patients with pertussis shown by nasopharyngeal aspirate culture (NAC) and/or PCR. Group 2 consisted of patients who B. pertussis was not detected by NAC however, clinicians still evaluated them as potential patients of pertussis. Group 3 involved patients with the diagnosis of WCLRTI and those with VRTI detected by antigen detection/PCR. RESULTS: Patients with pertussis had longer duration of the symptoms prior to admission. Paroxysmal cough, whooping, vomiting after coughing, cyanosis, apnea, seizures and abdominal hernias were more common in patients with pertussis. Fever, wheezing, tachypnea, retraction, fine crackles and rhonchi were more common in Group 3. Chest radiographs of patients in Group 3 revealed more bronchopneumonic infiltration, increased aeration, and atelectasis. CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were significantly higher in Group 3. Of the patients 43.6% had no pertussis vaccination due to being &lt; 2 months in age and 29.4% had 1 dose. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis should be thought in differential diagnosis of children with complaints of episodes of paroxysmal cough, cough accompanied by gasping, vomiting after coughing; with leukocytosis, lymphocytosis and a normal chest X-ray. The majority of children with pertussis infection are those who have not had the opportunity for vaccination."

We describe the first multicenter study of 445 respiratory samples, collected through the 2016-2017 and 2018 respiratory seasons, with performance compared against BioFire FilmArray RP v1.7 and discrepancy testing by Seegene Allplex RP. The QIAstat RP demonstrated a positive percentage of agreement of 98.0% (95% CI: 96.0-99.1%) and a negative percentage agreement of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.6-99.9%). With use of this comprehensive and rapid test, improved patient outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship may potentially be achieved."

The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics and the aetiological agent of pertussis-like syndrome (PLS) in Eastern China.Methods: 1168 patients who were diagnosed with a suspected Bordetella pertussis in Shanghai Children's Hospital from 2013 to 2017 were included in the study. Clinical features and aetiologies were analysed. Aetiological analyses in sub-cohorts of age, seasons and years were also investigated.Results: 96.0% (1121) of the patients were less than 12 months old. 59.0% (689) of the patients were male. The Top 5 pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n = 125; 10.7%), Streptococcus pneumonia (SP; n = 109; 9.3%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB; n = 86; 7.4%), Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis; n = 84; 7.2%), and Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP; n = 80; 6.9%), respectively. The percentage of SP in the age group of 0-3 months was significantly lower than that in other age groups. The percentage of B. pertussis in the age group of 3-6 months was significantly lower than that in the group of 6-12 months. The percentage of MP in 0-3 months' group was significantly lower than that in >12 months group. RSV peaked in winter (n = 52), while HIB peaked in spring (n = 38).Conclusion: PLS occurred most often in infants. RSV, SP, HIB, B. pertussis, and MP were the most prevalent pathogens. Since patients with B. pertussis and other pathogens have similar clinical manifestations, diagnosis of pertussis should be based on both clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmation."

Although its incidence has decreased substantially after the introduction of a vaccination, the burden of the disease remains high. Although the paroxysmal phase is highly disabling, complications are uncommon and more prevalent in children than in adults. The most frequent neurological complication is encephalopathy, but seizures, paresis, paraplegia, ataxias, aphasias, and decerebration postures have also been described. The complication of decerebration postures has not been previously reported in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a video case of an adult HIV patient with severe coughing paroxysms, post-tussive emesis and syncope, whose workup confirmed the diagnosis of a B. pertussis respiratory infection. During hospitalization, he had fluctuant encephalopathy and post-tussive decerebration postures following paroxysms. He was treated with antibiotic therapy and finally sent home without residual neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the biological plausibility of neurologic complications of pertussis in adults, which, albeit rare, can cause important morbidities. Future research should explore whether there are differences in the clinical presentation, risk factors and pathophysiology of the disease among adults or interventions aimed at preventing or treating pertussis encephalopathy."

Recent studies from around the world suggest that B. pertussis infections again follow a seasonal pattern with increased incidence in summer.The aim of this study was to investigate whether respiratory infections caused by B. pertussis in the period from January 2008 to December 2018 also seasonally spread in Germany and if so, when the B. pertussis activity peaked. METHODS: We tested 19,031 samples, mainly from Southern Germany, collected in the period from January 2008 to December 2018 using a Multiplex PCR assay. We assessed the number and proportion of samples positive for B. pertussis, stratified by patient's age and month. The seasonal distribution was investigated by plotting the average proportion of positive samples for each month. RESULTS: We observed a B. pertussis seasonality with the highest number of positive samples in the months from June until September. In contrast, testing of samples for B. pertussis was requested most frequently in the period from October until March. The proportion of positive samples increased earlier in adolescents (age 10 to 19) than in other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found a seasonality of B. pertussis infections in Germany, which differs from the time when most samples are sent in for testing of B. pertussis. Our study suggests that clinicians should be more aware of B. pertussis infections in the months from June until September to prevent further transmission to vulnerable family members."

Most low and middle-income countries (LMIC) lack resources for laboratory confirmation, relying largely on clinical diagnosis alone for both case management and surveillance. This necessitates robust clinical case definitions. OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the accuracy of clinical case definitions with and without lymphocytosis in diagnosing pertussis in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in a LMIC setting. METHODS: Children hospitalized with severe LRTI in a South African hospital were prospectively enrolled and evaluated for pertussis using PCR on respiratory samples. Clinical signs and differential white cell counts were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of pertussis clinical diagnosis using WHO and Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) criteria; and with addition of lymphocytosis were assessed with PCR as the reference standard. RESULTS: 458 children <10 years were enrolled. Bordetella pertussis infection was confirmed in 32 (7.0%). For WHO criteria, sensitivity was 78.1% (95% CI 60.7-89.2%) and specificity 15.5% (95% CI 12.4-19.3%); for GPI sensitivity was 34.4% (95% CI 20.1-52.1) and specificity 64.8% (95% CI 60.1-69.2%). Area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating character (ROC) analysis was 0.58 (95% CI 0.46-0.70 for WHO criteria, and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.88) for GPI with highest likelihood ratios of 5.33 and 4.42 respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was highest between five and seven days of symptoms for both criteria. Lymphocytosis had sensitivity of 31.3% (95% CI 17.5-49.3%) and specificity of 70.7% (95% CI 66.1-74.8%) and showed a marginal impact on improving clinical criteria. CONCLUSION: Clinical criteria lack accuracy for diagnosis and surveillance of pertussis. Non-outbreak settings should consider shorter durations in clinical criteria. New recommendations still fall short of what is required for a viable clinical screening test which means the need to improve access to laboratory diagnostic support remains crucial."

Vaccination has been crucial to annual reductions in the number of cases. However, disease reemergence has occurred over the last decade in several countries, including Brazil. Here we describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of suspected pertussis cases in Salvador, Brazil, and evaluate factors associated with case confirmation. This descriptive and retrospective study was conducted in the five hospitals in Salvador that reported the highest number of pertussis cases between 2011-2016. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for each patient. Bivariate analysis was performed to evaluate differences between groups (confirmed vs. unconfirmed cases) using Pearson's Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Of 529 suspected pertussis cases, 29.7% (157/529) were confirmed by clinical, clinical-epidemiological or laboratory criteria, with clinical criteria most frequently applied (63.7%; 100/157). Unvaccinated individuals (43.3%; 68/157) were the most affected, followed by age groups 2-3 months (37.6%; 59/157) and <2 months (31.2%; 49/157). Overall, <=50% of the confirmed cases presented a complete vaccination schedule. All investigated cases presented cough in association with one or more symptoms, especially paroxysmal cough (66.9%; 105/529) (p = 0.001) or cyanosis (66.2%; 104/529) (p<0.001). Our results indicate that pertussis occurred mainly in infants and unvaccinated individuals in Salvador, Brazil. The predominance of clinical criteria used to confirm suspected cases highlights the need for improvement in the laboratory tools used to perform rapid diagnosis. Fluctuations in infection prevalence demonstrate the importance of vaccination strategies in improving the control and prevention of pertussis."

Evidence indicates that Bordetella pertussis has an important role in the aetiology of LRTI. We aimed to study the association between B. pertussis and other respiratory pathogens in children hospitalised with severe LRTI, and to assess clinical relevance of co-detection. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and induced sputa (IS) were tested with a B. pertussis specific PCR; additionally, IS was tested for other pathogens using a multiplex PCR. We included 454 children, median age 8 months (IQR 4-18), 31 (7%) of whom tested positive for B. pertussis. Children with B. pertussis had more bacterial pathogens detected (3 versus 2; P < 0.001). While B. pertussis showed no association with most pathogens, it was independently associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and parainfluenza viruses with adjusted risk ratios of 4.01 (1.03-15.64), 4.17 (1.42-12.27) and 2.13 (1.03-4.55), respectively. There was a consistent increased risk of severe disease with B. pertussis. Patterns indicated even higher risks when B. pertussis was co-detected with any of the three organisms although not statistically significant. Improving vaccine coverage against B. pertussis would impact not only the incidence of pertussis but also that of severe LRTI generally."

The paradox pertaining to children being the least affected by severe illness poses exciting opportunities to investigate potential protective factors. In this paper, we propose that childhood vaccination against pertussis (whooping cough) might play a non-specific protective role against COVID-19 through heterologous adaptive responses in this young population. Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease of the respiratory tract and it shares many similarities with COVID-19 including transmission and clinical features. Although pertussis is caused by a bacterium (Bordetella pertussis) while COVID-19 is a viral infection (SARS-CoV-2), previous data showed that cross-reactivity and heterologous adaptive responses can be seen with unrelated agents of highly divergent groups, such as between bacteria and viruses. While we build the arguments of this hypothesis on theoretical and previous empirical evidence, we also outline suggested lines of research from different fields to test its credibility. Besides, we highlight some concerns that may arise when attempting to consider such an approach as a potential public health preventive intervention against COVID-19."

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization especially in children < 2 year-old. Although the clinical findings are different in these two diseases, it is sometimes difficult to make this distinction in partially or fully vaccinated children. This study aimed to identify the incidence, clinical and laboratory effects of B. pertussis as a causative agent in hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: The study included patients diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis and admitted to the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases from January 2012 to December 2015, aged 24 months or younger, evaluated for viruses and bacteria with polymerase chain reaction in respiratory tract secretions. RESULTS: The study included 380 patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. Of these patients, 85.8% were identified to be positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. The most commonly identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, bocavirus and metapneumovirus A/B. B. pertussis was only detected in 5 patients (1.5%). In the patients with B. pertussis identified, coinfection with another virus was observed including rhinovirus (n= 2), influenza A virus (n= 1), coronavirus OC43 (n= 1) and RSV A/B (n= 1). The presence of B. pertussis did not appear to cause any significant clinical or laboratory differences in patients. CONCLUSIONS: B. pertussis is a rare pathogen in patients admitted to hospital for acute bronchiolitis. However, in patients who do not respond to standard bronchiolitis treatment, B. pertussis should be considered as a causative agent. Early identification of this pathogen is important in terms of quarantining the patient, administering appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and prophylactic treatment to household and other close contacts."

A retrospective study was performed during a five-year period (2008-2011, 2014-2016). Respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria were studied using the FilmArray-Respiratory Panel. Demographic and clinical characteristics, hospitalization course and outcomes were evaluated. Of the 137 infants <2 months old hospitalized with ARI studied, a 94.9% positivity rate as determined in 117 infants with community-acquired infection and 20.0% in 20 infants who acquired the infection during their birth hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) (nosocomial ARI) (p<0.001). In infants with community-acquired infection, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (52.1%) and Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RV/EV) (41.0%) were the most frequent detected pathogens. Coinfections were determined in one quarter of the infants, RSV-RV/EV being the most frequent combination. In infants with nosocomial infection, RV/EV, RSV or Parainfluenza-3 were detected as single pathogens. Most infants with community-acquired infection presented lower ARI (81.2%) while most infants in the NICU had upper ARI (55.0%). The median length of stay (LOS) in infants with community-acquired ARI was 4 days (IQR: 2-6). Positive infants with nosocomial infection had longer median LOS (71 days [IQR:42-99]) compared to negative infants (58 days [IQR: 49-71]) (p=0.507). Respiratory viruses were detected as the major causative agents of community-acquired infection in hospitalized infants <2-months old, RSV and RV/EV being the most frequently detected.

Our study explored risk factors for death from severe pertussis. METHOD: A case-control study of infants with severe pertussis admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China, from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2019, was conducted. Pertussis was confirmed by clinical features and laboratory examinations. Severe pertussis was defined as patients with pertussis resulting in PICU admission or death. To understand the risk factors for death, we compared fatal and nonfatal cases of severe pertussis in infants aged < 120 days by collecting clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: The participants included 63 infants < 120 days of age with severe pertussis. Fifteen fatal cases were confirmed and compared with 44 nonfatal severe pertussis cases, Four patients with termination of treatment were excluded. In the univariate analysis, the risk factors associated with death included apnoea (P = 0.001), leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count>=30 x 109/L (P = 0.001) or >= 50 x 109/L (P = 0)), highest lymphocyte count (P = 0), pulmonary hypertension (P = 0.001), and length of PICU stay (P = 0.003). The multivariate analysis revealed that apnoea (OR 23.722, 95%CI 2.796-201.26, P = 0.004), leukocytosis (OR 63.708, 95%CI 3.574-1135.674, P = 0.005) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 26.109, 95%CI 1.800-378.809, P = 0.017) were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSION: Leukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension exhibited the greatest associations with death in infants with severe pertussis admitted to the PICU.

METHODS: Children < 24 months of age hospitalized with LRTI were prospectively enrolled from January 2017 to December 2019. Demographic and clinical information were recorded, and respiratory tract samples were tested for the presence of B. pertussis and ten common viruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Bordetella pertussis PCR was positive in 6.1% (202/4287) of the patients. Only 146 (72.3%) B. pertussis infections met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition for pertussis. Among the 202 subjects with B. pertussis infections, 81 (40.1%) were coinfected with at least 1 respiratory virus, with human rhinovirus being the most commonly detected virus (25.7%). No differences in clinical severity were observed between children with single B. pertussis infection and those with virus coinfection [odds ratio (OR) 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.44]. However, children with virus coinfection were significantly more likely to present with radiologically confirmed pneumonia than those with a single B. pertussis infection (OR 2.62; CI 1.39-4.91).

Comprehensive, multiplex respiratory pathogen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels (RPPs) have recently become popular, but their utility in excluding pertussis infection has not been fully explored. OBJECTIVES: To determine RPP testing results for pertussis using frozen banked samples that previously tested positive on dedicated Bordetella pertussis PCR testing, and to describe positive test rates for other respiratory pathogens on these samples via RPP. METHODS: Our microbiology laboratory retrieved banked nasopharyngeal samples from inpatient, ambulatory, and emergency department sources that were positive for pertussis using B. pertussis PCR testing from March 2015 to October 2017. RPP was performed on thawed, archived samples. Rate of pertussis identification on RPP was determined, and positive tests for other pathogens were tabulated. RESULTS: A total of 3482 specimens were submitted for pertussis PCR testing during the study period. Of those, 138 (4%) were positive for B. pertussis, and 102 (74%) samples were banked and available for RPP testing. Fifty-seven of 102 (56%) of the banked samples had positive RPP testing for pertussis. Of the 45 samples negative for pertussis on RPP testing, 20 (44%) tested positive for other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSION: Negative testing for B. pertussis and positive testing for other respiratory pathogens on RPP was common in samples that previously tested positive on dedicated B. pertussis PCR testing, both of which could lead to missed diagnoses of pertussis infection. Clinicians should consider using dedicated pertussis PCR testing if pertussis infection is suspected."

METHODS: B. pertussis infection was studied by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) in 49 infants < 12 months of age, who were admitted for lower respiratory tract infections during the winter season. Seven other possible viral pathogens were documented by antigen detection or PCR in NPSs. The clinical feature of infants with mixed infection of B. pertussis and respiratory viruses were examined. RESULTS: Overall, B. pertussis infection was found in 10 (20.4%) cases, nine were less than 6 months of age and seven were unvaccinated. Viral etiology was found in 41 (84%) cases and pertussis-viral co-infection was present in eight patients, five of whom had mixed infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Only the presence of staccato coughing, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis were significantly different in B. pertussis-positive cases compared with B. pertussis-negative cases. Of the 10 pertussis cases, only the culture-positive cases showed the typical symptoms and laboratory findings of pertussis in addition to virus-associated respiratory symptoms with severe hospital course, whereas cases identified as DNA-positive lacked the characteristics of pertussis and their clinical severities were the same as B. pertussis-negative cases.

Physicians may overprescribe antimicrobials owing to the concern of bacterial infections, including those because of atypical pathogens. We investigated the accuracy of clinical predictions concerning atypical pathogen infections. Methods: We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented with a fever and cough in outpatient clinics between December 2016 and August 2018. After taking a history and performing physical examinations, physicians predicted the possibility of respiratory infections because of atypical pathogens. Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: >=50%, intermediate: 20% >= and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. Results: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3-39.2) were associated with the detections.

In addition, the occurrence of two important bacterial causes of lower respiratory illness (Bordetella pertussis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) is increasing. This review focuses on current information on the prophylaxis, treatment, and diagnosis of these agents. Finally, consideration is given to infections in immunocompromised children: the effects of respiratory syncytial virus infections in immunosuppressed transplant patients, and prevention and diagnosis of opportunistic infections (including Pneumocystis carinii) in children with human immunodeficiency virus."

METHODS: A retrospective review of all deaths attributed to pertussis with disease onset during 1992 and 1993 reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospital discharge summaries and autopsy reports were reviewed, and additional clinical information was provided by physicians involved in the care of the children. RESULTS: During 1992 and 1993, 23 deaths attributed to pertussis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cultures for Bordetella pertussis were positive in 18 (90%) of the 20 cases in which it was performed. Twenty (87%) of the 23 children who died were young than 1 year of age, and 18 (78%) of the children had received no doses orf pertussis vaccine. Among 20 children for whom gestational ages were known, 12 (60%) were born at36 weeks' gestation or earlier; in contrast, 10.7% of live births in the United States in 1992 were at 36 weeks' gestation or earlier. The median age of mothers whose children had fatal pertussis was 20 (range, 14 to 37) years in the 15 cases in which ages were known, compared with the national median age of 26.3 years in 1992. Pneumonia was a complication in all but 1 (96%) of the cases. Seizures occurred in 4 cases (17%), and acute encephalopathy occurred in 3 cases (13%). CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis continues to cause serious illness and death in the United States, particularly among infants who are not vaccinated. Preterm delivery and young maternal age may place infants at increased risk of death because of pertussis. Under the current pertussis vaccination schedule, three fourths of the infants who died were too young to have received three doses of pertussis vaccine, the minimum number of doses considered necessary for adequate protection against clinical pertussis. Additional strategies, to prevent deaths caused by pertussis in young infants, such as starting infant vaccination at an earlier age and booster doses to adolescents and adults, need to be evaluated."

It is important to be acquainted with new causes of infection which include Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, diphtheroids in certain instances (Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum), and viruses such as the Hanta strains. Infections with Bordetella pertussis are increasing. However, the ever present and most common cause of CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae, continues to present problems because of increasing antibiotic resistance, the high case fatality rate when bacteremia accompanies pneumonia, and the inability to give prophylactic immunization to all people with risk factors for this infection."

OBJECTIVES: This prospective observational study is an etiological survey of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) over a 12-month period in the Iranian city of Mashhad. To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective hospital-based studies to comprehensively evaluate the epidemiological, demographical, clinical, and prognostic factors of patients with CAP in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied all adult patients (aged &gt;= 16 years) with CAP admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, between February 2013 and January 2014. The etiological diagnosis of CAP was made through conventional culturing and staining of respiratory secretions (i.e. sputum and pleural fluid), standard BACTEC  Plus Aerobic/F bottles for blood cultures, and the immunochromatographic assays BinaxNOW( ) Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen and BinaxNOW( ) Legionella pneumophila antigen for the detection of S. pneumoniae antigen and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen, respectively. RESULTS: Among 120 patients with CAP, the most common etiology was S. pneumoniae (24.4%), followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (17.5%), S. aureus (6.7%), polymicrobial agents including anaerobes (4.2%), complicated hydatid cyst (2.5%), Influenza A virus (4.2%; including 2 cases of mixed Influenza A-bacterial infection), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Brucella melitensis, Mucor, and varicella, each in 0.8% of the patients. The diagnosis of pneumonia remained unknown in 49 (40%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis was an important cause of CAP in our region.

Areas covered: We conducted a systematic search of scientific reports of brucellosis with pulmonary involvement published from January 1985 to July 2016. Four main patterns of disease were observed: pneumonia, pleural effusion, nodules and interstitial pattern. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms. Brucella spp. culture was obtained from blood (50%) or pleural fluid. Treatment is based on the same antibiotics and combinations of antibiotics as for patients with acute no complicated brucellosis. The most frequent antimicrobial combination was doxycycline and rifampin for six weeks. The clinical course was favorable in most reports, and mortality was remarkably low (&lt;1%). Expert commentary: Non-specific clinical and radiological manifestations were the main reason for the delay in proper treatment. Difficulty in distinguishing Brucellosis from other pulmonary infections, such as tuberculosis, sometimes posed an added diagnostic challenge."

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-month-old child was referred to our hospital with a 3-week history of fevers and cough. He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: Conventional antibiotic treatment was ineffectual. Total leukocyte count was 10,300/mm, hemoglobin was 8.5 g/dL, and platelet count was 250,000/mm. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and procaicltonin were 25 mm/h and 0.12 ng/mL, respectively. Chest radiography showed pneumonic infiltrate in both lungs.The initial bacteriologic test results were negative. Ten days after admission, Brucella melitensis were isolated from the second blood culture. This child was cured with the 2-drug regimen (rifampin+trimethopicin-sulfamethoxazole) for 6 weeks. OUTCOMES: The child recovered well with no occurrence of complications. The child remained asmptomatic without any signs or symptoms at a follow-up of 1 year. LESSONS: Non-specific findings of pulmonary brucellosis in children often make diagnosis difficult. The second blood culture is essential. In endemic areas, children with fevers and cough should be included in the diagnosis in cases of pulmonary brucellosis."

Unique or sequential Burkholderia isolates (n=48) that had been collected from eight CF children and 17 adults over several (4-6) years were investigated; moreover 11 reference strains were analyzed. METHODS: The microorganisms were identified by using biochemical methods, genotyped by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random-amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting-PCR (RAPD-PCR), and assessed by PCR assays for the genomovar and cblA and esmR genes of Bcc. RESULTS: Among isolates 70.8% were identified as Bcc genomovar III-A; one child was infected by Burkholderia ambifaria and four adults were colonized with Burkholderia gladioli. The cblA gene was not detected in any of the isolates, while the esmR gene was detected in the 52.1% of the strains, all belonging to genomovar III-A. CONCLUSION: Molecular analysis of strains revealed in CF patients a colonization with a persistent Burkholderia flora with strains of one genotype. The prevalence of Bcc of genomovar III-A in the two categories of patients and of B. gladioli in four adults demonstrated that transmission may have occurred between subjects.

Within bacterial classification (taxonomy), B. cepacia gathers eight species and one species on standby of nomenclature (genomovar VI); the whole of these species constitutes the ""B. cepacia complex"" or B. cepacia ""sensu lato"" and the denomination B. cepacia ""sensu stricto"" is attributed to the genomovar I.

In 2005, we investigated a multistate outbreak of Burkholderia cenocepacia associated with an intrinsically contaminated alcohol-free mouthwash (AFM). METHODS: We conducted a case-series investigation. We used repetitive extragenic palindromic- polymerase chain reaction typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to characterize available Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) isolates from patients and implicated AFM. Seeding studies were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the AFM. RESULTS: Of the 116 patients with Bcc infection or colonization identified from 22 hospitals with culture dates from April 7 through August 31, 2005, 105 had infections or colonizations that were due to B cenocepacia. The median age of these 105 patients was 64 years (range, 6 to 94 years), 52% were women, 55% had evidence of infection, and 2 patients died. Of 139 patient culture specimens, 83 (60%) were from the respiratory tract. Among 103 Bcc patient isolates characterized, 81 (76%) had an indistinguishable PFGE pattern compared to the outbreak strain cultured from implicated lots of unopened AFM; the species was B cenocepacia. Seeding studies showed that the contaminated AFM might have had inadequate amounts of the antimicrobial agent cetylpyridinium chloride. CONCLUSIONS: This intrinsically contaminated AFM led to a geographically dispersed outbreak of B cenocepacia. AFM without therapeutic label claims is regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration as a cosmetic rather than a drug and is therefore subject to limited quality control requirements. Clinicians should be aware that AFM is not sterile. Its use in intubated and other patients with increased risk of aspiration should be avoided."

Infection with Burkholderia species is typically considered a contraindication to transplantation in CF. However, the risks posed by different Burkholderia species on transplantation outcomes are poorly defined. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the risks of infection with Burkholderia species on survival before and after lung transplantation in patients with CF. METHODS: Multivariate Cox survival models assessed hazard ratios of infection with Burkholderia species in 1,026 lung transplant candidates and 528 lung transplant recipients. Lung allocation scores, incorporating Burkholderia infection status, were calculated for transplant candidates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Transplant candidates infected with different Burkholderia species did not have statistically different mortality rates. Among transplant recipients infected with B. cenocepacia, only those infected with nonepidemic strains had significantly greater post-transplant mortality compared with uninfected patients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-6.12; P = 0.04). Hazards were similar between uninfected transplant recipients and those infected with B. multivorans (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.27-1.56; P = 0.34). Transplant recipients infected with B. gladioli had significantly greater post-transplant mortality than uninfected patients (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.05-4.74; P = 0.04). Once hazards for species/strain were included, lung allocation scores of B. multivorans-infected transplant candidates were comparable to uninfected candidate scores, whereas those of candidates infected with nonepidemic B. cenocepacia or B. gladioli were lower. CONCLUSIONS: Post-transplant mortality among patients with CF infected with Burkholderia varies by infecting species.

The key bacterial determinants associated with this poor clinical outcome in CF patients are not clear. In this study, the cytotoxicity and procoagulant activity of B. cenocepacia from the ET-12 lineage, that has been linked to the cepacia syndrome, and four clinical isolates recovered from CF patients with mild clinical courses were analysed in both in vitro and in vivo assays. METHODS: B. cenocepacia-infected BEAS-2B epithelial respiratory cells were used to investigate the bacterial cytotoxicity assessed by the flow cytometric detection of cell staining with propidium iodide. Bacteria-induced procoagulant activity in cell cultures was assessed by a colorimetric assay and by the flow cytometric detection of tissue factor (TF)-bearing microparticles in cell culture supernatants. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from intratracheally infected mice were assessed for bacterial proinflammatory and procoagulant activities as well as for bacterial cytotoxicity, by the detection of released lactate dehydrogenase. RESULTS: ET-12 was significantly more cytotoxic to cell cultures but clinical isolates Cl-2, Cl-3 and Cl-4 exhibited also a cytotoxic profile. ET-12 and CI-2 were similarly able to generate a TF-dependent procoagulant environment in cell culture supernatant and to enhance the release of TF-bearing microparticles from infected cells. In the in vivo assay, all bacterial isolates disseminated from the mice lungs, but Cl-2 and Cl-4 exhibited the highest rates of recovery from mice livers. Interestingly, Cl-2 and Cl-4, together with ET-12, exhibited the highest cytotoxicity. All bacteria were similarly capable of generating a procoagulant and inflammatory environment in animal lungs. CONCLUSION: B. cenocepacia were shown to exhibit cytotoxic and procoagulant activities potentially implicated in bacterial dissemination into the circulation and acute pulmonary decline detected in susceptible CF patients. Improved understanding of the mechanisms accounting for B. cenocepacia-induced clinical decline has the potential to indicate novel therapeutic strategies to be included in the care B. cenocepacia-infected patients."

Burkholderia cenocepacia has been the focus of attention because initially it was the most common Bcc species isolated from patients with CF in North America and Europe. Today, B. cenocepacia, along with Burkholderia multivorans, is the most prevalent Bcc species in patients with CF. Given the progress that has been made in our understanding of B. cenocepacia over the past decade, we thought that it was an appropriate time to review our knowledge of the pathogenesis of B. cenocepacia, paying particular attention to the characterization of virulence determinants and the new tools that have been developed to study them. A common theme emerging from these studies is that B. cenocepacia establishes chronic infections in immunocompromised patients, which depend more on determinants mediating host niche adaptation than those involved directly in host cells and tissue damage."

The clinical manifestations of BCC infection are varied but can include cepacia syndrome, which is a rapidly progressing necrotising pneumonia with an almost universally fatal outcome. We report the case of a 38 year old man, known to have chronic infection with the ET12 strain of Burkholderia cenocepacia who developed cepacia syndrome 26 years after initial infection. Aggressive treatment with a combination of 4 intravenous antibiotics, oral corticosteroids and cyclosporin brought about clinical, radiological and biochemical resolution of his cepacia syndrome. This case highlights the possible role of cyclosporin in the treatment of cepacia syndrome."

Bcc bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment and are recognized as serious opportunistic pathogens that are virtually impossible to eradicate from the CF lung, posing a serious clinical threat. The epidemiological survey of Bcc bacteria involved in respiratory infections at the major Portuguese CF Treatment Center at Santa Maria Hospital, in Lisbon, has been carried out by our research group for the past 16 years, covering over 500 clinical isolates where B. cepacia and B. cenocepacia are the predominant species, with B. stabilis, B. contaminans, B. dolosa, and B. multivorans also represented. The systematic and longitudinal study of this CF population during such an extended period of time represents a unique case-study, comprehending 41 Bcc-infected patients (29 pediatric and 12 adult) of whom around 70% have been persistently colonized between 7 months and 9 years. During chronic infection, the CF airways represent an evolving ecosystem, with multiple phenotypic variants emerging from the clonal population and becoming established in the patients' airways as the result of genetic adaptation. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms involved is crucial for an improved therapeutic outcome of chronic infections in CF. This review focuses on our contribution to the understanding of these adaptive mechanisms based on extensive phenotypic, genotypic, and genome-wide expression approaches of selected Bcc clonal variants obtained during long-term colonization of the CF airways."

During 18 years of epidemiological surveillance in the major Portuguese CF centre in Lisbon, only one patient was infected with B. dolosa. Pulmonary deterioration, associated with the evolution of forced expiratory volume in 1 s, occurred during 5.5 years of colonization with this B. dolosa clone (with the new sequence type ST-668). Transient co-colonization with Burkholderia cenocepacia and other bacterial and fungal pathogens occurred, but B. dolosa prevailed until the patient's death. The systematic assessment of relevant phenotypes for the sequential clonal isolates examined in this retrospective study (14 of B. dolosa and four of B. cenocepacia) showed that they were variants, although in general no isolation time-dependent pattern of alteration was identified. However, the first B. dolosa isolate retrieved was more susceptible to gentamicin, imipenem and tobramycin, and exhibited a higher swarming motility compared with most of the isolates obtained during the later stages of disease progression and antimicrobial therapy."

A 24-year-old white woman who had cystic fibrosis presented with respiratory failure caused by B. Cenocepacia pneumonia. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and a double-lung transplant. The chest cavity and both bronchi were irrigated with 0.5% povidone-iodine solution. For immunosuppression, she received induction therapy with alemtuzumab (15 mg) and methylprednisolone and maintenance therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone (5 mg daily). Postoperative antibiotics included intravenous meropenem for 3 weeks; vancomycin for 10 days; and inhaled ceftazidime, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline for several months. Follow-up at 25 months after transplant showed that chest radiographs were clear and lung function was normal. At 6 years after transplant, she was working full time and had no recurrence of infection from B. Cenocepacia. This case suggests that patients who have cystic fibrosis and active B.

BCC isolates were identified to the species level by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system and by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Sequencing of the recA gene in the 54 blood isolates revealed 37 (68.5%) isolates of B. cenocepacia, 9 (16.7%) of B. cepacia, 4 (7.4%) of B. multivorans and one isolate each of B. arboris, B. pseudomultivorans, B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis. The overall performance of the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system for correctly identifying the 54 BCC isolates to the species level was 79.6%, which was better than that (16.7%) by 16S RNA sequencing analysis. Bacteraemic pneumonia (n = 23, 42.6%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (n = 21, 38.9%) were the most common types of infection. Higher rates of ceftazidime and meropenem resistance were found in B. cepacia isolates (33.3% and 22.2%, respectively) than in isolates of B. cenocepacia (21.6% and 10.8%, respectively) and other species (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively). Overall, the 30-day mortality rate was 38.9% (21/54).

We report the case of a young adult CF patient chronically colonized by B multivorans genomovar II, with diabetes and end-stage renal disease treated with renal replacement therapy: a few months after lung transplantation, she developed post-surgery B multivorans bacteremia and multiple brain abscesses. This severe infection did not improve despite multiple standard antibiotic regimen.

METHODS: Over a 72-day period, a multidisciplinary ICU team detected two distinct periods of high and unusual incidence of Bcc isolates that were recovered from cultures of endotracheal aspirate. Cultures of tap water, ultrasound gel and mouthwash (opened and unopened bottles) were performed. Bcc was identified with the BD-Phoenix  and MALDI-TOF MS systems, with molecular typing using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) technique. RESULTS: In both outbreak 1 (6 patients) and outbreak 2 (5 patients), the point sources of Bcc were chlorhexidine mouthwashes of two different brands, both of them intrinsically contaminated. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and 6 died. MALDI-TOF MS identified 2 species of Bcc (B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia). ERIC-PCR typing confirmed 100% genetic similarity between patient and mouthwash isolates from each period. The first outbreak was controlled in 20 days and the second in 6 days.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the changing epidemiology and clinical outcomes associated with Burkholderia species infections in persons with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: A cohort study of children and adults with CF was conducted from 1997 - 2018 in Toronto, Canada. Patients were characterised as having no history of Burkholderia species infection and those who were culture-positive for Burkholderia spp. for the first time in this time frame, categorized by species (B. gladioli, B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans or other) and strain (B. cenocepacia ET-12). Cox models were used to estimate risk of death or transplantation. Mixed effects models were used to assess impact of Burkholderia species on odds of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and effect on lung function (FEV1% predicted). RESULTS: A total of 1196 patients were followed over 20 years; 88 patients (7.4%) had >= 1 culture positive for Burkholderia species. Patients with ET-12 infection had a median time to death of 1.95 years compared to 5.30-6.72 years for those with other Burkholderia infections. ET-12 infection was associated with a greater risk of death or transplantation compared to patients with no history of Burkholderia infection in a univariate model (HR 3.92, 95% CI 2.25 - 6.81) but was no longer significant after adjusting for confounders. PEx were more common in those with Burkholderia infections and remained significant in the ET-12 group after adjusting for confounders (OR 2.96 (1.17 - 7.53)). No differences were noted in baseline FEV1% or the rate of FEV1% decline between the groups with and without Burkholderia species infection. CONCLUSION: With the exception of ET-12, acquisition of Burkholderia species infection did not appear to worsen clinical outcomes compared to those with no history of infection. Given this, prognosis, management and clinical trial inclusion protocols may need to be re-evaluated for persons with Burkholderia infection."

There were no differences between the levels of the inflammation markers measured in the three groups (P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia, B. cepacia intermittent) at any of the assessment points. When clinically stable, levels of inflammatory markers in all groups were elevated compared to a matched non-CF population, indicating, continuous inflammation and the potential for lung damage between infective exacerbations. This study does not support the hypothesis that pulmonary colonization with Burkholderia cepacia is associated with a heightened inflammatory response compared with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization."

In all patients, the pulmonary infiltrates initially were localized (right middle lobe, left upper lobe, and right middle lobe) but rapidly progressed. Two open-lung biopsies and one pneumonectomy specimen showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation merging with areas of more conventional necrotizing bronchopneumonia In one patient, a mediastinal lymph node also showed stellate necrotizing granulomas. Vasculitis was absent. B. cepacia was cultured from the open-lung biopsies and bronchial wash specimens in two patients and from postmortem cultures of lung, subcarinal lymph nodes, and blood in the third. The histopathology in these patients resembles that of melioidosis, which is caused by a related organism, Burkholderia pseudomallei. B. cepacia needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, given the rarity with which B. cepacia is identified as a cause of pneumonia in the immunocompetent host, isolation of B. cepacia should trigger a workup for underlying immunodeficiency or lead to an investigation to exclude the possibility of a nosocomial infection."

DESIGN: Prospective program for the surveillance of antibiotic susceptibilities of microorganisms responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia. SETTING: Academic, university-based, medical intensive care unit (16 beds). SUBJECTS: 2,856 mechanically ventilated patients. INTERVENTIONS: A new program of antibiotic use was introduced at the end of 1996 that involved the rotation of antibiotics in empirical and therapeutic use of the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The rotation concerned the beta-lactam and aminoglycoside classes, with a rotation interval of 1 month. The use of antibiotics was monitored monthly. No preference was given to any particular antibiotic. In a previous study, the period before the introduction of this protocol (1995-1996) was compared with the period 2 yrs after (1997-1998): The results indicated a decreased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, a lower incidence of potentially resistant Gram-negative bacilli, and increased sensitivities of Gram-negative bacilli, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. After 1998, we decided to continue a routine for this rotation. The long-term effect of this program was studied by comparing the incidence of Gram-negative bacilli responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia and their susceptibilities obtained in a third period: 1999-2001. The long-term effect (5 yrs) of such a strategy-2-yr protocol period (1997-1998) and 3-yr routine period (1999-2001)-could be evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the 7-yr study period, 2,856 patients were mechanically ventilated for &gt;48 hrs. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia remained significantly lower in period 3 (1999-2001): 23% (period 1, 1995-1996) vs. 15.7% (period 2, 1997-1998) vs. 16.3% (period 3, 1999-2001; p =.002). Late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 86.6% and 94% of cases, respectively, in periods 1 and 3 (p =.02). The decrease of the incidence of early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia was statistically significant during the 7-yr study period: 13% vs. 9% vs. 5.9% (p =.02). Combined with a higher incidence of late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia, the incidence of potentially resistant Gram-negative bacilli increased in period 3: 42.2% vs. 34.5% vs. 41.7% (nonsignificant), except for B. cepacia: 11.7% vs. 7.4% vs. 3.7% (p =.005). Nevertheless, the potential antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were more sensitive to most of the beta-lactams, especially piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. CONCLUSIONS: Rotation of antibiotics could help to avoid ventilator-associated pneumonia. It could greatly improve the susceptibilities of the potentially antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli responsible for late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia. This program could be applied in routine with good results 5 yrs after its introduction. Further studies, especially multiple-center trials, are necessary to confirm this result and better define the rotation type and intervals."

Patients experience infections, predominantly caused by catalase-positive bacteria and fungal organisms, that may be severe and life-threatening. Most cases of CGD are diagnosed in children; however, it may rarely go undiagnosed until adulthood in individuals with unexplained infections and granulomatous inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To describe an adult with Crohn disease and recurrent infections who was newly diagnosed as having CGD. METHODS: A 53-year-old woman with a history of liver abscesses and Crohn disease presented with Burkholderia cepacia pneumonia and required a right middle lobe resection. Nitroblue tetrazolium test results confirmed the diagnosis of CGD, and Western blot analysis revealed the absence of the 47-phagocyte oxidase protein. Levels of Crohn-associated specific antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C were elevated. RESULTS: The patient, newly diagnosed as having CGD, was given intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, after which she improved clinically and was discharged from the hospital in stable condition to receive daily oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant occurrence of Crohn disease and CGD, both characterized by granulomatous inflammation, is noteworthy.

The bacteria is known as a cause of severe lung infections in cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. The authors observed a nosocomial outbreak of B. cepacia, the strains were isolated from five patients. In one case occurred colonization of the decubitus and in the other four severe pneumonia or sepsis. Four patients developed respiratory failure and septic shock and were admitted to intensive care unit. The infections led to death of two patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility that the hospital environment or cross-infection were the source of pathogen. The authors discussed the influence of previously used antibiotics on B. cepacia selection and drug susceptibility data as well, as the influence of obtained microbiological data on therapeutic decision making process. We were not able to confirm origin of B. cepacia strains, but in our opinion the hospital environment was the most probable source of pathogen. Increasing multidrug resistance were observed during the time of outbreak. In a case of the last patient we observed only weak susceptibility to imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: B. cepacia may be an etiologic agent of severe hospital acquired pneumonia and sepsis among immunocompromised patients. Clinically infection develops picture of superinfection and usually is life-threatening condition."

In the present study, we have compared the susceptibility patterns to 13 antimicrobials of 94 Bcc isolates obtained from 15 Portuguese CF patients in the course of chronic infection during a five-year survey. These isolates were previously genotyped and represent 11 different strains of the species B. cenocepacia (subgroups A and B), B. cepacia, B. multivorans, and B. stabilis. The results are consistent with the notion that CF Bcc isolates are resistant to the most clinically relevant antimicrobials and suggest an uneven distribution of resistance rates among the different species, with B. cenocepacia subgroup A isolates being the most resistant. Phenotypic variants exhibiting differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were obtained from the sputum samples of clinically deteriorated CF patients during chronic lung infection. The isolation of resistant variants coincided with periods of pulmonary exacerbation and antibiotics therapy."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:19674113TITLE:Cystic fibrosis infections: treatment strategies and prospects.ABSTRACT:Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia are the two major Gram-negative rods that colonize/infect the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). These organisms may cause progressive respiratory failure, although occasionally more rapid infections result in the 'Cepacia' syndrome. Many antibiotics have been used against Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, but once chronic colonization has been established, eradication of these organisms is rare. Drug therapy for CF patients is compromised by a number of bacterial factors that render the infectious agents resistant to antibiotics, including efflux pumps that remove antibiotics, lack of penetration of antibiotics into bacterial biofilms, and changes in the cell envelope that reduce the permeability of antibiotics. Any combination of these mechanisms increases the likelihood of bacterial survival. Therefore, combinations of antibiotics or of antibiotic and nonantibiotic compounds are currently being tested against Pseudomonas and Burkholderia. However, progress has been slow, with only occasional combinations showing promise for the eradication of persistent Gram-negative rods in the airways of CF patients. This review will summarize the current knowledge of CF infections and speculate on potential future pathways to treat these chronic infections."

We hypothesised that sputum microbiology may have changed as a result of this. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of sputum microbiology from adult CF patients (1985 to 2005) using the Royal Brompton Hospital CF database. RESULTS: Colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus between 1985 and 2005 remained stable (77 to 82%, p=0.159; 54 to 47%, p=0.108; respectively). Haemophilus influenzae (48 to 6%; p&lt;0.001), Aspergillus species (18 to 9%; p=0.002) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (9 to 4%; p=0.041) prevalence decreased. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and MRSA increased (1 to 4%, p=0.02; 1 to 6%, p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa colonisation has remained stable; there has been a decline in B. cepacia complex, H. influenzae and Aspergillus sp., and only a small increase in S. maltophilia and MRSA. Intensive antibiotic strategies have been employed, which, so far, have not resulted in clinically significant emergence of new pathogens."

METHOD: A retrospective hospital infection study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from January 2005 to December 2008. RESULT: Six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as HAP. The incidence of HAP was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset HAP and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset HAP. The HAP patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). The proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. Main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. There was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in ICU, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. Two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. One hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. There were 30 (13.0%) Gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%) fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. The predominant bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations cephalosporins. The main pathogens of early-onset HAP were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset HAP were ESBLs-positive Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: HAP in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. The main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. RSV was an important pathogen of HAP. The pathogens of early-onset HAP are different from those of late-onset HAP. These results may be of some help in prevention and control of HAP in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice."

In recent years however there has been an increasing number of reports on potentially emerging and challenging pathogens like Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria, highly prevalent P. aeruginosa clones, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. Also, a role for viral infections in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease has increasingly been recognised.

We describe here a case of CGD that presented with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a 2-month-old girl. We confirmed pulmonary aspergillosis noninvasively through a positive result from the culture of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid, positive serological test for Aspergillus antigen and radiology results. She was successfully treated with Amphotericin B and recombinant IFN-gamma initially. Six weeks later after discharge, she was readmitted for pneumonia. Since there were infiltrates on the right lower lung, which were considered as residual lesions, voriconazole therapy was initiated.

Cases were defined as the microbiological detection of B. cepacia complex (BCC) in any clinical specimen sent to the laboratory during 30 June to 21 October 2008. Species identification of BCC was performed by recA gene sequencing, followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE; SpeI digest) for clonal identity. In total, 61 BCC-positive cases were diagnosed at the two campuses. At least nine patients contracted a ventilator-associated pneumonia with BCC. One patient suffered an infection of a pacing wire insertion site and four patients had septicaemia. Sixteen patients died in hospital, none thought to be due to the outbreak strain. BCC was eventually found in packages of moist prefabricated washcloths used for intensive care patients. German healthcare authorities were informed and a Europe-wide alarm (RAPEX) was initiated through the systems to prevent infections in other hospitals. PFGE proved clonal identity between isolates from clinical specimens and washcloths of both campuses. After elimination of the contaminated washcloths no further cases occurred. This example of a relatively newly introduced product raises the question of whether current regulations are adequate to protect consumers. For critically ill patients, care products should be carefully evaluated. In case of infections due to contaminated products, immediate communication to healthcare authorities is required, including RAPEX warning if products are sold across Europe."

Currently, the morbidity and mortality associated with CF are fundamentally related with the lung affectation that is a consequence of this defect. With the progression of the disease, there is an increase in the isolation of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli colonizing these patients. The genus Pandoraea arises from a reclassification of species included within the ""Burkholderia cepacia complex"". It is made up of 9 species susceptible only to tetracycline, imipenem and cotrimoxazole. We report the first clinical case in Spain of colonization by Pandoraea sputorum in a patient diagnosed with CF at the age of eleven. After several previous colonizations by different Pseudomonas species in September 2005, a gram-negative bacillus was isolated in sputum, which was identified by sequencing and mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) as P. sputorum, only sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam, cotrimoxazole and imipenem. From 2005 to 2008, chronic colonization by this microorganism was associated with deterioration in lung function that was recuperated after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. In 2010, this microorganism was once again isolated and treated with imipenem, to which the patient responded favorably. Currently, it is not known whether this microorganism is a chronic colonizer, whether it produces a transitory infection or whether it constitutes an important problem in CF patients, but given its special characteristics of sensitivity to anti-microbial drugs, the correct identification of this genus is essential. Mass spectrometry seems to be a valid technique that is faster than sequencing methods for identifying these species."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised patients hospitalized at the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc who developed pneumonia. From those patients, secretion samples were collected for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: A total of 77 secretion samples from 51 patients were analyzed. Of 90 isolates, 71 were classified as etiologic agents, with the most frequently isolated strains being those of Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 %), Burkholderia cepacia complex (10 %) and Escherichia coli (8 %). The highest proportions of multiresistant strains were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (56 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (52 %), Escherichia coli (25 %) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (100 %). Pairs of identical strains were detected in five cases (3x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2x Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In Burkholderia cepacia complex, the same strain was identified in four out of five cases. Eighteen patients died during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Most isolates were single strains and hospital-acquired pneumonia may be characterized as endogenous. Four identical cultures of Burkholderia cepacia complex were classified as Burkholderia multivorans by the MALDI-TOF system and clonal spread of this strain may be assumed."

METHODS: Patients with microbiological detection of Bcc were evaluated. Products used for mouth hygiene were microbiologically tested. The clonal identity of Bcc was proven by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: On 3 ICUs 12 cases were identified whereby the first detection of Bcc was in respiratory specimens of 11 patients and 1 in a wound swab from the oral cavity. Of these patients six developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Investigations revealed that five different batches of an alcohol-free mouthwash containing hexetidine were highly contaminated. Isolates of Bcc from patients and mouthwashes were genetically indistinguishable. A recall of the product was initiated. After elimination of the product from the ICUs no more cases were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The source of the outbreak was an intrinsically contaminated alcohol-free mouthwash. Detection of Bcc in specimens from ICU patients should lead to further investigations. Antiseptic oral care products are recommended for reducing the risk of VAP but they may be microbiologically contaminated and, in consequence, increase the risk.

METHODS: Included were patients hospitalized in the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc in 2009 who developed HAP. Bacterial pathogens and their resistance to antibiotics were identified using standard microbiological methods. The patient's mortality with respect to their initial antibiotic therapy was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The group comprised 51 patients with HAP. Early-onset HAP was identified in 7 (14%) patients and late-onset HAP in 44 (86%) patients. The most frequent bacterial pathogens were strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Escherichia coli, together accounting for 72%. Eighteen patients died directly due to HAP, an overall mortality rate of 35%. If initial therapy effective against the bacterial pathogen was selected, 21 patients survived and 9 died. If the bacterial pathogens were resistant to the selected initial antibiotic therapy, 9 patients died and 12 survived. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rates were 30% and 43% for adequate and inadequate antibiotic therapy, respectively. Given the small group of patients, the difference has low statistical significance. However, it does document the clinical impact of bacterial resistance on the survival or death of patients with HAP."

Bcc bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment and are recognized as serious opportunistic pathogens that are virtually impossible to eradicate from the CF lung, posing a serious clinical threat. The epidemiological survey of Bcc bacteria involved in respiratory infections at the major Portuguese CF Treatment Center at Santa Maria Hospital, in Lisbon, has been carried out by our research group for the past 16 years, covering over 500 clinical isolates where B. cepacia and B. cenocepacia are the predominant species, with B. stabilis, B. contaminans, B. dolosa, and B. multivorans also represented. The systematic and longitudinal study of this CF population during such an extended period of time represents a unique case-study, comprehending 41 Bcc-infected patients (29 pediatric and 12 adult) of whom around 70% have been persistently colonized between 7 months and 9 years. During chronic infection, the CF airways represent an evolving ecosystem, with multiple phenotypic variants emerging from the clonal population and becoming established in the patients' airways as the result of genetic adaptation. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms involved is crucial for an improved therapeutic outcome of chronic infections in CF. This review focuses on our contribution to the understanding of these adaptive mechanisms based on extensive phenotypic, genotypic, and genome-wide expression approaches of selected Bcc clonal variants obtained during long-term colonization of the CF airways."

Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 17 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia, and are greatly feared by patients. Burkholderia cepacia bacteria are innately resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Since strict patient segregation was introduced to cystic fibrosis medical care, the incidence of the more virulent epidemic strains has fallen, and new infections are more likely to be with environmentally-acquired strains which seem to exhibit less virulence. Nonetheless, exacerbations of respiratory symptoms require effective therapy directed against the dominant bacterial species. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common chronic infection in cystic fibrosis, these cannot be directly extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. The aim of this review is to assess the available trial evidence for choice and application of treatments for Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation, who are chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of latest search: 29 November 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials were identified. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for cystic fibrosis clinicians and patients alike. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages and the problem of how to manage and treat these infections becomes more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each patient individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. There is a clear need for multi-centre randomised clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in cystic fibrosis patients infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex."

The viruses in severe pneumonia remain poorly defined. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban City, Philippines from May 2008 to May 2009. Patients aged 8 days to 13 years old who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics with severe pneumonia were enrolled for the study. Upon admission, polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs and blood cultures to detect respiratory viruses and bacteria, respectively. RESULT: Among the 819 patients enrolled, at least one virus was detected in 501 cases (61.2%). In addition, 423 cases were positive for a single virus while bacteria were detected in the blood culture sample of 31 cases. The most commonly detected viruses were human rhinoviruses (n = 189), including types A (n = 103), B (n = 17), and C (n = 69), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 165). Novel viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus NL63, human bocavirus, and human polyomaviruses WU and KI were also detected. There were 70 deaths, and one or more viruses were detected in 35 (50%) of these cases. Positivity only for influenza A virus (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.3-14.6) was significantly associated with fatal outcome. From the blood culture, Burkholderia cepacia group (n = 9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 1), and Salmonella C1 (n = 1) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: Viruses were commonly detected in children with severe pneumonia in the Philippines.

X-linked variant CGD can be missed during routine evaluation or present later in life due to hypomorphic mutations and a residual superoxide production. The case of a 10-month-old boy who died of pneumonia is reported. The isolation of Burkholderia cepacia from his lung, together with a marginally low nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay (NBT), made us suspect and pursue the molecular diagnosis of CGD. A postmortem genetic analysis finally demonstrated CGD caused by a hypomorphic missense mutation with normal gp91 (phox) expression. In a patient being investigated for unusually severe or recurrent infection, a high index of suspicion of immunodeficiency must be maintained. "

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:25449242TITLE:Healthcare-associated respiratory tract infection and colonization in an intensive care unit caused by Burkholderia cepacia isolated in mouthwash.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: Burkholderia cepacia has been linked to healthcare-associated infections and colonization caused by contamination of alcohol-free mouthwash used in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The purpose of our study was to establish the source of a clustering of healthcare-associated B. cepacia isolates in patients on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: During April 2012 the Infection Control Committee became concerned when B. cepacia was isolated from tracheal aspirate cultures of three ICU patients. The medical records for the years 2011 and 2012 were reviewed to identify further cases. Cultures of potential reservoirs were done. Isolates from patients and an alcohol-free mouthwash were submitted to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis and antimicrobial resistance testing. RESULTS: Four patients with positive cultures for B. cepacia were identified before the review of the medical records for the years 2011 and 2012. Nine further cases were identified in the review, defined as a patient with pneumonia who had a culture of respiratory secretions that was positive for B. cepacia. Three were cases of infection and 10 were colonizations. All of the isolates from patients (J, K, L, and M) and mouthwash samples (B19, B20, and B21) were genetically identical by MLST analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest that alcohol-free mouthwash solution intrinsically contaminated with B. cepacia was the source of these colonizations and infections involving adults in the ICU."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:25791927TITLE:Epidemiology of infection and current guidelines for infection prevention in cystic fibrosis patients.ABSTRACT:The spectrum of bacterial pathogens encountered in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease has expanded over the last decade. In addition to established pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Staphylococcus aureus, novel Gram-negative non-fermenter bacteria and non-tuberculous mycobacteria have gained in clinical significance. Air sampling performed in inpatient and outpatient clinics, and analysis of cough aerosols expelled by CF patients provides evidence for potential airborne transmission of CF pathogens. Two outbreaks of 'Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense' have been reported among CF patients, raising the question of airborne transmission of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. In response to newer epidemiological evidence, international infection control guidance documents have changed. Guideline documents agree on the importance of specifications for ventilation when planning new CF inpatient facilities. New CF units should consider providing negative-pressure inpatient and outpatient rooms to diminish the risk of airborne contamination of ward corridors and communal areas. Air exchange rates of inpatient rooms and pulmonary function testing rooms need to be considered and optimized whenever possible. International guidelines disagree as to whether patients should be requested to wear masks in the hospital environment. "

The potential for this pathogen to infect non-cystic fibrosis patients is limited and its epidemiology is poorly understood. Previously reported cases of severe Burkholderia cepacia complex lung infection in immunocompetent hosts include pneumonia, bronchiectasis, pyopneumothorax, and cavitary lesions. We present a case of a 64-year-old man with Streptococcus pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia whose hospital course was complicated by developing cavitary lung lesions, bacteremia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Repeated tracheal aspirate and blood cultures grew Burkholderia cepacia. Our case appears to be the first report of Cepacia syndrome in a patient without cystic fibrosis. This report raises concern regarding the potential severity of pulmonary Burkholderia cepacia complex infection and the need to broaden clinicians' suspicion for Cepacia syndrome. A framework to help diagnose and treat infected non-cystic fibrosis individuals may be useful. "

Data about such cases are rare in Turkey. We present the first 2 living-donor liver transplants performed in Turkey in patients with viral hepatitis/human immunodeficiency virus coinfection. CASE 1: A 47-year-old man infected with human immunodeficiency virus with chronic hepatitis B and D and hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria had been taking antiretroviral medication before his liver transplant. An unrelated right lobe liver transplant was performed uneventfully in this patient, who was human immunodeficiency virus RNA-negative and had a CD4 T-cell count of 500/muL. Antiretroviral treatment continued in the early postoperative period, and a triple immunosuppressive regimen consisting of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids was initiated. Burkholderia cepacia pneumonia developed postoperatively, and was treated successfully. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 18, and is still alive 58 months after the operation. CASE 2: A 62-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus and chronic hepatitis C virus infection was taking antiretroviral treatment before the liver transplant. The patient was hepatitis C virus RNA-positive, human immunodeficiency virus RNA-negative, and had a CD4 T-cell count of 620/muL. His son was the donor, and a right lobe liver transplant was performed uneventfully in antiretroviral treatment continued in the early postoperative period and a triple immunosuppressive regimen consisting tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids was initiated. Broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Escherichia coli bacteremia and hospital-acquired pneumonia developed postoperatively and were treated successfully. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 19, and remains alive 13 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Living-donor liver transplant is a promising treatment choice for end-stage liver disease in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:26789750TITLE:Antibiotic treatment for Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary infection is a hallmark of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 18 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia. Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria are resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Following patient segregation in cystic fibrosis medical care, the more virulent epidemic strains are not as frequent, and new infections are more likely to be with less virulent environmentally-acquired strains. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for treating respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these cannot be extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. This review, which is an update of a previous review, aims to assess the available trial evidence for the choice and application of treatments for these infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation and chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of latest search: 28 August 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials were identified. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for people with cystic fibrosis and their clinicians. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages; and managing and treating these infections will become more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each person individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. Multicentre randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex."

In Central Europe, there is a dearth of information on the prevalence and treatment of HAP. This project was aimed at collecting multicenter epidemiological data on patients with HAP in the Czech Republic and comparing them with supraregional data. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational study processed data from a database supported by a Czech Ministry of Health grant project. Included were all consecutive patients aged 18 and over who were admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) between 1 May 2013 and 31 December 2014 and met the inclusion criterion of having HAP. The primary endpoint was to analyze the relationships between 30-day mortality (during the stay in or after discharge from ICUs) and the microbiological etiological agent and adequacy of initial empirical antibiotic therapy in HAP patients. RESULTS: The group dataset contained data on 330 enrolled patients. The final validated dataset involved 214 patients, 168 males (78.5%) and 46 females (21.5%), from whom 278 valid lower airway samples were obtained. The mean patient age was 59.9 years. The mean APACHE II score at admission was 21. Community-acquired pneumonia was identified in 13 patients and HAP in 201 patients, of whom 26 (12.1%) had early-onset and 175 (81.8%) had late-onset HAP. Twenty-two bacterial species were identified as etiologic agents but only six of them exceeded a frequency of detection of 5% (Klebsiella pneumoniae 20.4%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, Escherichia coli 10.8%, Enterobacter spp. 8.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 6.2% and Burkholderia cepacia complex 5.8%). Patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus had significantly higher rates of early-onset HAP than those with other etiologic agents. The overall 30-day mortality rate for HAP was 29.9%, with 19.2% mortality for early-onset HAP and 31.4% mortality for late-onset HAP. Patients with late-onset HAP receiving adequate initial empirical antibiotic therapy had statistically significantly lower 30-day mortality than those receiving inadequate initial antibiotic therapy (23.8% vs 42.9%). Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) had significantly higher mortality than those who developed HAP with no association with mechanical ventilation (34.6% vs 12.7%). Patients having VAP treated with adequate initial antibiotic therapy had lower 30-day mortality than those receiving inadequate therapy (27.2% vs 44.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study was the first to collect multicenter data on the epidemiology of HAP in the Central European Region, with respect to the incidence of etiologic agents causing HAP. It was concerned with relationships between 30-day patient mortality and the type of HAP, etiologic agent and adequacy of initial empirical antibiotic therapy."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:27103163TITLE:The first reported case of Burkholderia contaminans in patients with cystic fibrosis in Ireland: from the Sargasso Sea to Irish Children.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Burkholderia contaminans is an emerging pathogen in the cystic fibrosis (CF) setting. Included in the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), B. contaminans is a Gram negative, motile, obligate aerobe previously classified as a pseudomonad. Previous reports have described B. contaminans isolation from patients in Portugal, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina and the USA. This, however, is the first report relating to B. contaminans affecting Irish patients with CF, initially detected in a paediatric setting. CASE PRESENTATION: Burkholderia contaminans was identified in the routine analysis of sputum from a fourteen year old boy, at his annual review and subsequently from the sputum from his 19 year old brother. RecA gene sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were unable to distinguish between the isolates, which demonstrated with susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, meropenem, pipercillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Both isolates were resistant to aztreonam, with reduced susceptibility to tobramycin. Following treatment with intravenous meropenem and ceftazidime, oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised tobramycin for 6 weeks, sputum specimens from both patients were negative for B. contaminans. No other member of the local CF cohort proved positive. CONCLUSIONS: Bcc bacteria are associated with poor prognosis in CF and decreased life expectancy, specifically leading to a more rapid decline in lung function and, in some cases, to a fatal necrotizing pneumonia known as the ""cepacia syndrome"". Some species exhibit innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents and their transmission rate can be high in susceptible patients. In that context, we describe the first incidence of CF-related B. contaminans in Ireland and its successful eradication from two patients, one paediatric, using an aggressive antimicrobial regimen."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:27476589TITLE:[Antibiotic therapy of hospital-acquired pneumonia and its pharmacoeconomics].ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Important hospital-acquired infections include pneumonia, mainly because of the increasing resistance of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobials and the associated potential failure of antibiotic therapy. The present study aimed at determining the most frequent etiological agents of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and assessing the relationship between 30-day mortality and adequacy of antibiotic therapy. Based on the obtained information, optimal patterns of antibiotic therapy were to be defined, including a pharmacoeconomic perspective. METHODS: In patients with clinically confirmed HAP, bacterial etiological agents were identified, their susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined and statistical methods were used to assess the relationship between adequacy of antibiotic therapy and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: The study comprised 68 patients with clinically confirmed HAP. The most common etiological agents were strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.8 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.1 %) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (15.4 %). Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 86.5 % of all bacterial pathogens. The overall mortality reached 42.5 %. In the subgroup of patients with inadequate antibiotic therapy, 30-day mortality was significantly higher (83.3 %) than in the subgroup with adequate therapy (30.0 %; p = 0.002). The risk for 30-day mortality was 2.78 times higher in case of inadequate antibiotic therapy (95%CI: 1.52-5.07). The proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with inadequate antibiotic therapy than in those with adequate therapy (67 % vs. 27 %; p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggest a significant relationship between mortality of patients with HAP and ineffective antibiotic therapy due to resistance of the bacterial pathogen. Thus, it is clear that initial antibiotic therapy must be based on qualified assumption of sufficient activity against the most common bacterial pathogens and results of surveillance of bacterial resistance in the relevant epidemiological unit. At the same time, however, it must be stressed that it is impossible to cover all potential variants of the etiological agents and their resistance phenotypes."

Three cases of cerebral infarctions that were not found during life but were newly recognized on PMI and were associated with severe systemic infections are presented. CASE PRESENTATIONS: An 81-year-old woman with a pacemaker and slightly impaired liver function presented with fever. Imaging suggested interstitial pneumonia and an iliopsoas abscess, and blood tests showed liver dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite three-agent combined therapy for tuberculosis, she died 32 days after hospitalization. PMI showed multiple fresh cerebral and cerebellar infarctions and diffuse ground-glass shadows in bilateral lungs. On autopsy, the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis was made, and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis that involved the aortic valve may have caused the cerebral infarctions. A 74-year-old man on steroid therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus presented with severe anemia, melena with no obvious source, and DIC. Imaging suggested intestinal perforation. The patient was treated with antibiotics and drainage of ascites. However, he developed adult respiratory distress syndrome, worsening DIC, and renal dysfunction and died 2 months after admission. PMI showed infiltrative lung shadow, ascites, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a wide infarction in the right parietal lobe, and multiple new cerebral infarctions. Autopsy examination showed purulent ascites, diffuse peritonitis, invasive bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis that likely caused the cerebral infarctions. A 65-year-old man with an old pontine infarction presented with a fever and neutropenia. Despite appropriate treatment, his fever persisted. CT showed bilateral upper lobe pneumonia, pain appeared in both femoral regions, and intramuscular abscesses of both shoulders developed. His pneumonia worsened, his level of consciousness decreased, right hemiplegia developed, and he died. PMI showed a newly diagnosed cerebral infarction in the left parietal lobe. The autopsy revealed bilateral bronchopneumonia, right-sided pleuritis with effusion, an intramuscular abscess in the right thigh, and fresh multiple organ infarctions. Systemic fibrin thrombosis and DIC were also found. Postmortem cultures showed E. coli and Burkholderia cepacia. CONCLUSION: Cerebral infarction that is newly recognized on PMI might suggest the presence of severe systemic infection."

METHODS: Review of the health care-associated infection data regarding B cepacia via the surveillance system, hospital information system, electronic medical records, and laboratory information system together with the outbreak investigation was managed by the health care-associated infection control team. RESULTS: During June 1-14, 2015, 4 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were identified; B cepacia was isolated from endotracheal aspirate samples. On June 16, 120 environmental samples were collected and analyzed for microbiologic differentiation. Thirteen strains of B cepacia were prominently found in the expiratory blocks of ventilators, revealing the biocontamination source. After chemical disinfection without damaging ventilator components, repeat microbiologic testing of random ventilator samples yielded negative results until July 30, 2015. Retrospective data showed that isolation rates of B cepacia strains had increased since 2014. Although the resistance phenotype of these strains varied slightly, they exhibited similar patterns of antibiotic susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Routine cleaning and disinfection of ventilators, in addition to an intervention bundle, should form part of an integrated VAP prevention and management approach."

METHODS: A prospective, structured clinicomicrobiological surveillance was carried out for 3 common DA-HAIs: ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) present in the patients of an intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nepal. DA-HAIs were identified using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions, and their rates were expressed as number of DA-HAIs per 1,000 device-days. RESULTS: Overall incidence rate of DA-HAIs was 27.3 per 1,000 patient-days occurring in 37.1% of patients. The device utilization ratio for mechanical ventilation, central line catheter, and urinary catheter was 0.83, 0.63, and 0.78, respectively. The rates of VAP, CLABSI, and CAUTI were 21.40, 8.64, and 5.11 per 1,000 device-days, respectively. Acinetobacter spp (32.7%), Klebsiella spp (23.6%), Burkholderia cepacia complex (12.7%), and Escherichia coli (10.9%) were the common bacterial pathogens. Most of the bacterial isolates associated with DA-HAIs were found to be multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of DA-HAIs in the study intensive care unit was high compared with that of developed countries. Formulation and implementation of standard infection control protocols, active surveillance of DA-HAIs, and antimicrobial stewardship are urgently needed in our country."

They are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, excess hospitalization and financial costs. The present study is an attempt to investigate the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates involved in healthcare associated infections (HCAI) in the patients of a critical care unit at a tertiary care university hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. METHODS: A laboratory based study was conducted over the period of 15 months (January 2014 to March 2015) among the patients of intensive care unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Clinical specimens from patients with suspected healthcare-associated infection were processed and bacterial isolates were identified with standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolated strains were determined according to the CLSI guidelines and beta-lactamases (ESBL, AmpC, MBL and KPC) were detected by various phenotypic tests. RESULTS: One hundred and forty nine clinical specimens received from 135 patients suspected of HCAI (out of 491 patients) were found with significant bacterial growth. Specimens were from patients suspected of hospital-acquired pneumonia (16%, 79/491), bloodstream infections (5.7%, 28/491), surgical site infections (4.7%, 23/491), and urinary tract infections (3.9%, 19/491). Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli and Burkholderia cepacia were the leading bacterial pathogens. Extremely high level of drug resistance (95.8%) along with the production of beta-lactamases (ESBL; 43.7%, AmpC; 27.5%), MBL; 50.2% and KPC; 4.2%) was observed among Gram negative bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Healthcare associated infections are very common in our ICU. Gram negative bacterial pathogens are major culprits associated with these infections and there is alarming state of drug resistance among these isolates. Continuous surveillance and establishment of preventive and control measures of healthcare associated infections are urgently needed in our setting."

BCC isolates were identified to the species level by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system and by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Sequencing of the recA gene in the 54 blood isolates revealed 37 (68.5%) isolates of B. cenocepacia, 9 (16.7%) of B. cepacia, 4 (7.4%) of B. multivorans and one isolate each of B. arboris, B. pseudomultivorans, B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis. The overall performance of the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system for correctly identifying the 54 BCC isolates to the species level was 79.6%, which was better than that (16.7%) by 16S RNA sequencing analysis. Bacteraemic pneumonia (n = 23, 42.6%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (n = 21, 38.9%) were the most common types of infection. Higher rates of ceftazidime and meropenem resistance were found in B. cepacia isolates (33.3% and 22.2%, respectively) than in isolates of B. cenocepacia (21.6% and 10.8%, respectively) and other species (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively).

We investigated Bcc bloodstream infections (BSIs) in a cohort of non-CF patients from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods: Using VHA databases, we identified patients with Bcc BSI at facilities nationwide from 1999 through 2015. We ascertained clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes and identified factors associated with 30-day mortality in logistic regression analysis. Results: We identified 248 patients with Bcc BSI, who were of advanced age (mean, 68 years), chronically ill, and had severe disease. The most common sources were central venous catheters (41%) and pneumonia (20%). Most cases were hospital-acquired (155 [62%]) or healthcare-associated (70 [28%]). Mortality at 14, 30, and 90 days was 16%, 25%, and 36%, respectively. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and fluoroquinolones were active against 94% and 88% of isolates, respectively. Susceptibility to ceftazidime and meropenem occurred in approximately 70% of the isolates. The most prescribed antibiotics were fluoroquinolones (35%), followed by carbapenems (20%), TMP-SMX (18.5%), and ceftazidime (11%). In regression analysis, age (OR, 1.06 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.02-1.10], per added year) and the Pitt bacteremia score (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.44-1.94], per unit increase) were associated with higher 30-day mortality. Conclusions: In this large cohort of BSIs caused by Bcc, cases were mostly hospital-acquired and we observed high mortality, significant resistance to ceftazidime, and limited use of TMP-SMX. These observations add to our understanding of Bcc infection in non-CF patients and highlight the need for interventions to improve their outcome."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 16 children with Burkholderia cepacia infection who were hospitalized between June 2012 and September 2017. RESULTS: All 16 children with Burkholderia cepacia infection were sporadic cases. A total of 16 strains of Burkholderia cepacia were isolated, among which 8 were detected by sputum culture, 5 were detected by blood culture, 2 were detected by tracheal intubation tip culture, and 1 was detected by lung biopsy culture. Of the 16 children, there were 11 boys and 5 girls, with an age of 5 days to 6 years, and the children aged &lt;1 year accounted for 69%. As for department distribution, 10 children were in the PICU/NICU and 6 were in the general wards. As for clinical manifestations, one child had disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the other 15 children had pulmonary infection, among who 11 had severe pneumonia (8 of them underwent mechanical ventilation during treatment). As for underlying diseases, 2 had severe congenital heart disease, 4 had primary immunodeficiency, 3 were highly suspected of immunodeficiency or inherited metabolic diseases, 1 had tracheal stenosis, 1 had Kawasaki disease, 1 was a preterm infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 1 had severe cleft lip and palate, and 3 had no definite underlying diseases. Of all the children, 7 also had infections with adenovirus and Mycoplasma. The average length of hospital stay was 20.3 days for all children, and 12 were improved and 4 died after treatment. All 16 strains of Burkholderia cepacia had a drug resistance rate of 100% to amikacin and gentamicin and &gt;=80% to ampicillin/sulbactam and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, as well as the lowest drug resistance rate to levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia cepacia is an opportunistic pathogen often found in immunocompromised children and can produce drug resistance. The presence or absence of underlying diseases should be considered during anti-infective therapy. The children with Burkholderia cepacia infection often have a poor prognosis, and an understanding of the disease spectrum of Burkholderia cepacia infection helps with clinical diagnosis and treatment."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:30345929TITLE:Burkholderia cepacia Complex Causing Pneumonia in an Immunocompetent Non-Cystic Fibrosis Patient: Case Report and Review of Literature.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Burkholderia cepacia complex is widespread in the environment and has been recognized as a cause of opportunistic pulmonary infections, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The natural ecology of the bacteria as part of plant growth-promoting rhizosphere provides stark contrast to its infectious potential. Its preponderance as a nosocomial pathogen may be due to its ability to survive in antiseptic solutions, contaminate equipments, and intrinsic antimicrobial resistance. CASE REPORT: An elderly, diabetic male was evaluated for hemoptysis, fever and cough. Chest computed tomography showed thick walled cavity in left lung and hilar lymphadenopathy. Sputum examination showed Gram negative bacilli and no acid fast bacilli. Sputum culture yielded growth of non-fermentative Gram negative bacilli on two occasions, but blood culture was sterile. The isolate was identified as B. cepacia by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The patient's general condition remained poor and in spite of initiation of antibiotics, the patient expired after an episode of massive hemoptysis. CONCLUSION: This report raises concerns regarding the spread and severity of B. cepacia infection in non-compromised patients in the community and the need to suspect and identify it. Since the organism is inherently resistant to antipseudomonal penicillins, aminoglycosides and polymyxin B, differentiation from Pseudomonas spp. and determining antimicrobial susceptibility is paramount for treatment ."

He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with T-tube placement a few weeks prior to admission. On workup, abdominal CT scan was unremarkable, but blood cultures on the third hospital day grew Burkholderia cepacia Antibiotic regimen was shifted to ceftazidime and levofloxacin. The bacteraemia and febrile episodes persisted despite removal of the central line and T tube. White blood cell scan and chest CT scan showed left-sided consolidation pneumonia. Blood cultures continued to grow B. cepacia despite shifting to meropenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Meropenem nebulisation at 250 mg every 12 hours was added to the regimen on the third week then oral minocycline was added on the fourth week due to persistence of bacteraemia. He subsequently developed a small vegetation on the aortic valve, so amikacin was added.

The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia cepaciaID:32239690TITLE:Antibiotic treatment for Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary infection is a hallmark of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 18 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia. Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria are resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Following patient segregation in cystic fibrosis medical care, the more virulent epidemic strains are not as frequent, and new infections are more likely to be with less virulent environmentally-acquired strains. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for treating respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these cannot be extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. This review, which is an update of a previous review, aims to assess the available trial evidence for the choice and application of treatments for these infections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation and chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 29 May 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials were identified. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for people with cystic fibrosis and their clinicians. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages; and managing and treating these infections will become more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each person individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. Multicentre randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex."

METHODS: Over a 72-day period, a multidisciplinary ICU team detected two distinct periods of high and unusual incidence of Bcc isolates that were recovered from cultures of endotracheal aspirate. Cultures of tap water, ultrasound gel and mouthwash (opened and unopened bottles) were performed. Bcc was identified with the BD-Phoenix  and MALDI-TOF MS systems, with molecular typing using the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) technique. RESULTS: In both outbreak 1 (6 patients) and outbreak 2 (5 patients), the point sources of Bcc were chlorhexidine mouthwashes of two different brands, both of them intrinsically contaminated. All patients had a clinical diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and 6 died. MALDI-TOF MS identified 2 species of Bcc (B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia). ERIC-PCR typing confirmed 100% genetic similarity between patient and mouthwash isolates from each period. The first outbreak was controlled in 20 days and the second in 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance program for multidrug-resistant organisms, especially in high-risk patients, with the active participation of a multidisciplinary team, was crucial for success in controlling these outbreaks."

Western Rajasthan has cases of Cystic fibrosis due to migrant population. The dry and dusty environment has led to prevalence of silicosis and COPD. As per IDSA (2018) guidelines, patients attending Out-Patient Department do not need microbiological investigations for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) except for influenza and tuberculosis. Aims: This study was conducted to identify the bacterial aetiology of LRTI among patients who attended AIIMS, Jodhpur, and to ascertain the current scenario of bacterial susceptibility in respiratory tract infections in order to optimize empiric therapy in Hospitals ad community. Methods and Material: In total, 1,775 lower respiratory tract samples were received in Bacteriology Section of Microbiology Department (January 2017 to December 2018). Bartlett's criteria were stringently used to assess quality of specimen. Semiquantitative cultures were done for tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Following culture, the isolated organisms were identified and antimicrobial sensitivity was performed according to CLSI. Results: Total 769 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 1,775 samples collected from cases of VAP, HAP, CAP, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas species was the commonest isolate (31%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (21.3%), Acinetobacter species (17.5%), Escherichia coli (15.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5%). Others include Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Nocardia.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the changing epidemiology and clinical outcomes associated with Burkholderia species infections in persons with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: A cohort study of children and adults with CF was conducted from 1997 - 2018 in Toronto, Canada. Patients were characterised as having no history of Burkholderia species infection and those who were culture-positive for Burkholderia spp. for the first time in this time frame, categorized by species (B. gladioli, B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans or other) and strain (B. cenocepacia ET-12). Cox models were used to estimate risk of death or transplantation. Mixed effects models were used to assess impact of Burkholderia species on odds of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and effect on lung function (FEV1% predicted). RESULTS: A total of 1196 patients were followed over 20 years; 88 patients (7.4%) had >= 1 culture positive for Burkholderia species. Patients with ET-12 infection had a median time to death of 1.95 years compared to 5.30-6.72 years for those with other Burkholderia infections. ET-12 infection was associated with a greater risk of death or transplantation compared to patients with no history of Burkholderia infection in a univariate model (HR 3.92, 95% CI 2.25 - 6.81) but was no longer significant after adjusting for confounders. PEx were more common in those with Burkholderia infections and remained significant in the ET-12 group after adjusting for confounders (OR 2.96 (1.17 - 7.53)). No differences were noted in baseline FEV1% or the rate of FEV1% decline between the groups with and without Burkholderia species infection. CONCLUSION: With the exception of ET-12, acquisition of Burkholderia species infection did not appear to worsen clinical outcomes compared to those with no history of infection. Given this, prognosis, management and clinical trial inclusion protocols may need to be re-evaluated for persons with Burkholderia infection."

Regardless of appropriate antibiotics and an initial negative blood culture, he developed severe hypoglycemia, circulatory collapse with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and expired.

Subsequent postmortem autopsy showed multifocal bilateral pneumonia with necrotizing granulomatous and suppurative portions of lung tissue. Additionally, there was a prominent cavitary lesion 2.5 cm in the right lower lobe with branching and septate fungal hyphae. Stellate microabscesses with granulomas were present in the liver and spleen. These findings plus B. cepacia bacteremia are highly suggestive of an immunocompromised status. Review of the literature shows that its presence has been associated with chronic granulomatous disease.

The presentation of Bcc can vary from a virtually asymptomatic chronic infection, to an acute, life-threatening necrotizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and bacteremia (cepacia syndrome) associated with a mortality rate up to 75%. We present the successful treatment of a 17-year-old male with chronic granulomatous disorder who presented with cepacia syndrome and confirmed Bcc pneumonia using a novel antimicrobial approach. Despite initial IV antimicrobial therapy, our patient continued to decline, developing hypotension requiring pressor support and eventually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. An aggressive, multimechanistic approach including the combination of nebulized tobramycin, IV sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ceftazidime, enteral minocycline, and corticosteroids was implemented. This multimechanistic antimicrobial approach in combination with systemic corticosteroids led to the successful treatment of cepacia syndrome in the setting of necrotizing pneumonia due to B cepacia with full respiratory recovery. We suggest that in patients with cepacia syndrome who continue to decline despite IV antimicrobial therapy, using multiple antimicrobial mechanisms of action may improve clinical outcomes."

Earlier reports from North American centers suggested that patients with cystic fibrosis were at greater risk for heart-lung or isolated lung transplantation than other patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. During a 3 1/2 year period, 44 patients with end-stage lung disease resulting from cystic fibrosis underwent double lung transplantation at this institution. During the same interval, 18 patients with cystic fibrosis died while waiting for lung transplantation. The ages of the recipients ranged from 8 to 45 years, and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 21% predicted. Seven patients had Pseudomonas cepacia bacteria before transplantation. Bilateral sequential implantation with omentopexy was used in all patients. There were no operative deaths, although two patients required urgent retransplantation because of graft failure. Cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary in six procedures in five patients and was associated with an increased blood transfusion requirement, longer postoperative ventilation, and longer hospital stay. Actuarial survival was 85% at 1 year and 67% at 2 years. Infection was the most common cause of death within 6 months of transplantation (Pseudomonas cepacia pneumonia was the cause of death in two patients), and bronchiolitis obliterans was the most common cause of death after 6 months. Actuarial freedom from development of clinically significant bronchiolitis obliterans was 59% at 2 years. Results of pulmonary function tests improved substantially in survivors, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second averaging 78% predicted 2 years after transplantation.

Prior to LTX, all patients were colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ten patients were also colonized with Pseudomonas cepacia. Both organisms were specifically sought before LTX. All patients who grew P cepacia before LTX did so after LTX. Five additional patients only grew this bacterium after LTX. There was no difference between those who grew P cepacia and those who did not in terms of data before LTX for age, weight, pulmonary function, and 6-min walk. After LTX, 7 of the 15 patients who had ever grown P cepacia died. No patient who grew only P aeruginosa died. The median survival in the subgroup with P cepacia was 28 days. Five of the seven died as a direct result of P cepacia pneumonia and sepsis. One died of cyclosporin A (cyclosporine) neurotoxicity with concurrent P cepacia pneumonia, and one died at the time of a retransplant for graft failure (associated with three bouts of P cepacia pneumonia and cytomegalovirus). Four of seven had not grown this bacterium before LTX. There were no perioperative factors, including antibiotic choices, that distinguished survivors and nonsurvivors. Overall 1-year survival is about 70 percent (15/22). Fourteen bouts of P cepacia pneumonia occurred in 12 patients. Four empyemas, one lung abscess, one suppurative pericarditis, and five cases of sinusitis were also due to this bacterium. In conclusion, P cepacia is responsible for excess morbidity and mortality after LTX. This organism is particularly lethal if isolated for the first time after LTX. Factors predicting its acquisition in this setting are unknown. While it is possible that the facial sinuses may act as an unrecognized reservoir or that patients or equipment provide a source, further study into the epidemiology of this organism is necessary to improve the survival of colonized patients undergoing LTX."

Extensive surveillance cultures of the environmental surfaces and respiratory equipment of the hospital revealed that all nebulizing devices were contaminated with P cepacia. To characterize this outbreak, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 37 patients colonized with this organism. All had used nebulizers to deliver aerosols containing polymyxin B and amphotericin B as prophylaxis against infection. Sixteen of these 37 patients developed pneumonia, which was caused in 14 by P cepacia. The majority of the 14 patients showed lobular infiltrates on chest x-ray films. Cavity formation and pleural effusion were observed in 4 of the 14 (29 percent). All strains of P cepacia were resistant to piperacillin, cefotiam, sulbactam/cefoperazone, moxalactam (latamoxef), cefuzonam, amikacin, tobramycin, ofloxacin, imipenem, and carumonam. Ceftazidime was effective against 84.7 percent of the strains, while minocycline was effective against 63.5 percent of the strains.

Of the three SLTs, BOOP was diagnosed by open lung biopsy (OLB) in two and one was found at autopsy. Of the 14 DLTs, BOOP was diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy (TBB) specimens (9), OLB specimens (2), autopsy (1), TBB and OLB specimens (1), and OLB specimens and autopsy (1). BOOP was found between 1 and 43 months posttransplantation; time of survival from diagnosis was between 2 and 36 months with 9 patients presently alive. Concurrent pathologic diagnosis at the time of BOOP findings were as follows: acute rejection (7) (grade 1 [4] and grade 2 [3]), BO and grade 1 rejection (2), BO and grade 2 rejection (2), BO and Aspergillus infection (1), acute alveolar injury (1), acute alveolar injury and pulmonary embolus (1), acute rejection (grade 1) and Burkholderia cepacia pneumonia (1). No other pathologic diagnosis was found in 1 patient. In total, 11 of 17 patients (65%) had associated acute rejection. Of the 17 patients, 7 subsequently developed BO and 3 had BO before the finding of BOOP. Death occurred in 8 patients (5 DLT and the 3 SLT) between 2 and 6 months after the diagnosis. We conclude that BOOP is an important complication after lung transplantation; it was present in 13% of DLTs and 5% of SLTs. BOOP was most often associated with acute rejection."

Best known previously as a phytopathogen and the cause of soft rot of onions, B. cepacia presents three major problems for the CF community: innate multiresistance to antimicrobial agents; person-to-person transmission of epidemic strains through nosocomial or social contacts; and 'cepacia syndrome', a fulminating fatal pneumonia, sometimes associated with septicaemia, that occurs in approximately 20% of colonised patients, including those with previously mild disease. Accumulated evidence to dispel earlier suggestions that the organism is avirulent and merely a marker of existing lung disease includes: case-controlled studies in CF patients; reports of serious infections in non-CF patients; in-vitro and in-vivo evidence that B. cepacia induces production of pro-inflammatory markers, including the major cytokine TNFalpha; and histopathological evidence that exposure of transgenic CF mice to B. cepacia results in pneumonia. By the early 1990s, the use of selective culture media and DNA-based bacterial fingerprinting confirmed suspicions of epidemic person-to-person spread of B. cepacia. This evidence provided scientific justification for draconian and controversial measures for infection control, in particular, segregation of B. cepacia-colonised patients during treatment at CF centres and their exclusion from social gatherings and national conferences. Recently, molecular analyses of type strains and clinical isolates have revealed that isolates identified previously as B. cepacia belong to at least three distinct species and have increased concern regarding the reliability of current laboratory detection and identification systems. Clarification of the taxonomy of B. cepacia-like organisms and the pathogenic potential of environmental isolates remains a high priority, particularly when the organism's antifungal and degradative properties have created interest in its potential use as a biological control agent to improve crop yields and its use for the bioremediation of contaminated soils."

In both patients disease manifested late. Life expectancy of CF-patients has markedly increased over the last decades. In the adult distinct complications appear more often such as exacerbation of bronchitis due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, colonisation of air ways by Burkholderia cepacia or by atypical mycobacteria, development of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, bronchiectases and spontaneous pneumothorax. Today, even in adults with chronic bronchitis of unknown origin the possibility of CF has to be considered. Optimized treatment under clinical conditions, in combination with a physical training program and a diet rich in calories will ameliorate subjective physical performance as well as objective pulmonary function and work capacity. Regular rehabilitation programs contribute to better compliance. In patients with CF direct transition from pediatric to pneumologic/internistic treatment for adults is mandatory in order to optimize expectancy and quality of life."

Cases were defined as the microbiological detection of B. cepacia complex (BCC) in any clinical specimen sent to the laboratory during 30 June to 21 October 2008. Species identification of BCC was performed by recA gene sequencing, followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE; SpeI digest) for clonal identity. In total, 61 BCC-positive cases were diagnosed at the two campuses. At least nine patients contracted a ventilator-associated pneumonia with BCC. One patient suffered an infection of a pacing wire insertion site and four patients had septicaemia. Sixteen patients died in hospital, none thought to be due to the outbreak strain. BCC was eventually found in packages of moist prefabricated washcloths used for intensive care patients. German healthcare authorities were informed and a Europe-wide alarm (RAPEX) was initiated through the systems to prevent infections in other hospitals. PFGE proved clonal identity between isolates from clinical specimens and washcloths of both campuses. After elimination of the contaminated washcloths no further cases occurred. This example of a relatively newly introduced product raises the question of whether current regulations are adequate to protect consumers. For critically ill patients, care products should be carefully evaluated. In case of infections due to contaminated products, immediate communication to healthcare authorities is required, including RAPEX warning if products are sold across Europe."

These bacteria are important opportunistic pathogens, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and are associated with a worse prognosis and decreased life expectancy. The taxonomic position of 20 Bcc isolates retrieved from CF patients receiving care at Hospital Santa Maria (HSM), in Lisbon, from 1995 to 2006, was re-examined in the present work. These isolates, formerly classified as Burkholderia cepacia (taxon K), are here reclassified as Burkholderia contaminans, including the former B. cepacia IST408, which was the focus of previous studies regarding the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide 'cepacian'. The CF population examined has been previously described as having an exceptionally high representation of B. cepacia, presumably due to a contamination arising from saline solutions for nasal application. Twenty-one additional isolates, obtained from a chronically infected patient, from 2006 to 2010, were also identified as B. contaminans. This study also provides insight into the potential clinical impact of B. contaminans, a species that is rarely associated with CF infections. Isolates belonging to this species were shown to be involved in chronic and transient respiratory infections, and were associated with severe lung function deterioration and with a case of death with cepacia syndrome. However, since the patients were co-infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia and other non-Burkholderia bacteria, the role played by B. contaminans is unclear. Nevertheless, B. contaminans isolates were found to prevail over B. cenocepacia isolates during co-infection of at least one chronically infected patient. "

Included in the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), B. contaminans is a Gram negative, motile, obligate aerobe previously classified as a pseudomonad. Previous reports have described B. contaminans isolation from patients in Portugal, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina and the USA. This, however, is the first report relating to B. contaminans affecting Irish patients with CF, initially detected in a paediatric setting. CASE PRESENTATION: Burkholderia contaminans was identified in the routine analysis of sputum from a fourteen year old boy, at his annual review and subsequently from the sputum from his 19 year old brother. RecA gene sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were unable to distinguish between the isolates, which demonstrated with susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, meropenem, pipercillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Both isolates were resistant to aztreonam, with reduced susceptibility to tobramycin. Following treatment with intravenous meropenem and ceftazidime, oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised tobramycin for 6 weeks, sputum specimens from both patients were negative for B. contaminans. No other member of the local CF cohort proved positive. CONCLUSIONS: Bcc bacteria are associated with poor prognosis in CF and decreased life expectancy, specifically leading to a more rapid decline in lung function and, in some cases, to a fatal necrotizing pneumonia known as the ""cepacia syndrome"". Some species exhibit innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents and their transmission rate can be high in susceptible patients. In that context, we describe the first incidence of CF-related B. contaminans in Ireland and its successful eradication from two patients, one paediatric, using an aggressive antimicrobial regimen."

Unexpectedly, C. pelliculosa was cultured from two bottles, but not the B. contaminans bottle or respiratory secretions. Methods:B. cepacia, later identified as B. contaminans, was cultured from a bottle of liquid docusate (Colace) dispensed to a non-cystic fibrosis patient. His respiratory secretions were colonized with B. contaminans. Results: Eradication of B. contaminans colonization in the patient's respiratory secretions was attempted. With levofloxacin, B. contaminans developed multidrug resistance (MDR). Subsequent TMP-SMX therapy did not result in further MDR. Nine other ICU patients were given docusate from the same lot, but there were no other B. contaminans isolates. Conclusion:B. contaminans colonization of respiratory secretion may be difficult to eliminate. The significance of C. pelliculosa cultured from liquid docusate (Colace) remains to be elucidated. In this case, it appeared that B. contaminans may have inhibited the growth of C. pelliculosa in the same bottle.

Some species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients and are responsible for nosocomial outbreaks. The B. cepacia complex is a recognized respiratory pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis. Burkholderia cenocepacia and Burkholderia multivorans (B. multivorans) are the most prevalent species in the world, according to the literature. However, research groups in Argentina have described a particular local epidemiology, with prevalence of Burkholderia contaminans (B. contaminans). METHODS: A total of 68 isolates of B. cepacia complex recovered of 46 cystic fibrosis patients attended at 14 hospitals distributed in 9 provinces of the country were studied. Identification was carried out by conventional phenotypic methods and was confirmed by recA gene sequencing. Sequences were analysed using the BLASTN program and comparing with B. cepacia complex type strains sequences deposited in GenBank. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on isolates of the most prevalent species according to CLSI M45 guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalent specie was B. contaminans (49%, n = 33) followed by B. cenocepacia (25%; n = 17). The remaining species were Burkholderia seminalis (B. seminalis) (7%, n = 5), B. cepacia (7%, n = 5), B. multivorans (6%, n = 4), Burkholderia vietnamensis (5%, n=3) and Burkholderia pyrrocinia (1%; n = 1). The 46% of B. contaminans isolates were resistant to SXT and 76% sensitive to MIN, MEM and CAZ. The isolates of B. cenocepacia were 100% resistant to SXT and MIN and 47% to CAZ and MEM. B. seminalis showed high levels of resistance to TMS (80%), CAZ (60%) and MIN (60%), and 60% of the isolates showed intermediate sensitivity to MEM. CONCLUSION: Previous reports have described the prevalence of B. contaminans isolation from cystic fibrosis patients in Argentina, Spain and Portugal, and a case of two patients with cystic fibrosis in Ireland has recently been reported. Due to the high frequency with which B. contaminans is isolated in our country, it is necessary to promote the investigation of possible sources of infection and to understand the factors and mechanisms involved in the apparent greater transmissibility of this species. Different antimicrobial resistance profiles were detected between the species."

This species is an emerging pathogen and it has been widely isolated from CF patients in Argentina, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Canada, USA with a low prevalence in Ireland, France, Russia, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Italy. This is the first report of B. contaminans affecting two Italian CF patients attending the same CF Centre. We correlate B. contaminans colonisation with lung function decline and co-infection with other clinically relevant CF pathogens. CASE PRESENTATION: B. contaminans was identified by Multi Locus Sequence Typing in routine sputum analysis of two Caucasian CF women homozygous for Phe508del CFTR mutation. Sequence Type 102 was detected in both strains. It is known that B. contaminans ST102 was isolated both from CF and non-CF patients, with an intercontinental spread across the world. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis revealed the genetic relatedness between the two strains. We examined their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, comparing the latter with that recorded for other B. contaminans isolated from different countries. We also described key virulence factors possibly linked with a clinical outcome. Specifically, we attempted to correlate colonization with the incidence of acute exacerbation of symptoms and lung function decline. CONCLUSIONS: This case presentation suggests that acquisition of B. contaminans ST102 is not directly associated with a lung function decline. We retain that the presence of other CF pathogens (i.e. MRSA and Trichosporon) along with B. contaminans ST102 might have contributed to the worsening of clinical conditions in our CF patients. The circumstances leading to the establishment of B. contaminans ST102 infections are still unknown. We highlight the importance to proper detect and typing bacteria implicated in CF infection by using molecular techniques."

Clinical implications of the recently characterized genomovar VI, B. dolosa, are unknown. OBJECTIVES: Characterization of impact of B. dolosa on pulmonary function and mortality in cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We compared patients chronically infected with B. dolosa (n = 31) with unmatched patients with B. multivorans (n = 24) and with age- and sex-matched control subjects without Burkholderia species (n = 58). We analyzed rates of pulmonary function decline (% predicted FEV(1)) using a random effects model assuming segmented linear trends. All available FEV(1) measurements from 5 yr (median, 4.8) before until 2.5 yr (median, 1.5) after the first positive culture for Burkholderia (reference date) were analyzed. Survival was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazards model. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline FEV(1) and rate of decline were similar in the cohorts. Decline in FEV(1) after the reference date accelerated in patients with B. dolosa (-2.3 percentage points/yr pre vs. -7.1 post, p = 0.002), but was unchanged in the B. multivorans and control patients (-2.3 vs. -0.8 post, p = 0.38, and -2.1 pre vs. -0.5 post, p = 0.20, respectively). The probability of dying within 18 mo of the reference date was 13, 7, and 3% for B. dolosa, B. multivorans, and control patients, respectively (B. dolosa vs. control hazard ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-92.8; p = 0.03).

RESULTS: Twenty two of 27 patients with B. dolosa were eligible and twelve elected to participate. Eradication of B. dolosa was not noted in any study subject. While patients tolerated treatment with no adverse effects, there was also no apparent impact on other secondary outcome measures.

During 18 years of epidemiological surveillance in the major Portuguese CF centre in Lisbon, only one patient was infected with B. dolosa. Pulmonary deterioration, associated with the evolution of forced expiratory volume in 1 s, occurred during 5.5 years of colonization with this B. dolosa clone (with the new sequence type ST-668). Transient co-colonization with Burkholderia cenocepacia and other bacterial and fungal pathogens occurred, but B. dolosa prevailed until the patient's death. The systematic assessment of relevant phenotypes for the sequential clonal isolates examined in this retrospective study (14 of B. dolosa and four of B. cenocepacia) showed that they were variants, although in general no isolation time-dependent pattern of alteration was identified. However, the first B. dolosa isolate retrieved was more susceptible to gentamicin, imipenem and tobramycin, and exhibited a higher swarming motility compared with most of the isolates obtained during the later stages of disease progression and antimicrobial therapy."

Colonization with various organisms in CF patients may impact post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is made up of distinct genomovars with significant morbidity and mortality associated with B. cenocepacia (genomovar III) following lung transplant. The outcomes of patients infected with genomovar B. dolosa (genomovar VI) have yet to be described in the literature. We performed a retrospective chart review of all cystic fibrosis patients colonized with B. dolosa from our center who underwent lung transplantation (n = 11) at various medical centers across the US between 2000 and 2014. Survival rates were 73%, 53%, and 30% for 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Median survival was 44 months (95% CI = 11.1-76.8). CF patients with B. dolosa that have undergone lung transplantation have decreased one-year survival when compared to all patients transplanted with cystic fibrosis. Conditional 5-year survival for B. dolosa-infected patients was 43% in patients that survived the first year post-transplant, suggesting that this first year is crucial in managing the infection. Importantly, the survival of the B. dolosa patients was higher than compared to previously reported survival rates of B. cenocepacia patients post-transplant."

Infection with Burkholderia species is typically considered a contraindication to transplantation in CF. However, the risks posed by different Burkholderia species on transplantation outcomes are poorly defined. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the risks of infection with Burkholderia species on survival before and after lung transplantation in patients with CF. METHODS: Multivariate Cox survival models assessed hazard ratios of infection with Burkholderia species in 1,026 lung transplant candidates and 528 lung transplant recipients. Lung allocation scores, incorporating Burkholderia infection status, were calculated for transplant candidates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Transplant candidates infected with different Burkholderia species did not have statistically different mortality rates. Among transplant recipients infected with B. cenocepacia, only those infected with nonepidemic strains had significantly greater post-transplant mortality compared with uninfected patients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-6.12; P = 0.04). Hazards were similar between uninfected transplant recipients and those infected with B. multivorans (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.27-1.56; P = 0.34). Transplant recipients infected with B. gladioli had significantly greater post-transplant mortality than uninfected patients (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.05-4.74; P = 0.04). Once hazards for species/strain were included, lung allocation scores of B. multivorans-infected transplant candidates were comparable to uninfected candidate scores, whereas those of candidates infected with nonepidemic B. cenocepacia or B. gladioli were lower.

Little is known about B. gladioli infection in newborns. The aim of this study was to present the features of B. gladioli infection in newborns. Clinicopathological characteristics, patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, predisposing factors, and outcomes of B. gladioli bloodstream infection were retrospectively analyzed in newborns treated between 2008 and 2011. During the 3-year study period, B. gladioli was isolated from the blood cultures of 14 patients (3.7 per 1,000 admissions). In all, 5 (35.7 %) of the 14 cases had a positive blood culture at the time of initial admission. Primary diagnoses in the neonates were severe major congenital anomalies, congenital leukemia, prematurity with respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and parapneumonic pleural effusion. In total, 10 (71.4 %) of the patients underwent &gt;=2 invasive procedures. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.4 %, whereas the mortality rate due to B. gladioli infection was 7 %.

METHODS: A cohort study of children and adults with CF was conducted from 1997 - 2018 in Toronto, Canada. Patients were characterised as having no history of Burkholderia species infection and those who were culture-positive for Burkholderia spp. for the first time in this time frame, categorized by species (B. gladioli, B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans or other) and strain (B. cenocepacia ET-12). Cox models were used to estimate risk of death or transplantation. Mixed effects models were used to assess impact of Burkholderia species on odds of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and effect on lung function (FEV1% predicted). RESULTS: A total of 1196 patients were followed over 20 years; 88 patients (7.4%) had >= 1 culture positive for Burkholderia species. Patients with ET-12 infection had a median time to death of 1.95 years compared to 5.30-6.72 years for those with other Burkholderia infections. ET-12 infection was associated with a greater risk of death or transplantation compared to patients with no history of Burkholderia infection in a univariate model (HR 3.92, 95% CI 2.25 - 6.81) but was no longer significant after adjusting for confounders. PEx were more common in those with Burkholderia infections and remained significant in the ET-12 group after adjusting for confounders (OR 2.96 (1.17 - 7.53)). No differences were noted in baseline FEV1% or the rate of FEV1% decline between the groups with and without Burkholderia species infection. CONCLUSION: With the exception of ET-12, acquisition of Burkholderia species infection did not appear to worsen clinical outcomes compared to those with no history of infection.

Natural infection is most commonly reported in northeast Thailand and northern Australia but also occurs in other parts of Asia, South America, and the Caribbean. Melioidosis develops after bacterial inoculation or inhalation, often in relation to occupational exposure in areas where the disease is endemic. Clinical infection has a peak incidence between the fourth and fifth decades; with diabetes mellitus, excess alcohol consumption, chronic renal failure, and chronic lung disease acting as independent risk factors. Most affected adults ( approximately 80%) in northeast Thailand, northern Australia, and Malaysia have &gt;/=1 underlying diseases. Symptoms of melioidosis may be exhibited many years after exposure, commonly in association with an alteration in immune status. Manifestations of disease are extremely broad ranging and form a spectrum from rapidly life-threatening sepsis to chronic low-grade infection. A common clinical picture is that of sepsis associated with bacterial dissemination to distant sites, frequently causing concomitant pneumonia and liver and splenic abscesses. Infection may also occur in bone, joints, skin, soft tissue, or the prostate. The clinical symptoms of melioidosis mimic those of many other diseases; thus, differentiating between melioidosis and other acute and chronic bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, is often impossible. Confirmation of the diagnosis relies on good practices for specimen collection, laboratory culture, and isolation of B. pseudomallei. The overall mortality rate of infected persons is 50% in northeast Thailand (35% in children) and 19% in Australia."

It is frequently found as a saprophyte in soil, water and other damp environments and is an opportunistic pathogen in patients with underlying medical disorders or with indwelling catheters. It has been reported as an uncommon cause of bacteremia, sepsis, septic arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, and peritonitis. Thus, early and accurate identification of this rare species is important for the treatment and also to provide information about the epidemiology of P.luteola infections. This report was aimed to draw attention to the accurate identification of P.luteola in clinical samples, upon the isolation and identification in two cases in the medical microbiology laboratory of a university hospital. In February 2011, a 66-year-old man, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia, was admitted to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea. A chest tube was inserted on the 20th day of admission by the reason of recurrent pleural effusion. Staphylococcus aureus and a non-fermentative gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) with wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies were isolated from the pleural fluid sample obtained on the 9th day following the insertion of the chest tube. In February 2012, a 7-year-old male cystic fibrosis patient who had no signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary exacerbation was admitted to the hospital for a routine control. This patient had chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.aureus and his sputum sample obtained at this visit revealed isolation of P.aeruginosa, S.aureus, Aspergillus fumigatus and a wrinkled, sticky yellow NFGNB. Both of these NFGNB were identified as P.luteola by the Phoenix automated microbial identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA). To evaluate the microbiological characteristics of these two isolates, the strains were further analysed by VITEK MS (bioMerieux, France) and Microflex LT mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Both of the MALDI-TOF-MS systems identified the isolates as P.luteola and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (ABI PRISM 3100, Applied Biosystems, USA) also confirmed the identification. The strains had wrinkled, sticky yellow colonies which were oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and non-fermentative. The Gram stained smears of the colonies revealed clusters of gram-negative bacilli probably embedded into a biofilm matrix. Since there are no accepted standards for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of P.luteola strains, the standards determined by CLSI for ""other non-Enterobacteriaceae"" (non-fermentative bacteria excluding P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Burkholderia cepacia, B.mallei, B.pseudomallei and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were used for the susceptibility testing. Gradient MIC method (E-Test, bioMerieux, France) revealed that the isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, colistin and levofloxacin. Accurate and prompt identification of P.luteola which is identified as a rare pathogen in serious cases is of critical importance since it has been suggested that this organism is likely to become more frequent as a nosocomial pathogen since the interventional processes increase in current medical practice. This report supported that Phoenix automated phenotypic identification system (BD Diagnostics, USA) and the two MALDI-TOF-MS based systems (VITEK MS and Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer) were successfull in the accurate identification of P.luteola."

These infections are difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the bacteria to antibiotics. Bacteria can spread between CF patients through social contact and sometimes cause cepacia syndrome, a fatal pneumonia accompanied by septicemia. Burkholderia cenocepacia has been the focus of attention because initially it was the most common Bcc species isolated from patients with CF in North America and Europe. Today, B. cenocepacia, along with Burkholderia multivorans, is the most prevalent Bcc species in patients with CF. Given the progress that has been made in our understanding of B. cenocepacia over the past decade, we thought that it was an appropriate time to review our knowledge of the pathogenesis of B. cenocepacia, paying particular attention to the characterization of virulence determinants and the new tools that have been developed to study them. A common theme emerging from these studies is that B. cenocepacia establishes chronic infections in immunocompromised patients, which depend more on determinants mediating host niche adaptation than those involved directly in host cells and tissue damage."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised patients hospitalized at the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc who developed pneumonia. From those patients, secretion samples were collected for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: A total of 77 secretion samples from 51 patients were analyzed. Of 90 isolates, 71 were classified as etiologic agents, with the most frequently isolated strains being those of Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 %), Burkholderia cepacia complex (10 %) and Escherichia coli (8 %). The highest proportions of multiresistant strains were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (56 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (52 %), Escherichia coli (25 %) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (100 %). Pairs of identical strains were detected in five cases (3x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2x Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In Burkholderia cepacia complex, the same strain was identified in four out of five cases. Eighteen patients died during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Most isolates were single strains and hospital-acquired pneumonia may be characterized as endogenous. Four identical cultures of Burkholderia cepacia complex were classified as Burkholderia multivorans by the MALDI-TOF system and clonal spread of this strain may be assumed."

The multidrug-resistant nature of Bcc and differing infective Bcc species make the design of appropriate treatment regimens challenging. Previous synergy studies have failed to take account of the species of Bcc isolates. Etest methodology was used to facilitate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antimicrobial combination testing on 258 isolates of Bcc, identified to species level by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). The most active antimicrobials were trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, doxycycline and minocycline (52.5%, 46.4% and 45.9% of isolates susceptible, respectively). Synergy was observed in 9.2% of the 1799 combinations tested; the most common synergistic combinations were tobramycin + ceftazidime, meropenem + tobramycin and levofloxacin + piperacillin/tazobactam (35.4%, 32.3% and 22.2% synergy, respectively). Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis revealed differences between Burkholderia cenocepacia and Burkholderia multivorans. Disparity in clinical outcome during infection with these two micro-organisms necessitates further investigation into the clinical outcomes of treatment regimens in light of species identification and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility studies."

METHODOLOGY: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used to identify isolates to genus level, followed by recA/gyrB sequence clustering or species-specific PCR. In all, 1047 Burkholderia isolates were submitted for identification from 361 CF patients and 112 non-CF patients, 25 from the hospital environment and three from a commercial company. Potential cross-infection was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi- locus-sequence typing (MLST). MICs were determined for 161 Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) isolates. CF Trust registry data were sought to examine clinical parameters relating to Bcc infection. RESULTS: Burkholderia multivorans was the most prevalent species among CF patients affecting 56 % (192) patients, followed by Burkholderia cenocepacia IIIA (15 %; 52 patients). Five novel recA clusters were found. Among non-CF patients, Burkholderia cepacia was the most prevalent species (37/112; 34 %), with 18 of 40 isolates part of a UK-wide B. cepacia 'cluster'. This and three other clusters were investigated by PFGE and MLST. Cable-pili positive isolates included two novel sequence types and representatives of ET12. Antibiotic susceptibility varied between and within species and CF/non- CF isolates. CF Trust registry data suggested no significant difference in lung function between patients harbouring B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans and other Bcc species (P=0.81). CONCLUSION: The dominance of B. multivorans in CF, the presence of a B. cepacia cluster among non-CF patients and the existence of putative novel species all highlighted the continuing role of Burkholderia species as opportunistic pathogens."

The microorganisms were identified by biochemical tests, the Vitek2 Compact test, recA-PCR and recA-nested-PCR with species-specific primers and DNA sequencing. The patients were evaluated by the Shwachman-Kulczycki score (SKCS), Bhalla score (BS), spirometry and body mass index (BMI). The BCC prevalence was 22.5%. The most common species were Burkholderia multivorans (30%), Burkholderia cepacia (24%), Burkholderia cenocepacia IIIA (10%), B. cenocepacia IIIB (2%) and Burkholderia vietnamiensis (2%). There was difference between the groups in nutritional status (p = 0.02) and general activity (p = 0.026). There was difference in total BS points (p = 0.04) and the following parameters: bronchiectasis severity (p = 0.007), peribronchial thickening (p = 0.013), bronchiectasis extent (p = 0.01) and general aspects of the affected bronchial zone (p = 0.02). The respiratory disorder classifications were as follows: obstructive-4.8% (Group-A) and 23.8% (Group-B); restrictive-9.5% (Group-A and Group-B); obstructive + restrictive-19% (Group-A) and 1.6% (Group-B); and obstructive + restrictive with a decreased forced expiratory flow-47.6% (Group-A) and 30.2% (Group-B) (p = 0.02). Nutritional status was a minor contributing factor to weight, height and BMI in the Group-A (p = 0.02). The BCC prevalence, particularly the prevalence of B. multivorans, was higher in this study. The SKCS, BS, spirometry and nutritional status results showed that BCC has a negative impact on clinical status. Phenotypic methods are useful for the identification of presumptive BCC. The Vitek2 Compact test showed accuracy in BCC identification. PCR, nested-PCR, and recA sequencing showed specificity in BCC species identification."

Some species have emerged as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients and are responsible for nosocomial outbreaks. The B. cepacia complex is a recognized respiratory pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis. Burkholderia cenocepacia and Burkholderia multivorans (B. multivorans) are the most prevalent species in the world, according to the literature. However, research groups in Argentina have described a particular local epidemiology, with prevalence of Burkholderia contaminans (B. contaminans). METHODS: A total of 68 isolates of B. cepacia complex recovered of 46 cystic fibrosis patients attended at 14 hospitals distributed in 9 provinces of the country were studied. Identification was carried out by conventional phenotypic methods and was confirmed by recA gene sequencing. Sequences were analysed using the BLASTN program and comparing with B. cepacia complex type strains sequences deposited in GenBank. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on isolates of the most prevalent species according to CLSI M45 guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalent specie was B. contaminans (49%, n = 33) followed by B. cenocepacia (25%; n = 17). The remaining species were Burkholderia seminalis (B. seminalis) (7%, n = 5), B. cepacia (7%, n = 5), B. multivorans (6%, n = 4), Burkholderia vietnamensis (5%, n=3) and Burkholderia pyrrocinia (1%; n = 1). The 46% of B. contaminans isolates were resistant to SXT and 76% sensitive to MIN, MEM and CAZ. The isolates of B. cenocepacia were 100% resistant to SXT and MIN and 47% to CAZ and MEM. B. seminalis showed high levels of resistance to TMS (80%), CAZ (60%) and MIN (60%), and 60% of the isolates showed intermediate sensitivity to MEM. CONCLUSION: Previous reports have described the prevalence of B. contaminans isolation from cystic fibrosis patients in Argentina, Spain and Portugal, and a case of two patients with cystic fibrosis in Ireland has recently been reported. Due to the high frequency with which B. contaminans is isolated in our country, it is necessary to promote the investigation of possible sources of infection and to understand the factors and mechanisms involved in the apparent greater transmissibility of this species. Different antimicrobial resistance profiles were detected between the species."

Much effort has been made to find an easy and valid approach to be used in clinical practice. METHODS: The primary endpoint of this prospective, observational study was to determine the predictive value of oropharyngeal swab (OS) and gastric aspiration (GA) as simple and non-invasive methods for diagnosing HAP. Their efficacy was compared to endotracheal aspiration (ETA) and protected specimen brushing (PSB), the standard methods approved for HAP diagnosis. RESULTS: Initially, 56 patients were enrolled. Significant amounts of bacterial pathogens were detected in 48 patients (79 isolates) in Round A and in 39 patients (45 isolates) in Round B (after 72 hours). The sensitivity rates were: ETA 98%, PSB 31%, OS 64% and GA 67% in Round A and ETA 87%, PSB 32%, OS 74% and GA 42% in Round B. Strains of 12 bacterial species were identified in the samples. The three most common etiological agents (both rounds together) were Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.7%), Burkholderia multivorans (21.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Blind ETA is an optimum method for obtaining biological samples for identification of etiological agents causing HAP in intubated patients. Microbial etiological agents were more frequently detected in ETA samples than in those collected by PSB. If ETA/PSB results are negative, samples may be collected by OS and/or GA as these techniques followed ETA in terms of the frequency of pathogen detection."

Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei first described by Whitmore in 1912 in Burma. B. pseudomallei is a Gram negative rod belonging to the Pseudomonadaceae family. Soil and water are the natural reservoirs for the germ which is a specific pathogen for several mammal species. Long endemic in Southeast Asia and several tropical zones, B. pseudomallei has recently been found in temperate zones, including France. Human contamination occurs via the transcutaneous route and often leads to dormant inapparent infection. Many conditions, such as diabetes, renal lithiasis, various circumstances of immunodepression or stress, facilitate clinical manifestations which vary greatly. Pulmonary manifestations may be acute and extensive, producing a torpid pseudo-tuberculous condition or a variety of clinical and radiological features mimicking other diseases. Bacteriological and serological tests may be negative. Exposure in an endemic zone, the notion of a favorable context, weight loss, cavitary images on successive chest x-rays and the presence of extra-pulmonary localizations may be suggestive. Ceftazidime or the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination are indicated, but mortality in acute forms still reaches 40%. Relapse can be expected if the treatment duration is too short."

Its highest prevalence in Thailand is in the north-eastern part. Most infected patients had worked paddy fields or had underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Melioidosis can manifest clinically, with either disseminated or localized features. In the disseminated form patients developed an acute and progressive course with septicaemia. In contrast, patients with the localized form usually presented with prolonged fever, and symptoms of one or more organ involvement, in particular the lung and the liver. Definite diagnosis of melioidosis is made by an isolation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from a variety of clinical specimens. Treatment of choice for the septicaemic patients is an initial combination of ceftrazidime and trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole, followed by trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole for up to 6-12 months depending on the result of clinical specimen culture. Treatment for the localized form requires simultaneous antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. However, optimum duration of antibiotic therapy remains unknown so further research is required. Melioidosis is an important disease in terms of mortality rate and it requires rapid diagnosis and treatment.

Younger patients were more likely to be infected with M. pneumoniae, while the mean age of those with other types of infections was 50. Healthy adults were infected with M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae; specific pathogens attacked patients with certain co-morbidity : i) diabetes mellitus and ageing, ii) diabetes mellitus and renal disease, iii) cardiovascular diseases, and iv) connective tissue diseases and steroid-use; these patients were vulnerable to i) K. pneumoniae, ii) B. pseudomallei, iii) H. influenzae, and iv) S. aureus respectively. White blood cell counts were normal in M. pneumoniae infection. Gram-stained sputum had some limitations, especially when determining Gram-negative infections; chest x-rays could not differentiate pathogens. Bactermia was found in one half of patients infected with B. pseudomallei and S. aureus. Antibiotic-resistant organisms were not common in our study. Because morbidity and mortality were high among patients infected with S. aureus and B. pseudomallei, empirical antibiotic treatment should be considered in suspected cases, especially when patients present with acute severe community-acquired pneumonia."

Infection usually follows percutaneous inoculation or inhalation of the causative bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is present in soil and surface water in the endemic region. While 20-36% of melioidosis cases have no evident predisposing risk factor, the vast majority of fatal cases have an identified risk factor, the most important of which are diabetes, alcoholism and chronic renal disease. Half of all cases present with pneumonia, but there is great clinical diversity, from localised skin ulcers or abscesses without systemic illness to fulminant septic shock with multiple abscesses in the lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. At least 10% of cases present with a chronic respiratory illness (sick &gt; 2 months) mimicking tuberculosis and often with upper lobe infiltrates and/or cavities on chest radiography. As with tuberculosis, latency with reactivation decades after infection can also occur, although this is rare. Confirmation of diagnosis is by culture of B. pseudomallei from blood, sputum, throat swab or other samples. Microbiology laboratories need to be informed of the possibility of melioidosis, as those not familiar with it can misidentify the organism. Antibiotic therapy is initial intensive therapy with i.v. ceftazidime or meropenem or imipenem +/- cotrimoxazole for &gt; or = 10 days, followed by eradication therapy with cotrimoxazole +/- doxycycline +/- chloramphenicol (first 4 weeks only) for &gt; or = 3 months. Melioidosis has been increasingly recognised in returning travellers in Europe and recently melioidosis and colonisation with B. pseudomallei have been documented in cystic fibrosis patients visiting or resident in endemic areas."

Median rainfall in the 14 days before admission was highest (211 mm) for those dying with melioidosis, in comparison to 110 mm for those surviving (p=0.0002). Median 14-day rainfall was also significantly higher for those with pneumonia. On univariate analysis, a prior 14-day rainfall of 125 mm was significantly correlated with pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.70 [confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 2.65]), bacteremia (OR 1.93 [CI 1.24 to 3.02]), septic shock (OR 1.94 [CI 1.14 to 3.29]), and death (OR 2.50 [CI 1.36 to 4.57]).

We describe some clinical and radiological features of bacteraemic pneumonia due to Burkholderia pseudomallei as well as a comparison with bacteraemic patients without pneumonia. METHODS: Patients with positive blood cultures for B. pseudomallei from October 1997 to November 2001 were included. Patients were grouped as 'Pneumonia' and 'Non-pneumonia' according to clinical and radiological features. RESULTS: Eighteen (60%) out of total 30 patients were in the pneumonia group. There was no significant difference in age, WBC count, platelet counts and bilirubin levels between the groups. However the 'Pneumonia' group had higher incidences of hyponatraemia, acidosis, diabetes with poor control, renal impairment and shorter length of stay. Twelve (66%) of 18 patients in the pneumonia group required ICU admission compared to none in the non-pneumonia group; all required mechanical ventilation. Only 13/30 (43%) patients had initial empiric antibiotic therapy that is appropriate for melioidosis. The pneumonia group also had significantly higher mortality (13/18, 72%) rate than the non-pneumonia group (3/12, 25%, P=0.03). Chest radiographs were non-specific. 7/18 (38%) had unilobar involvement of the lung, mostly left sided; the rest had multilobar or bilateral involvement. Six (33%) had pleural effusion. No patient had cavitary lung disease. Visceral abscesses (spleen, liver and prostate) were also common in ultrasound and CT scans in both groups. CONCLUSION: (1) Bacteraemic melioidosis with pneumonia carries high mortality with most patients dying early. (2) Radiological features of melioidosis pneumonia are non-specific. (3) Clinicians who treat patients from SE Asia need to be aware of this condition to institute early and appropriate antibiotic therapy."

Chest X-rays and CT scan revealed multiple bilateral cavitary lesions in the lungs. Ultrasonography and CT scan showed numerous subcentimetric spleen abscesses. Burkholderia pseudomallei was isolated from the cutaneous lesions and sputum and thus melioidosis was diagnosed. A 6-week course of i.v. ceftazidime plus oral doxycycline was given during the acute phase of the illness. The in vitro susceptibility testing showed that long-term (20 weeks) antimicrobial therapy with doxycycline and moxifloxacin was required.

METHODS: A prospective study was performed of all adult patients with CAP admitted to the Royal Darwin Hospital, a major hospital in tropical northern Australia. A standard definition of CAP was used and data collected on demographics, risk factors, history, examination, investigations, treatment and outcome. Locally-developed treatment guidelines were used. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven adults were included in the analysis. Aboriginal people were over-represented, younger and were more likely to have risk factors for CAP. The most frequent pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Burkholderia pseudomallei. 'Atypical pneumonia' organisms were uncommon. Treatment guidelines included penicillin for mild pneumonia but emphasised coverage of Burkholderia pseudomallei in those with risk factors, especially during the monsoon season. The mortality rate from pneumonia was low with three deaths in 167 cases (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: International guidelines for the management of CAP have been based on populations and organisms from temperate regions and may not necessarily be applicable to tropical regions. Guidelines based upon local epidemiology must therefore be developed. This study illustrates how mortality can be minimised using a process of determining local CAP etiology, developing treatment guidelines and auditing patient management."

Patients averaged 50 years of age and half worked as farmers. The male to female ratio was between 2 and 3 to 1 depending on the subgrouping. Burkholderia pseudomallei was confirmed by a culture or a four-fold rise in titer in the majority of cases, while the others were presumptive diagnoses based on response to treatment. Pulmonary melioidosis presented as either acute fulminant pneumonia or as an indolent disease. The common concurrent medical illness was diabetes mellitus. Mean incubation of the acute vs the sub-acute/chronic form was 8.7 vs 54.4 days, respectively. Leukocytosis was detected in 70% of cases. Sputum Gram's stain was not sensitive for diagnosis. Sputum culture and blood culture were diagnostic for 31.1 vs 22.2 and 40 vs 37.5% of the acute vs subacute/chronic forms, respectively. The common radiographic patterns for acute pneumonia were localized patchy alveolar infiltrate or hematogenous pattern. A bilateral diffuse patchy alveolar infiltration or multiple nodular lesions characterized the latter. Upper-lobe involvement with early cavitation and rapid progression were common. In the subacute/chronic forms, the radiographic pattern sometimes mimicked tuberculosis, with upper lobe involvement, patchy alveolar infiltrate with cavities or fibroreticular lesions. In approximately 30% of cases, liver and/or splenic abscess were common sites of extrapulmonary infection. Respiratory failure and septic shock from acute pulmonary melioidosis was 20% fatal. Early empirical antibiotic therapy should be given for severe pneumonia."

This study was conducted to determine the pattern of microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients admitted to Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, between January 2001 and December 2002. Altogether, 254 patients (124 males, 130 females) averaging 56.4 (SD 19.8) years were included. Eighty-six of them (33.8%) presented with severe CAP on initial clinical presentation. The etiologies for the CAP cases were discovered by isolating the organisms from the blood, sputum, pleural fluid, and other sterile sites. Serology for Chlamydia pneunmoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed to diagnose current infection. The causative organisms were identified in 145 patients (57.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest pathogen, identified in 11.4% of the cases, followed by Burkholderia pseudomallei (11.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.2%). The atypical pathogens, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, accounted for 8.7% and 3.9% of the isolates, respectively. Sixteen patients (6.3%) had dual infections; C. pneumoniae was the most frequent coinfecting pathogen. The average length of hospital stay was 12.9 (SD 14.0) days, with 27.9% staying more than 2 weeks. Overall, 83.9% of the patients improved with treatment, 10.2% did not improve and 5.9% died. The most common complications were acute respiratory failure (31.1%) and septic shock (20.9%). We conclude that initial antibiotic use should cover the atypical pathogens, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, in hospitalized CAP patients. B. pseudomallei is an endemic pathogen in Northeast Thailand, and should be considered in cases of severe CAP."

It is regarded as endemic in southeast Asia and northern Australia. The septicaemic form is a severe illness with a high mortality. The tsunami in 2004 has renewed its current importance. CASE REPORT: A 57 year old man was admitted to hospital with a 2 week history of fever, productive cough and progressive weight loss. On admission he was in septic shock and respiratory failures secondary to a left lower lobe community acquired pneumonia. This progressed to a left sided empyema. Bp was isolated from blood cultures and the pleural pus. Initial intensive therapy with ceftazidime and cotrimoxazole for 4 weeks, followed by cotrimoxazole alone for 20 weeks, led to complete recovery with little residual radiological abnormality. Follow up gave no evidence of relapse but revealed an operable, squamous cell, bronchial carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Melliodosis seems to be an emerging disease in New Caledonia with 10 cases identified since 1999. A favourable climate and possibly an animal reservoir might explain sporadic cases in this region. It is important for the medical profession to be aware of this disease in order to ensure the rapid and correct management of patients whose life is at risk."

METHODOLOGY: From January 2001 to December 2005, we reviewed case reports of all bacteraemic melioidosis admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients had positive blood culture for meliodosis and 27 case reports were traceable for further analysis. The mean age was 46.8 + 20.0 years. Twenty patients (74.1%) were male. The main clinical presentation was fever that occurred in 23 (85.2%) patients. Eighteen patients (66.7%) had lung involvement and three patients had liver abscess. Two patients presented with scrotal swelling, one of whom further developed Fournier's Gangrene. Nineteen (70.4%) patients had underlying diabetes, five of whom were newly diagnosed during the admission. Thirteen (48.1%) patients were treated with high-dose ceftazidime and six (22.2%) patients were treated with imipenem. Eight (29.6%) patients were not given anti-melioidosis therapy because the causative agents were not identified until after the patients died. The patients were admitted 16.8 days + 18.1. Seventeen patients (63.0%) died in this series, 13 patients of whom died within four days of admission. CONCLUSIONS: The wide range of clinical presentations and the fatal outcomes of melioidosis require a high level of suspicion among physicians to develop an early appropriate therapy and reduce the mortality rate."

METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 15 patients suffered from acute melioid CAP. Comparison with 60 patients with severe CAP of causes other than melioidosis, revealed that visit to the ED in the rainy season, shock on arrival, diabetes, poor sugar control with glycemia &gt;=250mg/dl, chest radiograph with cavity formation, and poor clinical outcome, were significantly predominant in patients with acute melioid CAP.

Knowledge of pathogens causing CAP constitutes the basis for   selection of antimicrobial treatment. Previous data have shown that etiological agents can   be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase   chain reaction (PCR). This study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time PCR as a   method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of CAP (Streptococcus   pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely Mycoplasma   pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila) in CAP patients   attending Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA)/ Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia. Two previously   developed multiplex real-time PCR assays, duplex for the differential detection of S.   pneumoniae and B. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used   to detect a bacterial cause of CAP in blood and respiratory samples. Thus, 46 blood and 45   respiratory samples collected from 46 adult CAP patients admitted to HTAA were analysed by   multiplex real-time PCR assays and conventional methods. The microbial etiology of CAP   could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of CAP patients by conventional methods and this was   increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time PCR.

Studies have established that, while uncommon in the Port Moresby region, melioidosis is an important cause of pneumonia and sepsis in the Balimo region of Western Province. Phylogenetic analyses of strains of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Papua New Guinea have shown them to be more closely related to strains of B. pseudomallei from Australia than to strains from Southeast Asia. This is consistent with the proposed origins of B. pseudomallei in Australia, with subsequent spread out of Australia to Southeast Asia during the last ice age. Further surveillance across Papua New Guinea is likely to unmask other locations where B. pseudomallei occurs in the environment and where melioidosis is currently not being diagnosed."

Etiological data for Cambodia is scarce. We aimed to describe the main etiological agents causing CAP, and their resistance patterns in Cambodia and the greater Mekong region. METHODS: A review of bacterial etiologies of CAP and antimicrobial resistance in Cambodia and neighboring countries was conducted via: (1) a systematic review of published literature in all NCBI databases using Pubmed, Google scholar, EMBASE, the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Ministry of Health libraries; (2) a review of unpublished data from Cambodia provided by national and international stakeholders working at different tiers of the healthcare system. RESULTS: Twenty three articles and five data sources reported etiologies for 5919 CAP patients diagnosed between May 1995 and December 2012, including 1421 (24.0%), 3571 (60.3%) and 927 (15.7%) from Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens ranking among the five most prevalent in 12 and 10 studies, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria such as Burkholderia pseudomallei and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also frequently diagnosed, particularly in bacteremic CAP in Thai adults and Cambodian children. In Thailand and Vietnam, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were frequently identified in settings using indirect laboratory testing. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis, CAP data in Cambodia seems to present etiological and resistance profiles comparable to those of neighboring countries. Findings have been shared with the national authorities upon the revision of the national therapeutic guidelines and were disseminated using a specially created website."

Appropriate empirical treatment depends on knowledge of the pathogens commonly responsible. However, assessing the aetiological significance of identified organisms is often difficult, particularly with sputum isolates that might represent contamination with oropharyngeal flora. METHODS: A systematic review of all adult CAP aetiology studies from Asia, excluding the Middle East, published in English between 1 January 1990 and 1 March 2012 was conducted. Forty-eight studies reporting on 10 423 patients were included, representing data from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Data from large parts of Asia were unavailable and there was substantial heterogeneity in methodology. RESULTS: As in western studies, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae were all significant pathogens. However, compared with western studies, S. pneumoniae was of less relative importance. Gram-negative bacilli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were more important, and in northeast Thailand Burkholderia pseudomallei was a major pathogen. CONCLUSION: These data have major implications for diagnostic strategies and empirical treatment. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeting S. pneumoniae may be inappropriate in many Asian settings, and agents active against TB may lead to partial response and delayed TB diagnosis."

","SPECIES:Burkholderia pseudomalleiID:25643275TITLE:Melioidosis: evolving concepts in epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment.ABSTRACT:Infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei can result in asymptomatic seroconversion, a single skin lesion that may or may not heal spontaneously, a pneumonia which can be subacute or chronic and mimic tuberculosis or rapidly progressive resulting in fatal overwhelming sepsis. Latency with subsequent activation of disease is well recognized, but very uncommon. Melioidosis also has a myriad of other clinical presentations and diagnosis is often delayed because of this and because of difficulties with laboratory diagnosis and lack of recognition outside melioidosis-endemic regions. The perception of B. pseudomallei as a top tier biothreat agent has driven large funding for research, yet resources for diagnosis and therapy of melioidosis in many endemic locations remain extremely limited, with mortality as high as 50% in comparison to around 10% in regions where state-of-the-art intensive care therapy for sepsis is available. Fatal melioidosis is extremely unlikely from natural infection in a healthy person, provided the diagnosis is made early, ceftazidime or meropenem is commenced and intensive care therapy is available. While biothreat research is directed toward potential aerosol exposure to B. pseudomallei, the overall proportion of melioidosis cases resulting from inhalation rather than from percutaneous inoculation remains entirely uncertain, although the epidemiology supports a shift to inhalation during severe weather events such as cyclones and typhoons. What makes B. pseudomallei such a dangerous organism for patients with diabetes and other selective risk factors remains unclear, but microbial genome-wide association studies linking clinical aspects of melioidosis cases to nonubiquitous or polymorphic B. pseudomallei genes or genomic islands are beginning to uncover specific virulence signatures. Finally, what also remains uncertain is the global phylogeography of B. pseudomallei and whether melioidosis is spreading beyond historical locations or is just being unmasked in Africa and the Americas by better recognition and increased surveillance.

Pulmonary melioidosis typically presents as acute bacterial pneumonia or cavitary lung lesions resembling tuberculosis. CASE REPORT: We report melioidosis in a 70-year-old active smoker from Mexico with no history of travel to disease-endemic areas. The patient presented with a left supraclavicular abscess and a non-cavitary, left lung mass encasing a pulmonary vein. Incision and drainage of the patient's subcutaneous abscess isolated B. pseudomallei, and fine-needle aspiration of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes revealed the presence of intracellular gram-negative bacilli with no evidence of malignancy. Biochemical tests determined that the strain the patient acquired from Mexico is identical to only 1 other isolate from Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the blurring epidemiological borders of this organism, its rare presentation mimicking lung malignancy, and an aggressive antimicrobial treatment that resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms."

The incidence in Thailand is 4.4/1000000 inhabitants, where it causes 19% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 20% of bacteremic pneumonia, and the mortality is 50%. Sporadic cases have been described in Central and South America. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features and ecological characteristics of melioidosis in Antioquia, Colombia. METHODS: This is a case series description. RESULTS: Seven cases were identified. Burkholderia pseudomallei was isolated from peripheral blood, pleural fluid, and urine and was identified by the automated system VITEK 2 (bioMerieux) and API 20NE biochemical kit. Five of the cases had a bacteremic form with shock and pulmonary compromise and two of these patients died. The non-bacteremic melioidosis cases had genitourinary, abdominal, and osteoarticular compromise. All patients had comorbidities and lived in rural hot and humid areas in the west central region of Colombia (Antioquia). Diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, and other chronic diseases are important risk factors for the development of severe forms. CONCLUSIONS: The cases presented here are similar to those occurring in endemic areas regarding comorbidity, risk factors, clinical presentation, and environmental conditions. It is necessary to establish whether melioidosis is an endemic and under-diagnosed disease or an emerging disease in Colombia."

Melioidosis is endemic to areas of northern Australia and Southeast Asia. With increasing international travel and migration, imported cases of melioidosis are being reported regularly. Here, we summarize the 11 cases of melioidosis reported in South Korea from 2003 to 2014. METHODS: Tracing epidemiological investigations were performed on every patient reported to the National Surveillance System since 2011. A systematic literature search was performed to identify melioidosis cases that occurred prior to 2011. RESULTS: The overall fatality rate was 36.4%. All the patients had visited Southeast Asia where melioidosis is endemic. The stay in the endemic region ranged from 4 days to 20 years. Of the seven patients who developed initial symptoms after returning to South Korea, the time interval between returning to South Korea and symptom onset ranged from 1 day to 3 years. The remaining four patients developed symptoms during their stay in the endemic region and were diagnosed with melioidosis in South Korea. Seven (63.6%) patients possessed at least one risk factor, all of whom were diabetic. Pneumonia was the most frequent clinical manifestation, but the patients showed a wide spectrum of clinical features, including internal organ abscesses, a mycotic aneurysm of the aorta, and coinfection with tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: An early diagnosis and initiation of the appropriate antibiotics can reduce the mortality of melioidosis. Consequently, increased awareness of the risk factors and clinical features of melioidosis is required."

Recent isolation of the organism in the soil of Kapasia, Gazipur, Bangladesh has proven its exposure among the population residing in endemic areas of our country. Pneumonia is the most common presentation of melioidosis. Acute, subacute and chronic pneumonia due to B. pseudomallei can present as primary or secondary pneumonia. Treatment of such cases are challenging as well. Till date, few cases of acute and chronic pneumonia due to melioidosis occurring in local Bangladeshis as well as in returning travelers to Europe have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of primary melioidosis pneumonia declared cured after a 27 weeks of treatment regimen from Bangladesh. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old Bangladeshi gentleman, known diabetic, hypertensive, smoker, presented with the complaints of recurrent episodes of low to high grade intermittent fever, productive cough with occasional haemoptysis and 10 kg weight loss over one and half months. Poorly responding to conventional antibiotics, he was suspected as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis. Examination and investigations revealed left sided consolidation with cavitary lesion, hepato-splenomegaly and sputum analysis confirmed growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient was successfully treated as a case of primary melioidosis pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Often misdiagnosed and empirically treated as tuberculosis, untreated melioidosis pneumonia may even lead to death. Therefore, melioidosis should be suspected in appropriate clinical scenario in patients with a history of residing in or traveling to endemic areas. In Bangladesh, time has come to explore whether melioidosis should be considered as an emerging infectious disease."

RESULTS: Principal presentations in patients were lung infection in 65 (41.1 %), skin infection in 44 (27.8 %), septic arthritis/osteomyelitis in 20 (12.7 %) and liver infection in 19 (12.0 %). Bacteremic melioidosis was seen in most of patients (n = 121, 76.6 %). Focal melioidosis was seen in 124 (78.5 %) of patients and multi-focal melioidosis was reported in 45 (28.5 %) cases. Melioidosis with no evident focus was in 34 (21.5 %) patients. Fifty-four (34.2 %) patients developed septic shock. Internal organ abscesses and secondary foci in lungs and/or soft tissue were common. A total of 67 (41 %) cases presented during the monsoonal wet season. Death due to melioidosis was reported in 52 (32.9 %) patients, while relapses were occurred in 11 (7.0 %). Twelve fatal melioidosis cases seen in this study were directly attributed to the absence of prompt acute-phase treatment. Predisposing risk factors were reported in most of patients (n = 133, 84.2 %) and included diabetes (74.7 %), immune disturbances (9.5 %), cancer (4.4 %) and chronic kidney disease (11.4 %). On multivariate analysis, the only independent predictors of mortality were the presence of at least one co-morbid factor (OR 3.0; 95 % CI 1.1-8.4), the happening of septic shock (OR 16.5; 95 % CI 6.1-44.9) and age &gt; 40 years (OR 6.47; 95 % CI 1.7-23.8).

As diagnostic tools have increased in sensitivity, our understanding of the etiology of CAP has begun to change with a significant increase in confirmed viral infections and the recognition that multiple pathogens are frequently present. Empiric therapy remains the standard of care and guidelines are mostly based on published data from the United States or Europe. Blindly applying guidelines without any consideration of local etiological differences can lead to a risk of under or overtreatment. Several pathogens are particularly problematic in the setting of CAP in some regions as they are not covered by standard guidelines; in particular, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Acinetobacter baumanii. Overtreatment of patients meeting guideline criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia is also a problem as this categorization probably only applies to a limited number of areas in the United States. New pathogens are emerging more frequently, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza A H1N1 09, and avian influenza, all of which have global ramifications and good clinicians need to stay informed of evolving threats. There are clearly differences in outcomes from CAP across the globe, but accurately comparing them is difficult given the vast differences in age, comorbidities, and access to healthcare.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to review case reports of melioidosis from Malaysia. METHODS: We conducted a computerized search of literature resources including PubMed, OVID, Scopus, MEDLINE and the COCHRANE database to identify published case reports from 1975 to 2015. We abstracted information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, comorbid conditions, management and outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 67 cases were reported with 29 (43%) deaths; the median age was 44 years, and a male preponderance (84%) was noted. Forty-one cases (61%) were bacteremic, and fatal septic shock occurred in 13 (19%) within 24-48 hours of admission; nine of the 13 cases were not specifically treated for melioidosis as confirmatory evidence was available only after death. Diabetes mellitus (n = 36, 54%) was the most common risk factor. Twenty-six cases (39%) had a history of exposure to contaminated soil/water or employment in high-risk occupations. Pneumonia (n = 24, 36%) was the most common primary clinical presentation followed by soft tissue abscess (n = 22, 33%). Other types of clinical presentations were less common-genitourinary (n = 5), neurological (n = 5), osteomyelitis/septic arthritis (n = 4) and skin (n = 2); five cases had no evidence of a focus of infection. With regard to internal foci of infection, abscesses of the subcutaneous tissue (n = 14, 21%) was the most common followed by liver (18%); abscesses of the spleen and lung were the third most common (12% each). Seven of 56 males were reported to have prostatic abscesses. Mycotic pseudoaneurysm occurred in five cases. Only one case of parotid abscess was reported in an adult. Of the 67 cases, 13 were children (&lt;= 18 years of age) with seven deaths; five of the 13 were neonates presenting primarily with bronchopneumonia, four of whom died. Older children had a similar presentation as adults; no case of parotid abscess was reported among children. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical patterns of cases reported from Malaysia are consistent for the most part from previous case reports from South and Southeast Asia with regard to common primary presentations of pneumonia and soft tissue abscesses, and diabetes as a major risk factor. Bacteremic melioidosis carried a poor prognosis and septic shock was strong predictor of mortality. Differences included the occurrence of: primary neurological infection was higher in Malaysia compared to reports outside Malaysia; internal foci of infection such as abscesses of the liver, spleen, prostate, and mycotic pseudoaneurysms were higher than previously reported in the region. No parotid abscess was reported among children. Early recognition of the disease is the cornerstone of management. In clinical situations of community-acquired sepsis and/or pneumonia, where laboratory bacteriological confirmation is not possible, empirical treatment with antimicrobials for B. pseudomallei is recommended."

Burkholderia pseudomallei (a gram-negative bacterium) is the major causative agent for melioidosis, which is prevalent in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Northern Australia. Melioidosis patients are increasingly being recognized in other parts of the world. The bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents, but prolonged treatment, especially with combinations of antibiotics, may be effective. Despite therapy, the overall case fatality rate of septicemia in melioidosis remains significantly high. Intracellular survival of the bacteria within macrophages may progress to chronic infections, and about 10% of patients suffer relapses. In the coming decades, melioidosis will increasingly afflict travelers throughout many global regions. Clinicians managing travelers returning from the subtropics or tropics with severe pneumonia or septicemia should consider acute melioidosis as a differential diagnosis. Patients with open skin wounds, diabetes, or chronic renal disease are at higher risk for melioidosis and should avoid direct contact with soil and standing water in endemic regions.

METHODS: Clinical specimens (n = 525) obtained from patients presenting at a tertiary care hospital of South India with clinical symptoms suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, superficial or internal abscesses, chronic skin ulcers and bone or joint infections were tested for the presence of Burkholderia pseudomallei using conventional culture (CC), enrichment culture (EC) and PCR. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CC and PCR were initially deduced using EC as the gold standard method. Further, diagnostic accuracies of all the three methods were analysed using Bayesian latent class modelling (BLCM). RESULTS: Detection rates of B. pseudomallei using CC, EC and PCR were 3.8%, 5.3% and 6%, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of CC and PCR were 71.4, 98.4% and 100 and 99.4%, respectively in comparison with EC as the gold standard test. With Bayesian latent class modelling, EC and PCR demonstrated sensitivities of 98.7 and 99.3%, respectively, while CC showed a sensitivity of 70.3% for detection of B. pseudomallei. An increase of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.08-4.32%) in the case detection rate of melioidosis was observed in the study population when EC and/or PCR were used in adjunct to the conventional culture technique. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings underscore the diagnostic superiority of enrichment culture and/or PCR over conventional microbiological culture for improved case detection of melioidosis from non-blood clinical specimens."

This trip included construction and agricultural activities and recreational mud exposures. The patient subsequently developed right inguinal lymphadenopathy and worsening abscesses, which prompted specimen collection for culture on August 25. This specimen was sent to a commercial laboratory in New Jersey, which identified Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative organism of melioidosis, on August 30. The patient did not experience pneumonia or bacteremia, and recovered fully after 2 weeks of intensive therapy with parenteral ceftazidime and a 6-month outpatient course of eradication therapy with doxycycline."

Melioidosis, a serious infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, is highly endemic in South and Southeast Asia and northern Australia. We reviewed the medical charts of adult patients admitted with bacterial septic arthritis at Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, northeast Thailand from January 2012 to December 2014. Bacterial septic arthritis was defined as one or more hot swollen joints with isolation of a pathogenic organism from an affected joint or from blood. A total of 154 patients with septic arthritis were retrospectively evaluated. The most common causes were B. pseudomallei (48%, N = 74), Streptococcus spp. (29%, N = 44), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%, N = 16). Prevalence of diabetes, bacteremia, and pneumonia was higher in B. pseudomallei septic arthritis than in septic arthritis caused by the other bacteria (all P &lt; 0.01). Seventy three percent (54/74) of patients infected with B. pseudomallei and 69% (55/80) of patients with the other bacteria received effective antimicrobials on the first day of admission (P = 0.60), but in-hospital mortality of the former group was considerably higher (34% versus 14%, P = 0.004). In conclusion, B. pseudomallei septic arthritis is common and associated with high mortality in northeast Thailand. Emergence of Streptococcus arthritis is observed. Difficulty in diagnosing melioidosis and identifying B. pseudomallei in areas where health care workers are not familiar with the disease is discussed. In melioidosis-endemic regions, parenteral ceftazidime could be considered as empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with septic arthritis and underlying diseases."

Main mode of transmission is via percutaneous inoculation. Pneumonia is the most common presentation in acute disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33 year old previously healthy Sinhalese female with an occupational exposure to surface water in paddy fields, who was on postpartum day 6 following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery via an elective caesarian section. She presented with a 1 day history of breathlessness, preceded by a brief episode of fever. She had occasional right side coarse crackles and pitting oedema of both lower limbs. Shortly after admission, she developed type one respiratory failure needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Initial chest x-ray revealed slight obliteration of right medial diaphragmatic border while echocardiogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram excluded a pulmonary embolism, but revealed bilateral multi-lobar consolidation. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis with renal abscesses. As initial cultures were inconclusive, melioidosis antibody levels were done due to high degree of suspicion, which was found to be positive with a titer of 1:2560. A diagnosis of melioidosis was made based on the suggestive clinical picture, exposure history and the highly positive antibody level. She developed left side focal seizures together with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anemia, suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was negative for cerebral abscesses but revealed extensive minute haemorrhagic foci throughout the cerebrum. Thus, the final diagnosis was acute melioidosis causing pneumonia and renal abscesses, complicated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and sepsis. She demonstrated dramatic response to high dose meropenem and co-trimoxazole along with plasmapheresis. Four weeks after treatment, the antibody titer came down to 1:320. Melioidosis antibody was absent in the baby. CONCLUSIONS: This case was challenging as it was an atypical presentation of melioidosis during postpartum leading to a diagnostic conundrum. This highlights the need to look into the effect of pregnancy and postpartum as added risk factors. High index of suspicion is necessary to avoid diagnostic delays."

A case report.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Despite, Sri Lanka lies in the melioidosis endemic belt between 5 N and 10 N surrounded by countries known to have endemic melioidosis for many years, comparatively fewer cases of melioidosis infection have been reported in Sri Lanka. Melioidosis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, ranging from severe pneumonia to abscess formation in various organs. Isolated septic arthritis, which is a rare but well-recognized manifestation of melioidosis, could be the sole presenting problem in some patients with melioidosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a middle aged diabetic female who has been on azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with pain and swelling of left hip joint. Investigations confirmed the clinical suspicion of septic arthritis, but all relevant microbiological investigations failed to isolate a causative organism. Due to the history of diabetes, possible immunosuppression with azathioprine, and failure to recognise the possible causative organism by initial investigations prompted us to investigate for melioidosis. Diagnosis of melioidosis was made by presence high titre of antibodies to melioidin antigen, and rapid response to appropriate treatment. The patient was treated with intravenous imipenem 1000 mg 6 hourly and oral cotrimoxazole (1920 mg 12 hourly) for 4 weeks followed by eradication therapy with cotrimoxazole and doxycycline. CONCLUSION: Given that melioidosis-induced septic arthritis share common features with septic arthritis due to other common pyogenic bacteria, differentiation of these two conditions is extremely difficult. Therefore, melioidosis needs to be considered as a possibility, when a patient with risk factors for melioidosis such as diabetes or immunosuppression presents with isolated septic arthritis. This case report has been presented to raise the awareness of an unusual presentation of melioidosis; isolated septic arthritis."

We provide updated estimates of melioidosis bacteremia incidence and in-hospital mortality rate using integration of two population-based surveillance databases in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, since automated blood culture became available in 2005. From 2009 to 2013, 564 hospitalized bacteremic melioidosis patients were identified. The annual incidence of bacteremic melioidosis ranged from 14 to 17 per 100,000 persons, and average population mortality rate was 2 per 100,000 persons per year. In-hospital mortality rate declined nonsignificantly from 15% (15/102) to 13% (15/118). Of 313 (56%) bacteremic melioidosis patients who met criteria for acute lower respiratory infection and were included in the hospital-based pneumonia surveillance system, 65% (202/313) had a chest radiograph performed within 48 hours of admission; 46% (92/202) showed radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Annual incidence of bacteremic melioidosis with pneumonia was 2.4 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence intervals; 1.9-2.9). In-hospital death was more likely among bacteremic melioidosis patients with pneumonia (34%; 20/59) compared with non-pneumonia patients (18%; 59/321) (P-value = 0.007). The overall mortality could have been as high as 46% (257/564) if patients with poor clinical condition at the time of discharge had died. The continued high incidence of bacteremic melioidosis, pneumonia, and deaths in an endemic area highlights the need for early diagnosis and treatment and additional interventions for the prevention and control for melioidosis."

Poorly controlled diabetes is a known risk factor. Melioidosis has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from a localized abscess to pneumonia to disseminated sepsis with multiorgan failure. Pyrexia of unknown origin is a common presentation. Abscesses in unusual anatomical locations are well known to be associated with melioidosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 64-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese man with prolonged fever and constitutional symptoms with a neglected swelling over the back of the scalp who was found to have an abscess in the subgaleal space of the scalp during surgical drainage. Burkholderia pseudomallei was isolated in pus culture, and melioidosis serology was highly positive. The patient was treated with ceftazidime for 2 weeks, followed by co-trimoxazole for another 3 months. He made a complete clinical recovery with normalization of inflammatory markers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of subgaleal abscess following melioidosis infection reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Abscesses in anatomically unusual locations should raise suspicion for melioidosis infection, particularly among patients with risk factors such as diabetes mellitus."

In Malaysia, cystic fibrosis (CF) is an uncommon condition. The association between CF and B.pseudomallei infections has been reported previously. However, this is the first case report of a pediatric melioidosis relapse and co-infection with other Gram-negative bacteria in Malaysia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Chinese Malaysian boy presented with a history of recurrent pneumonia, poor growth and steatorrhoea since childhood, and was diagnosed with CF. B. pseudomallei was cultured from his sputum during three different admissions between 2013 and 2016. However, the patient succumbed to end stage of respiratory failure in 2017 despite antibiotics treatment against B.pseudomallei. The isolates were compared using multilocus-sequence typing and repetitive-element polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and confirmed that two of the isolates were of same sequence type, which may indicate relapse. CONCLUSIONS: CF patients should be aware of melioidosis in endemic regions, as it is an emerging infectious disease, especially when persistent or recurrent respiratory symptoms and signs of infection occur. The high prevalence rates of melioidosis in Malaysia warrants better management options to improve quality of life, and life expectancy in patients with CF. Travel activities to endemic regions should also be given more consideration, as this would be crucial to identify and initiate appropriate empiric treatment."

It has never been heard of by the majority of doctors and has as yet failed to gain the attention of national Ministries of Health and country offices of the World Health Organization (WHO). Although a few centers are diagnosing increasing numbers of cases, and the mortality documented from these institutions is relatively high (nearly 20%), the true burden of the disease remains unknown. In India, most cases have been reported from southwestern coastal Karnataka and northeastern Tamil Nadu, although this probably simply reflects the presence of centers of excellence and researchers with an interest in the disease. As elsewhere, the majority of cases have type 2 diabetes mellitus and occupational exposure to the environment. Most present with community-acquired pneumonia and/or bacteremia, especially during heavy rainfall. The high seropositivity rate (29%) in Karnataka and isolation of B. pseudomallei from the environment in Tamil Nadu and Kerala confirm India as melioidosis-endemic, although the full extent of the distribution of the organism across the country is unknown. There are limited molecular epidemiological data, but, thus far, the majority of Indian isolates have appeared distinct from those from South East Asia and Australia. Among other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are known to be melioidosis-endemic, but there are no cases that have conclusively proved to have been acquired in Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan or Pakistan. There are no surveillance systems in place for melioidosis in South Asian countries. However, over the past two years, researchers at the Center for Emerging and Tropical Diseases of Kasturba Medical College, University of Manipal, have established the Indian Melioidosis Research Forum (IMRF), held the first South Asian Melioidosis Congress, and have been working to connect researchers, microbiologists and physicians in India and elsewhere in South Asia to raise awareness through training initiatives, the media, workshops, and conferences, with the hope that more patients with melioidosis will be diagnosed and treated appropriately. However, much more work needs to be done before we will know the true burden and distribution of melioidosis across South Asia."

In non-endemic areas, a misdiagnosis can lead to a fatal outcome. This study aims to identify the main characteristics of imported and diagnosed melioidosis cases in Europe to increase clinician's awareness of this diagnosis. A literature review of imported and diagnosed human melioidosis cases in Europe was performed. PubMed and Web of Science search engines were used for retrieving articles from 2000 to November 2018. Seventy-seven cases of imported melioidosis into Europe described in the literature were identified. More than half of the cases were acquired in Thailand (53%) by men (73%). Patients were usually exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei during a holiday stay (58%) of less than 1 month (23%) and were hospitalized during the month following their return to Europe (58%). Among travelers, melioidosis is less often associated with risk factor (16%), diabetes being the most frequently comorbidity related (19%). The clinical presentation was multifaceted, pneumonia being the most common symptom (52%), followed by cardiovascular form (45%) and skin and soft tissues damages (35%). The diagnosis was obtained by culture (92%), often supplemented by morphological, biochemical, and molecular identification (23%). Misdiagnoses were common (21%). Over half of the patients received a complete and adapted treatment (56%). Mortality is lower for returning traveler (6%). Imported melioidosis cases into Europe have their own characteristics.

A total of 28 melioidosis cases were reported in Brazil until 2015. The majority of melioidosis cases were reported in the Northwest region of Brazil and such cases were not previously detected in the Midwest region of Brazil. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old man was admitted with a non-productive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, diffuse abdominal pain. Pulmonary auscultation revealed a vesicular murmur, snoring sounds, and the presence of basal crackling rales in the left hemithorax. The patient evolved with several respiratory failures and he was diagnosed as the first case of community-acquired pneumonia with sepsis caused by B pseudomallei in Mato Grosso do Sul, Midwest state of Brazil. DIAGNOSIS: The cell isolates were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing to confirm the bacterial species. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and meropenem stabilized the clinical condition of the patient.

It is often fatal, with a high prevalence in tropical areas. Clinical presentation can vary from abscess formation to pneumonia and sepsis. We assessed the global burden of melioidosis, expressed in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), for 2015. METHODS: We did a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature for human melioidosis cases between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015. Quantitative data for cases of melioidosis were extracted, including mortality, age, sex, infectious and post-infectious sequelae, antibiotic treatment, and symptom duration. These data were combined with established disability weights and expert panel discussions to construct an incidence-based disease model. The disease model was integrated with established global incidence and mortality estimates to calculate global melioidosis DALYs. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018106372. FINDINGS: 2888 articles were screened, of which 475 eligible studies containing quantitative data were retained. Pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, and sepsis were the most common outcomes, with pneumonia occurring in 3633 (35 7%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 34 8-36 6) of 10 175 patients, intra-abdominal abscess in 1619 (18 3%, 17 5-19 1) of 8830 patients, and sepsis in 1526 (18 0%, 17 2-18 8) of 8469 patients. We estimate that in 2015, the global burden of melioidosis was 4 6 million DALYs (UI 3 2-6 6) or 84 3 per 100 000 people (57 5-120 0). Years of life lost accounted for 98 9% (UI 97 7-99 5) of the total DALYs, and years lived with disability accounted for 1 1% (0 5-2 3). INTERPRETATION: Melioidosis causes a larger disease burden than many other tropical diseases that are recognised as neglected, and so it should be reconsidered as a major neglected tropical disease.

Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis) is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the tropics. Selective medium is recommended for laboratory diagnosis with non-sterile respiratory samples, while PCR is not routinely used due to variable reported performance. The effectiveness of these diagnostic modalities varies by site.Aim. To compare selective media and real-time PCR (qPCR) with routine media in detecting B. pseudomallei in CAP respiratory samples in a low-incidence setting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Methodology. Respiratory samples were routinely cultured on blood, chocolate and MacConkey agar (RESP-ROUTINE), and compared to culture on selective Ashdown medium (RESP-SELECTIVE) and qPCR. The gold standard was routine culture of B. pseudomallei from any site (ALL-ROUTINE).Results . B. pseudomallei was detected in 8/204 (3.9 %) samples. Overall sensitivity rates differed (P=0.03) for qPCR (100%), RESP-SELECTIVE (87.5%) and RESP-ROUTINE (50%). There was a trend towards lower median days to positive culture for RESP-SELECTIVE (1 day) compared to RESP-ROUTINE (2 days, P=0.08) and ALL-ROUTINE (2 days, P=0.06). Reagent costs for each additional detection were USD59 for RESP-SELECTIVE and USD354 for PCR.Conclusions. In a low-incidence setting, selective culture of respiratory samples on Ashdown was more sensitive and allowed quicker identification than routine media, at reasonable cost. Blood cultures are critical, confirming four cases missed by routine respiratory culture. Selective medium is useful in early pneumonia (pre-sepsis) and resource-limited settings where blood cultures are infrequently done. Real-time PCR is costly, but highly sensitive and useful for high-risk patients with diabetes, cancer or immunosuppressants, or requiring ventilation or intensive care."

She also had a loss of appetite and weight. She had oral ulcers and bilateral blepharitis. Dermatological examination revealed multiple tender papules with a mamillated appearance and targetoid lesions with a yellowish centre over the face, upper trunk and upper limbs. She also had multiple tender subcutaneous nodules over the extensor aspect of upper limbs. Her inflammatory markers were significantly elevated. Aspirate from a submental lymph node abscess revealed the growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis antibody titer was > 10,240. The histology of the skin lesions of the face and left forearm showed a prominent neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis and the morphological features were in favour of Sweet syndrome with panniculitis. She was started on intravenous meropenem 2 g daily and showed rapid clinical improvement with the disappearance of skin lesions as well as a reduction in inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: Sweet syndrome is an uncommon inflammatory disorder known to be associated with upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections, malignancies and the use of certain drugs. Melioidosis is an emerging infection with various cutaneous manifestations. This is the first case of melioidosis causing the secondary sweet syndrome. It emphasizes the importance of considering melioidosis as a potential aetiology in patients with Sweet syndrome."

It is a soil and water pathogen and transmitted to humans through inoculation or inhalation. This disease is considered endemic in India and largely remains under reported. The most common presentation is pneumonia and bacteraemia, which can present acutely and as septic shock. Chronic presentation include-abscess, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis. The major risk factors are diabetes, liver disease, renal disease, chronic lung disease. In this article 18 cases have been reviewed; their clinical features, treatment and outcome are discussed. This is to highlight the varied presentations, high degree of clinical suspicion needed to suspect and start empiric therapy, good microbiological support to arrive at right diagnosis and timely treatment of this infection as it carries high mortality, if left untreated.

","SPECIES:Burkholderia pseudomalleiID:31888746TITLE:Infective myositis, an uncommon presentation of melioidosis: a case report and review of the literature.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Melioidosis is considered endemic in certain areas of the world. Musculoskeletal and soft tissue involvement are relatively uncommon presentations in melioidosis. We present a case of infective myositis in a patient with melioidosis in Sri Lanka, which is not considered an endemic country. Even though multiple cases of melioidosis have been reported with an increasing number in Sri Lanka, infective myositis secondary to melioidosis was not reported previously. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old Sinhalese man with diabetes presented with fever of 4 months' duration and a limp with a painful lump on the right side of the upper thigh of 2 months' duration. He had been treated in a local hospital for community-acquired pneumonia 3 weeks prior to this admission, for which he had received intravenous meropenem and teicoplanin with intensive care unit admission. He had a 0.5-cm x 0.5-cm tender lump over the right vastus lateralis muscle, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the area showed an ill-defined, heterogeneously enhancing, hypodense area involving the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and quadratus femoris, suggestive of infective myositis but without abscess formation. Histopathology of the muscle biopsied from the vastus lateralis showed suppurative inflammation of subcutaneous fat with connective tissue necrosis and muscle infiltrated by lymphocytes. These features are suggestive of infective myositis possibly due to melioidosis. Although the result of a culture taken from the muscle biopsy was negative, the patient's antibody titer was strongly positive for melioidosis. He did not show any other areas with infected foci. He was treated with intravenous meropenem for 2 weeks and responded well. He was discharged with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 6 months as a maintenance therapy. CONCLUSION: Melioidosis is commonly an undiagnosed disease that has a wide variety of clinical presentations. Myositis in melioidosis is uncommon, and careful evaluation is mandatory to avoid misdiagnosis of this treatable but fatal disease. The clinician should have a high index of clinical suspicion, and further clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to determine the true burden of the disease."

Treating melioidosis has been a challenge in district hospitals due to high usage of broad spectrum antibiotics and prolonged hospitalisation. This study is to review the patients' demography, clinical presentations and microbiological data. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out on patients admitted with culture positive for melioidosis from year 2013 to 2017 in Hospital Teluk Intan, Perak. RESULTS: There were a total of 46 confirmed cases of melioidosis. Majority of the patients were working in the agricultural and farming (28.6%), and factories (25.7%). Thirty-one patients had diabetes mellitus (71.1%). Presentations of patients with melioidosis included pneumonia (54.3%), skin and soft tissue infection (19.6%), deep abscesses (15.2%) and bone and joint infections (13%). An average of 5.8 days was needed to confirm the diagnosis of melioidosis via positive culture. However, only 39.4% of these patients were started on ceftazidime or carbapenem as the empirical therapy. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate for melioidosis was 46% and the mortality rate was 52%. Our microbial cultures showed good sensitivity towards cotrimoxazole (97.1%), ceftazidime (100%) and carbapenem (100%). CONCLUSION: Melioidosis carries high mortality rate, especially with lung involvement and bacteremia. Physicians should have high clinical suspicion for melioidosis cases to give appropriate antimelioidosis therapy early."

B. pseudomallei infection, or melioidosis, is difficult to diagnose, and culture remains the gold standard. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential, however, to ensuring appropriate therapy. Ten days after returning from Australia, a Marine presented to a community hospital with massive cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and cough. Computed tomography demonstrated scattered pulmonary infiltrates with small cavitations; lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal nodes; and splenomegaly. Sputum and blood cultures were negative. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftazidime was initiated for suspected melioidosis. Retrospectively, a prototype iSTAT cartridge modified to detect B. pseudomallei capsular polysaccharide antigen was used to test a specimen of the patient's blood and was determined to be positive. Over the course of therapy, B. pseudomallei capsular antigen levels in blood declined as the patient improved. The leveraging of an existing point-of-care (POC) analyzer to create a rapid diagnostic assay for melioidosis provides a template for rapid POC diagnostics that could significantly improve the ability of clinicians to deliver timely and appropriate therapy for serious infections."

Emerging pathogens like Burkholderia pseudomallei is increasingly recognized as an important cause of CAP in Southeast Asian countries. Initial management in the primary care depends on clinical assessment while the hospitalized patients require combinations of clinical scores, chest radiography and various microbiological and biomarker assays. This comprehensive diagnostic approach together with additional sampling and molecular tests in selected high-risk patients should be practiced. Inappropriate therapy in CAP in hospitalized patients lengthens hospital stay and increases cost and mortality. In addition, emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms poses tough challenges in deciding empirical as well as definitive therapy. Developing local evidence on the cause and management should be a priority to improve health outcomes in CAP."

The majority of patients present with pneumonia with or without sepsis, but localized and asymptomatic infection is also well recognized. Recent modeling and epidemiological studies have demonstrated the widespread presence of B. pseudomallei in otherwise unrecognized regions with a predicted mortality of 90,000 deaths worldwide. Innovative environmental studies are also uncovering how hydrodynamic, pedology, fauna, and weather events influence geographic distribution and incidence of melioidosis cases. Of concern is the changes associated with global warming, which will be conducive to B. pseudomallei in combination with the global diabetes pandemic. In fact, over 80% of patient developing melioidosis have underlying comorbidities. For this great mimicker, culture remains the mainstay of diagnosis and despite availability of other assays, challenges still remain in reducing time to diagnosis and avoiding misdiagnosis. With institution of timely antimicrobials such as ceftazidime and supportive intensive care, overall mortality can be reduced to 10%, although this can still be as high as 50% in poorly resourced areas. Promise is on the horizon with the first human vaccine trials being planned for 2021. Meanwhile new multiomics techniques are giving us a better understanding of the role of virulence and host-pathogen interactions on patient outcomes."

He underwent deceased donor kidney transplantation 4 years ago and was on many immunosuppressive agents after transplantation. At presentation, his chest radiograph showed a mass-like lesion in the left upper lobe.

He was diagnosed with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (T4N0M0) co-existing with localized pulmonary melioidosis. After intensive and eradication therapy for melioidosis, his well-being improved with the resolution of fever. He sequentially underwent left upper lobectomy, but the procedure was not accomplished due to severe adhesions surrounding the left lung and great vessels. After surgery, he received concurrent chemoradiation therapy for his lung cancer. Nevertheless, the disease progressed, and he finally passed away.

The Darwin melioidosis treatment guideline has evolved over two decades, with over 1150 consecutive patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis managed under the Darwin Prospective Melioidosis Study. The current guideline, published in 2015, has been associated with low rates of recrudescence, relapse and mortality, and together with the treatment trials in Thailand, forms the basis for consensus global guidelines. We aimed to reassess the Darwin guideline and determine if any adjustments to the recommendations better reflect current practice in melioidosis therapy at Royal Darwin Hospital. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This retrospective cohort study reviews the characteristics, admission duration, duration of intravenous antibiotics, recrudescence, recurrence and mortality in all patients presenting with first episode culture-confirmed melioidosis in the tropical north of Australia's Northern Territory from 1st October 2012 until 1st January 2017. 234 patients were available for analysis. 16 (6.8%) died during the intensive phase treatment and 6 (2.6%) did not have complete treatment at Royal Darwin Hospital, leaving 212 patients for analysis. Six (2.8%) patients had recrudescence during therapy and 10 (4.7%) had recurrent melioidosis (relapse or new infection) after completion of therapy. Persisting osteomyelitis requiring surgery was an important reason for recrudescence as was unrecognized osteomyelitis for relapse. For patients presenting with an antibiotic duration determining focus of pneumonia, durations of intravenous antibiotics were often prolonged beyond the current 2-week minimum treatment recommendation. Prolongation of therapy in pneumonia mostly occurred in patients presenting with multi-lobar disease or with concurrent blood culture positivity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 2015 Darwin melioidosis guideline is working well with low rates of recrudescence, relapse and mortality. Based on the practice of the treating clinicians, the 2020 revision of the guideline has been adjusted to include a duration of a minimum of 3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics for those with concurrent bacteraemia and pneumonia involving only a single lobe and those with bilateral and unilateral multi-lobar pneumonias who do not have bacteraemia. We also extend to a minimum of 4 weeks intravenous therapy for those with concurrent bacteraemia and bilateral or unilateral multi-lobar pneumonia."

By forming a chelated complex with ferric iron, cefiderocol is transported into the periplasmic space via bacterial iron transport systems and primarily binds to penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. This mode of action results in cefiderocol having greater in vitro activity against many Gram-negative bacilli than currently used carbapenems, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and cephalosporins. Thus, we investigated the in vitro activity of cefiderocol against a total of 246 clinical isolates of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Queensland, Australia. The collection was comprised primarily of bloodstream (56.1%), skin and soft tissue (16.3%) and respiratory isolates (15.9%). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of cefiderocol ranged from <=0.03 to 16 mg/L, where the MIC90 was 0.125 mg/L. Based upon CLSI clinical breakpoints for cefiderocol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, three isolates (1.2%) would be classified as non-susceptible (MIC >4 mg/L). Using EUCAST non-species specific (PK/PD) clinical breakpoints, or those set for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, four isolates (1.6%) would be resistant (MIC >2 mg/L). Further testing for co-resistance to meropenem, ceftazidime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline was performed on the four isolates with elevated cefiderocol MICs (>2 mg/L), all isolates exhibited resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, while three isolates also displayed resistance to at least one other antimicrobial. Cefiderocol was found to be highly active in vitro against B. pseudomallei primary clinical isolates. This compound shows great potential for the treatment of melioidosis in endemic countries and should be explored further."

He remembered wounding his foot three years ago in India with contamination by soil. Subsequently, recurrent pustulae appeared on his feet. One such pustule was found on admittance. The clinical examination showed low body weight, without further abnormalities. INVESTIGATIONS: The blood examinations revealed high inflammation parameters and ruled out any immunodeficiency. Smouldering infiltrates in the upper lobes were found on the chest radiography. Sputum was free of acid fast bacilli and no mycobacterial DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Bronchoscopy showed a normal endobronchal situation, Burkholderia pseudomallei were found to grow from specimens of bronchial mucus. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Under the empirical treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam, we could not find any response. After switching to Ceftazidime and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol (TMP/SMZ) we observed quick clinical improvement and normalisation of the inflammation parameters and notable radiological response over three weeks. We continued a five months TMP/SMZ therapy after discharge in order to prevent relapses.

The records of 57 consecutive nonimmunocompromised patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) between January 1989 and May 1993 with this diagnosis were reviewed. The microbiological data, chest radiographic changes and outcome were analysed. Nine (16%) of the 57 patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. When these patients were excluded from further analysis, a microbiological diagnosis was made in 41 (72%) cases. The most commonest pathogens were Burkholderia pseudomallei (n=10), Klebsiella spp. (n=5) and Staphylococcus aureus (n=5), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=4) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=2) were less common. This microbiological spectrum was quite different from that in the West, where the incidence of S. pneumoniae was higher. Also, when pulmonary tuberculosis was excluded, the mortality (67%) was much higher than that in other series. This was attributed to the high incidence of unrecognized B. pseudomallei infection, which is associated with a very high mortality in the region under study. In addition to applying published guidelines on severe community-acquired pneumonia, the endemicity of certain organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Burkholderia pseudomallei in different geographical regions needs to be considered when choosing initial empirical antimicrobial therapy."

In these patients, infection may be followed by a severe deterioration with bacteraemia, leading to death. Moreover, owing to the epidemic spread of some clones within cystic fibrosis communities, strict preventive guidelines have to be instituted. Early detection of Burkholderia cepacia colonisation is therefore essential, and requires the use of selective media. Identification by means of conventional procedures may be problematic, all the more as the previously named Burkholderia cepacia strains have been recently shown to constitute five genomovars (I to V), collectively designated the ""cepacia complex"", of which only three are classified as new species (II = Burkholderia multivorans; IV = Burkholderia stabilis; V = Burkholderia vietnamiensis). Moreover, closely related species, particularly Burkholderia gladioli, are also involved in cystic fibrosis. Many questions still need clarifications, regarding pathogenic mechanisms and propensity for the cystic fibrosis lung of these organisms.

All isolates were analyzed for genomovar status by recA gene polymorphism and subsequently random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting. Burkholderia cenocepacia is the predominant species recovered from the CF patients infected with Bcc at the Genoa CF Center. Of the other eight species comprising the Bcc, only a few isolates belonging to B. cepacia genomovar I, Burkholderia stabilis, and Burkholderia pyrrocinia were found. Of the four recA lineages of B. cenocepacia, most patients were infected by epidemic strains belonging to lineages IIIA and IIID, whereas only a few patients harbored IIIB strains.

In 1993, 12 patients were colonised with Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc): B. cenocepacia (n=6), B. multivorans (n=3), B. stabilis (n=3). Four patients were colonised with the same B. cenocepacia strain; two with the same B. stabilis strain. After 5 yrs, three B. cenocepacia- and one B. multivorans-colonised patients had died. In 1999, Bcc was isolated in 12 patients: B. multivorans (n=9), B. stabilis (n=1) and B. cenocepacia (n=2). Three patients were colonised by the same B. multivorans strain. Compared to matched controls, the 5 yr outcome was poor; four B. cepacia patients died and none of the control patients died. Lung-function evolution was poor. In conclusion, the rate of colonisation in Belgian cystic fibrosis patients is stable and low. Burkholderia cenocepacia was most prevalent in 1993; Burkholderia multivorans in 1999. The cross-infection rate is low. Three patients had transient colonisation.

The pulmonary deterioration in Bcc-colonised/ infected patients has a heterogeneous pattern leading, sometimes, to a fulminant development - the cepacia syndrome. To evaluate the relationship between colonisation/ infection by the different Bcc species and the clinical course, the authors carried out a retrospective study of 31 CF patients with Bcc bacteria isolations followed at Hospital de Santa Maria from January 1995 to March 2006. Patients were categorised into two groups: Group I, with intermittent isolations and Group II with chronic isolations. The prevalence of Bcc species was as follows: B. cepacia 57%, B. cenocepacia 43%, B. multivorans 7%, B. stabilis 13%. Three of the patients died of cepacia syndrome. The species B. cepacia and B. stabilis, usually less frequent in CF populations of Europe and America, were isolated in a considerable percentage of the patients examined. No correlation could be established between the species and the clinical outcome. Deteriorated but not stable patients from group II, whose lung function and pulmonary exacerbation caused hospitalisation could be retrospectively analysed, exhibited significant differences in the number of hospitalisations and pulmonary function (FEV1) in the year prior to and the years following Bcc isolation.

METHODS: A long term retrospective study was conducted of all patients with CF undergoing lung transplants from January 1990 to October 2006 in two French centres allowing transplantation in patients colonised with BCC. RESULTS: 22 of the 247 lung transplant patients with CF were infected with BCC (B. cenocepacia genomovar III (n = 8), B. multivorans genomovar II (n = 11), B. vietnamiensis genomovar V (n = 2) and B. stabilis genomovar IV (n = 1)). BCC colonisation was not associated with any significant excess mortality (HR 1.5, 95% CI 0.7 to 3.2; p = 0.58). However, early mortality rates tended to be higher in the BCC group than in the non-BCC group (3 month survival: 85% vs 95%, respectively; log rank p = 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly higher for the eight patients infected with B. cenocepacia than for the other 14 colonised patients (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.9; p = 0.04). None of the other risk factors tested-primary graft failure, late extubation, septicaemia-had a significant effect. The 5 year cumulative incidence rate of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome was not significantly higher in the BCC group than in the non-BCC group (38% vs 24%, respectively; p = 0.35). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that BCC infection with a non-genomovar III organism may not be associated with excess mortality after lung transplantation in patients with CF and should not be seen as sufficient reason to exclude lung transplantation. However, colonisation with B. cenocepacia remains potentially detrimental."

In the present study, we have compared the susceptibility patterns to 13 antimicrobials of 94 Bcc isolates obtained from 15 Portuguese CF patients in the course of chronic infection during a five-year survey. These isolates were previously genotyped and represent 11 different strains of the species B. cenocepacia (subgroups A and B), B. cepacia, B. multivorans, and B. stabilis. The results are consistent with the notion that CF Bcc isolates are resistant to the most clinically relevant antimicrobials and suggest an uneven distribution of resistance rates among the different species, with B. cenocepacia subgroup A isolates being the most resistant. Phenotypic variants exhibiting differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were obtained from the sputum samples of clinically deteriorated CF patients during chronic lung infection. The isolation of resistant variants coincided with periods of pulmonary exacerbation and antibiotics therapy."

Bcc bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment and are recognized as serious opportunistic pathogens that are virtually impossible to eradicate from the CF lung, posing a serious clinical threat. The epidemiological survey of Bcc bacteria involved in respiratory infections at the major Portuguese CF Treatment Center at Santa Maria Hospital, in Lisbon, has been carried out by our research group for the past 16 years, covering over 500 clinical isolates where B. cepacia and B. cenocepacia are the predominant species, with B. stabilis, B. contaminans, B. dolosa, and B. multivorans also represented. The systematic and longitudinal study of this CF population during such an extended period of time represents a unique case-study, comprehending 41 Bcc-infected patients (29 pediatric and 12 adult) of whom around 70% have been persistently colonized between 7 months and 9 years. During chronic infection, the CF airways represent an evolving ecosystem, with multiple phenotypic variants emerging from the clonal population and becoming established in the patients' airways as the result of genetic adaptation. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms involved is crucial for an improved therapeutic outcome of chronic infections in CF. This review focuses on our contribution to the understanding of these adaptive mechanisms based on extensive phenotypic, genotypic, and genome-wide expression approaches of selected Bcc clonal variants obtained during long-term colonization of the CF airways."

METHODS: The lung function and Brasfield and Shwachman score were assessed in 12 patients. BCC were identified and susceptibility was studied by MicroScan (Siemens). Species and genospecies of BCC were confirmed by molecular methods in a Reference Centre (Majadahonda). RESULTS: BCC were identified in 12 of 70 patients (17.1%) over a ten year period. The mean age to colonization by BCC was 24.4 years (SD: 7.71). B. cenocepacia was isolated in 4 patients (33.3%), B. contaminans was isolated in 3 patients (25%), both B. vietnamiensis and B. stabilis were isolated in 2 patients (16.7%), and B. cepacia, B. multivorans and B. late were isolated in one patient (8.3%). Among the B. cenocepacia, subtype IIIa was identified in two strains, and subtype IIIb was identified in the other two strains.

Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis can occur in healthy humans, yet binge alcohol intoxication is increasingly being recognized as a major risk factor. Although our previous studies demonstrated that binge alcohol exposure increased B. pseudomallei near-neighbor virulence in vivo and increased paracellular diffusion and intracellular invasion, no experimental studies have examined the extent to which bacterial and alcohol dosage play a role in disease progression. In addition, the temporal effects of a single binge alcohol dose prior to infection has not been examined in vivo. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we used B. thailandensis E264 a close genetic relative of B. pseudomallei, as useful BSL-2 model system. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were utilized in three distinct animal models to address the effects of 1) bacterial dosage, 2) alcohol dosage, and 3) the temporal effects, of a single binge alcohol episode. Alcohol was administered comparable to human binge drinking (&lt;= 4.4 g/kg) or PBS intraperitoneally before a non-lethal intranasal infection. Bacterial colonization of lung and spleen was increased in mice administered alcohol even after bacterial dose was decreased 10-fold. Lung and not spleen tissue were colonized even after alcohol dosage was decreased 20 times below the U.S legal limit. Temporally, a single binge alcohol episode affected lung bacterial colonization for more than 24 h after alcohol was no longer detected in the blood. Pulmonary and splenic cytokine expression (TNF-alpha, GM-CSF) remained suppressed, while IL-12/p40 increased in mice administered alcohol 6 or 24 h prior to infection. Increased lung and not intestinal bacterial invasion was observed in human and murine non-phagocytic epithelial cells exposed to 0.2% v/v alcohol in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the effects of a single binge alcohol episode are tissue specific. A single binge alcohol intoxication event increases bacterial colonization in mouse lung tissue even after very low BACs and decreases the dose required to colonize the lungs with less virulent B. thailandensis. Additionally, the temporal effects of binge alcohol alters lung and spleen cytokine expression for at least 24 h after alcohol is detected in the blood. Delayed recovery in lung and not spleen tissue may provide a means for B. pseudomallei and near-neighbors to successfully colonize lung tissue through increased intracellular invasion of non-phagocytic cells in patients with hazardous alcohol intake."

BCC isolates were identified to the species level by the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system and by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Sequencing of the recA gene in the 54 blood isolates revealed 37 (68.5%) isolates of B. cenocepacia, 9 (16.7%) of B. cepacia, 4 (7.4%) of B. multivorans and one isolate each of B. arboris, B. pseudomultivorans, B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis. The overall performance of the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system for correctly identifying the 54 BCC isolates to the species level was 79.6%, which was better than that (16.7%) by 16S RNA sequencing analysis. Bacteraemic pneumonia (n = 23, 42.6%) and catheter-related bacteraemia (n = 21, 38.9%) were the most common types of infection. Higher rates of ceftazidime and meropenem resistance were found in B. cepacia isolates (33.3% and 22.2%, respectively) than in isolates of B. cenocepacia (21.6% and 10.8%, respectively) and other species (12.5% and 12.5%, respectively). Overall, the 30-day mortality rate was 38.9% (21/54).

This study evaluated the frequency of chronic infection by Burkholderia, using microbiological and clinical data. Ninety-eight patients with CF attended from July 2011 to April 2014 in a Brazilian reference hospital were included. Antimicrobial activity, molecular epidemiology, Shwachman score, body mass index, exacerbations, and lung function were analyzed. Nine patients had chronic colonization, and all of them showed preserved pulmonary function levels, body mass index, and Shwachman score. Meropenem was the most effective antibiotic; however, divergent results were shown by other studies. Cross-contamination may have occurred in only two unrelated patients of different ages, who were colonized by B. vietnamiensis, which does not occur frequently. Twelve new sequence types (STs) were identified and three STs have presented intercontinental distribution. None of the patients presented known epidemic strains. In conclusion, a relatively low number of patients with chronic colonization and suspected cross-infection were identified. Different from other studies that have found CF patients chronically colonized with Burkholderia sp. having a greater deterioration of lung function, more frequent antibiotic therapy, and increased mortality, in the current study, the patients showed good clinical outcomes and favorable options for antibiotics therapy. This study also updated the epidemiological database, which facilitates the multicentric collaborative analysis and assists in the control of global infection by these pathogens."

Our objective was to determine the BCC prevalence and to evaluate its clinical impact on CF. Clinical and laboratory variables were determined for CF patients with BCC (Group-A = 50 patients) and without BCC (Group-B = 134 patients). The microorganisms were identified by biochemical tests, the Vitek2 Compact test, recA-PCR and recA-nested-PCR with species-specific primers and DNA sequencing. The patients were evaluated by the Shwachman-Kulczycki score (SKCS), Bhalla score (BS), spirometry and body mass index (BMI). The BCC prevalence was 22.5%. The most common species were Burkholderia multivorans (30%), Burkholderia cepacia (24%), Burkholderia cenocepacia IIIA (10%), B. cenocepacia IIIB (2%) and Burkholderia vietnamiensis (2%). There was difference between the groups in nutritional status (p = 0.02) and general activity (p = 0.026). There was difference in total BS points (p = 0.04) and the following parameters: bronchiectasis severity (p = 0.007), peribronchial thickening (p = 0.013), bronchiectasis extent (p = 0.01) and general aspects of the affected bronchial zone (p = 0.02). The respiratory disorder classifications were as follows: obstructive-4.8% (Group-A) and 23.8% (Group-B); restrictive-9.5% (Group-A and Group-B); obstructive + restrictive-19% (Group-A) and 1.6% (Group-B); and obstructive + restrictive with a decreased forced expiratory flow-47.6% (Group-A) and 30.2% (Group-B) (p = 0.02). Nutritional status was a minor contributing factor to weight, height and BMI in the Group-A (p = 0.02). The BCC prevalence, particularly the prevalence of B. multivorans, was higher in this study. The SKCS, BS, spirometry and nutritional status results showed that BCC has a negative impact on clinical status. Phenotypic methods are useful for the identification of presumptive BCC. The Vitek2 Compact test showed accuracy in BCC identification. PCR, nested-PCR, and recA sequencing showed specificity in BCC species identification."

Staphylococcus aureus and viridans streptococci remain the most common etiological agent. Cardiobacterium hominis, a member of the HACEK (Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species) group of fastidious gram-negative bacillus, is a part of normal upper respiratory flora and a rare cause implicated in IE. Cases of Cardiobacterium hominis endocarditis are being increasingly reported in last few years due to advancement in automated blood culture system such as BacT/ALERT Virtuo  and identification system such as MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry). We herein report a first case of Cardiobacterium hominis endocarditis in a pregnant woman at 20 weeks of gestation. Following spontaneous abortion and evacuation of the fetus, appropriate surgical intervention under heparinized condition and pathogen-directed medical intervention was initiated in this patient. This case report highlights the importance of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, which augments earlier resolution of the disease."

A case report.ABSTRACT:We report the second case of infection with Chromobacterium violaceum that occurred in Brazil. A farm worker living in the State of Sao Paulo presented fever and severe abdominal pain for four days. At hospitalization the patient was in a toxemic state and had a distended and painful abdomen. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral pneumonia and hypoechoic areas in the liver. The patient developed failure of multiple organs and died a few hours later. Blood culture led to isolation of C. violaceum resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporins and sensitive to chloramphenicol, tetracyclin, aminoglicosydes, and ciprofloxacin. Autopsy revealed pulmonary microabscesses and multiple abscesses in the liver. The major features of this case are generally observed in infections by C. violaceum: rapid clinical course, multiple visceral abscesses, and high mortality. Because of the antimicrobial resistance profile of this Gram-negative bacillus, for appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy it is important to consider chromobacteriosis in the differential diagnosis of severe community infections in Brazil."

Since Japan has a warm climate, C. violaceum has been scarcely isolated from clinical specimens. With global warming, however, the geographical distribution of C. violaceum infection is likely to change. We report two cases of C. violaceum nosocomial pneumonia that occurred at an intensive care center in Japan. C. violaceum was first detected from a patient in the same center as a pathogenic organism of pneumonia. Later, the organism was isolated from sputum and a ventilator circuit tube of another patient in the center. The two patients were admitted to the center in nearby beds for several days. All of the pathogens were confirmed to be C. violaceum by the nucleic acid sequence of the 16S rRNA gene and were proven to be genetically identical organisms by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Both patients were managed with well-humidified and heated oxygen using a venturi mask and ventilator to promote excretion of sputum. It was thought that the medical respiratory care devices that provide a humid and warm environment, an optimal condition for proliferation of C. violaceum, can contribute to C. violaceum infection in a hospital environment.

The precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. In the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. Thus, we performed fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with COPD, 16 with stable clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. Twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with COPD exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (&gt; 10(3) colony forming units.mL-1). The predominant bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococcus viridans and Chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). Although significant bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients."

Two cases occurred that could not be explained by cross-infection during the outbreak. Environmental screening recovered C. meningosepticum from sink taps. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal macrorestriction digests of patient and environmental isolates showed them to be representatives of a single strain. The outbreak was controlled after staff were required to use an alcoholic handrub after washing hands, and toiletting of babies was done with sterile water instead of tap-water.

Chryseobacterium indologenes (formerly Flavobacterium indologenes) are saprophytic Gram-negative rods widely distributed in damp environment. Many sites of infection were described in the literature. These infections are always severe sometimes associated to multiple organ failure. The evolution is usually favorable with antibiotic treatment. Bacteria characteristically grow as yellow-pigmented colonies. They are naturally resistant to many antimicrobial agents. They are usually susceptible to piperacillin(DCI) alone or combined with tazobactam(DCI), ceftazidime(DCI), cefepime(DCI), fluoroquinolones(DCI), rifampin(DCI) and cotrimoxazole(DCI), but the in vitro susceptibility to these antibiotics should be systematically tested. Nevertheless, the optimum antibiotic treatment for Chryseobacterium-related infections remains to be established. In the case we report, the diagnosis was made according to the results of bronchial sample bacterial culture.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 99 preserved isolates were determined. The incidence (per 100,000 admissions) of E. meningoseptica bacteremia increased from 7.5 in 1996 to 35.6 in 2006 (p = 0.006). Among them, 84% presented with fever, 86% had nosocomial infections, and 60% had acquired the infection in intensive care units (ICUs). The most common underlying diseases were malignancy (36%) and diabetes mellitus (25%). Seventy-eight percent of patients had primary bacteremia, followed by pneumonia (9%), soft tissue infection, and catheter-related bacteremia (6%). Forty-five patients (38%) had polymicrobial bacteremia. Overall, the 14-day mortality was 23.4%.

METHODS: With 215 C indologenes isolates between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011, at a medical center, we analyzed the relationship between the prevalence of C indologenes infections and total prescription of colistin and tigecycline, clinical manifestation, antibiotic susceptibility, and outcomes. RESULTS: Colistin and tigecycline were introduced into clinical use at this medical center since August 2006. The increasing numbers of patients with C indologenes pneumonia and bacteremia correlated to increased consumption of colistin (p = 0.018) or tigecycline (p = 0.049). Among patients with bacteremia and pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality rate was 63.6% and 35.2% (p = 0.015), respectively. Administration of appropriate antibiotics showed significant benefit in 14-day survival in patients with C indologenes bloodstream infection (p = 0.040). In bacteremic patients, old cardiovascular accident (p = 0.036) and cancer (p = 0.014) were the most common comorbidity. The most common co-infection pathogen in patients with C indologenes pneumonia was Acinetobacter baumannii (36/91, 39.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23/91, 25.3%), carbapenem-resistant A baumannii (22/91, 24.2%), and Klebseilla pneumoniae (13/91, 14.3%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 215 isolates showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent (susceptibility rate: 87.4%), followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (48.0%). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a trend of increasing prevalence of C indologenes infection after introduction of colistin and tigecycline usage. The bacteremia group had higher mortality rate than the pneumonia group. Increasing resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, and newer fluoroquinolone were noticed in our analysis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was a potential antimicrobial agent in vitro for C indologenes. To avoid collateral damage, we emphasize the importance of antibiotic stewardship program."

CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a 66-year-old critically ill trauma patient who developed VAP, which was caused by C indologenes. The patient was injured in a riding lawn mower accident that trapped him underwater in a pond. The patient required surgery for intra-abdominal injuries and was mechanically ventilated in the trauma intensive care unit. On hospital day 5, the patient developed signs and symptoms of VAP. A diagnosis of C indologenes VAP was confirmed based on a quantitative culture from a bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient's infection was successfully treated with moxifloxacin for 2 days followed by cefepime for 7 days. DISCUSSION: Formally known as Flavobacterium indologenes, C indologenes is a Gram-negative bacillus normally found in plants, soil, foodstuffs, and fresh and marine water sources. Recently, worldwide reports of C indologenes infections in humans have been increasing, though reports from the United States are still rare. Bacteremia and pneumonia are the most commonly reported infections, and most patients are immunocompromised. The current case differs from most previous reports because this patient was in the United States and did not have any traditional immunocompromised states (eg, transplant, cancer, HIV/AIDS, or corticosteroid use). CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates that C indologenes can cause VAP in a trauma ICU patient."

Antimicrobial susceptibility data on E. meningoseptica remain very limited, with no established breakpoints by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The organism is usually multidrug resistant to antibiotics usually prescribed for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections, a serious challenge to the patient and the treating clinicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was done in a tertiary care oncology and stem cell transplant center. Susceptibility testing and identification of E. meningoseptica was done using Vitek auto analyzer. Records of immunocompromised patients with E. meningoseptica bacteremia were analysed from January 2009 to March 2012. RESULTS: A total of 29 E. meningoseptica bacteremia cases were documented between 2009 and 2012. Eleven patients were immunocompromised. Three were post stem cell transplant and one was post cord blood transplant. The mean age of the patients was 48.4 years. Mean Charlson's comorbidity index was 5.7. Four had solid organ malignancies, five had hematological malignancies, and two had lymphoreticular malignancy. Eight patients had received chemotherapy. Mean Apache II score was 18. Mean Pitts score for bacteremia was 4.7. Two were neutropenic (one post SCT, one MDS post chemo) with a mean white blood cell (WBC) count of 450/mm(3) . Ten had a line at the time of bacteremia. Mean duration of the line prior to bacteremia was 8 days. Eight had line-related bacteremia. Three had pneumonia with secondary bacteremia. All received combination therapy with two or more antibiotics which included cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, or cefepime-tazobactam. All the isolates showed in vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin. Five patients died, but a multivariate analysis was not done to calculate the attributable mortality. CONCLUSION: In our study, central line was the commonest risk factor for E. meningosepticum bacteremia, although a multivariate analysis was not done. There has not been much of a change in the susceptibility pattern of these organisms over 3 years, with good susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam and cotrimoxazole. Even though uncommon, E. meningoseptica is an important pathogen, especially in immunocompromised hosts with indwelling devices."

Among 45 episodes of Elizabethkingia-like bacteremia, 21 were caused by Elizabethkingia, including 17 E. anophelis, three E. meningoseptica and one E. miricola; while 24 were caused by other diverse genera/species, as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 17 cases of E. anophelis bacteremia, 15 (88%) were clinically significant. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia (n = 5), followed by catheter-related bacteremia (n = 4), neonatal meningitis (n = 3), nosocomial bacteremia (n = 2) and neutropenic fever (n = 1). E. anophelis bacteremia was commonly associated with complications and carried 23.5% mortality. In contrast, of the 24 episodes of bacteremia due to non-Elizabethkingia species, 16 (67%) were clinically insignificant. Compared to non-Elizabethkingia bacteremia, Elizabethkingia bacteremia was associated with more clinically significant infections (P &lt; 0.01) and positive cultures from other sites (P &lt; 0.01), less polymicrobial bacteremia (P &lt; 0.01), and higher complication (P &lt; 0.05) and mortality (P &lt; 0.05) rates. Elizabethkingia bacteremia is predominantly caused by E. anophelis instead of E. meningoseptica. Elizabethkingia bacteremia, especially due to E. anophelis, carries significant morbidity and mortality, and should be considered clinically significant unless proven otherwise."

CASE PRESENTATION: A three-month-old female infant born at term by caesarean section with meningomyelocele and congenital diaphragmatic hernia had two surgeries for the repair of meningomyelocele and diaphragmatic hernia on her 3rd and 14th day, respectively. On the 3rd month of her life, she deteriorated clinically with fever, leukocytosis and increase of acute-phase reactants. Gas exchange condition became worse than it was before. Respiratory secretions, oxygen requirements and ventilator demand increased. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Bacteriological blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid culture test results were negative. C. indologenes was isolated from tracheobronchial secretion sample obtained by endotracheal aspiration. Although susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC:0.5 gr/L), levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam, the isolate was resistant to meropenem, imipenem and colistin. She was treated with ciprofloxacin successfully. Her fever resolved and gas exchange condition improved after 72 h of the treatment. The antibiotic treatment was given for a course of 14 days.

In this report we present the first case, to our knowledge, of simultaneous central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to Chryseobacterium gleum from India. Case presentation. A 62 years old man with a history of a road traffic accident 1 month previously was referred to our center for further management. He developed features of sepsis and aspiration pneumonia on day 3 of admission. Four blood cultures (two each from central and peripheral lines) and two tracheal aspirate cultures grew pure yellow colonies of bacteria. Both matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, (MALDI-TOF MS; bioMerieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France,) and BD Phoenix (BD Biosciences, Maryland, USA) identified the organism as C. gleum. However, BD Phoenix failed to provide MIC breakpoints. The isolates of C. gleum both from blood and tracheal aspirate showed identical susceptibility patterns: resistant to cephalosporins and carbapenems and susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, doxycycline, minocycline and vancomycin. Following levofloxacin therapy, the fever responded within 48 h and procalcitonin levels decreased without removal of the central line or endotracheal tube. However, the patient developed sudden cardiac arrest on day 10 of treatment and could not be resuscitated. Conclusion.

Most of them are identified as opportunistic, nosocomial pathogens in patients. Uncommon species are identified accurately, mainly due to the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical microbiology practice. Most of these uncommon non-fermenting rods are isolated from lower respiratory tract samples. Their significance in lower respiratory tract infections, such as rules of their testing are not clarified yet. AIM: The aim of this study was to review the clinical microbiological features of these bacteria, especially their roles in lower respiratory tract infections and antibiotic treatment options. METHOD: Lower respiratory tract samples of 3589 patients collected in a four-year period (2013-2016) were analyzed retrospectively at Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). Identification of bacteria was performed by MALDI-TOF MS, the antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was revealed to be the second, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii the third most common non-fermenting rod in lower respiratory tract samples, behind the most common Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total number of uncommon non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates was 742. Twenty-three percent of isolates were Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Beside Chryseobacterium, Rhizobium, Delftia, Elizabethkingia, Ralstonia and Ochrobactrum species, and few other uncommon species were identified among our isolates. The accurate identification of this species is obligatory, while most of them show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides. Resistance to ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems was frequently observed also. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found to be the most effective antibiotic agents. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(1): 23-30."

The organism was provisionally identified phenotypically, and identification was confirmed by the BD Phoenix automated microbiology system. Minimum inhibitory concentration values of antibiotic susceptibility were determined. Results: A total of 12 isolates of C. indologenes were recovered from 11 patients. Five patients had C. indologenes bloodstream infection (BSI), one had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and one had both BSI and VAP. In four others, the organism was isolated from the catheterized urinary tract. All VAP and BSI patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Units and mechanically ventilated; all had central lines and history of colistin therapy during the past 15 days. The common underlying risk factors were diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Conclusions: C. indologenes infections are increasing because of higher use of carbapenems and colistin, to which it is intrinsically resistant."

Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-lactose-fermenting, gram-negative, health care-associated pathogen (HCAP). It is ubiquitous and intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics. Despite its low virulence, C. indologenes has been widely reported to cause life-threatening infections. Patients on chronic immunosuppressant drugs, harboring invasive devices and indwelling catheters become the nidus for C. indologenes. Typically, C. indologenes causes major health care-associated infections such as pneumonia, empyema, pyelonephritis, cystitis, peritonitis, meningitis, and bacteremia in patients harboring central venous catheters. Management of C. indologenes infection in neonates is not adequately documented owing to underreporting, particularly in India. Because of its multidrug resistance and the scant availability of data from the literature, the effective empirical treatment of C. indologenes is challenging. We present an uncommon case of bacteremia caused by C. indologenes in a preterm newborn baby with moderate respiratory distress syndrome who was successfully treated. We also provide a review of infections in the neonatal age group. Henceforth, in neonates receiving treatments involving invasive equipment use and long-term antibiotic therapy, multidrug resistant C. indologenes should be considered an HCAP."

Amongst them are hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), two frequent fatal septicaemic entities amongst hospitalised patients. We reviewed the PubMed database to identify the common organisms implicated in HAP/VAP, to explore the respective risk factors, and to find the appropriate antibiotic choice. Apart from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp., MDR or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-Acinetobacter baumannii complex spp., followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Chryseobacterium indologenes, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica are ranked as the top Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) implicated in HAP/VAP. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae notably emerged as an important concern in HAP/VAP. The above-mentioned pathogens have respective risk factors involved in their acquisition. In the present XDR era, tigecycline, colistin, and ceftazidime-avibactam are antibiotics effective against the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and oxacillinase producers amongst the Enterobacteriaceae isolates implicated in HAP/VAP. Antibiotic combination regimens are recommended in the treatment of MDR/XDR-P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii complex isolates. Some special patient populations need prolonged courses (>7-day) and/or a combination regimen of antibiotic therapy. Implementation of an antibiotic stewardship policy and the measures recommended by the United States (US) Institute for Healthcare were shown to decrease the incidence rates of HAP/VAP substantially."

Despite starting broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient developed fever, leukocytosis, and additional desaturation episodes. The patient's respiratory culture grew numerous C. gleum and few Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. He also had a positive urine streptococcal pneumonia antigen. Broad-spectrum agents were discontinued after prolonged treatment due to a continued worsening clinical picture, and the patient was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cover C. gleum.

We report 15 positive cultures and 6 cases of infection among immunocompromised adults at our institution over a 10-year period and review the English-language literature on C. meningosepticum. Excluding the present series, there are 308 reports of positive cultures in the literature, of which 59% were determined to represent true infections. Sixty-five percent of those infected were younger than 3 months of age. Meningitis was the most common infectious syndrome among neonates, seen in 84% of cases and associated with a 57% mortality rate. Less commonly reported infections among infants included sepsis (13%) and pneumonia (3%). Pneumonia was the most frequent infection among the postneonatal group, accounting for 40% of cases, followed by sepsis (24%), meningitis (18%), endocarditis (3%), cellulitis (3%), abdominal infections (3%), eye infections (3%), and single case reports of sinusitis, bronchitis, and epididymitis. The 6 cases in our series were all adults, with a mean age of 58.7 years. Sites of C. meningosepticum infection were limited to the lungs, bloodstream, and biliary tree. Infection in our series was associated with prolonged hospitalization, prior exposure to multiple antibiotics, and host immunocompromise, particularly neutropenia. C. meningosepticum is resistant to multiple antibiotics, and disk dilution is notoriously unreliable for antibiotic sensitivity testing. Sensitivity testing on the 15 isolates from our institution revealed the most efficacious antibiotics to be minocycline (100% sensitive), rifampin (93%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67%), and ciprofloxacin (53%). In contrast to reports in the literature, the isolates in our series displayed widespread resistance to vancomycin (100% resistant or intermediately sensitive), erythromycin (100%), and clindamycin (86%). These findings have important implications for the clinician when choosing empiric antibiotic regimens for patients with risk factors for C. meningosepticum infection."

Chryseobacterium indologenes (formerly Flavobacterium indologenes) are saprophytic Gram-negative rods widely distributed in damp environment. Many sites of infection were described in the literature. These infections are always severe sometimes associated to multiple organ failure. The evolution is usually favorable with antibiotic treatment. Bacteria characteristically grow as yellow-pigmented colonies. They are naturally resistant to many antimicrobial agents. They are usually susceptible to piperacillin(DCI) alone or combined with tazobactam(DCI), ceftazidime(DCI), cefepime(DCI), fluoroquinolones(DCI), rifampin(DCI) and cotrimoxazole(DCI), but the in vitro susceptibility to these antibiotics should be systematically tested. Nevertheless, the optimum antibiotic treatment for Chryseobacterium-related infections remains to be established. In the case we report, the diagnosis was made according to the results of bronchial sample bacterial culture. This case report underlines the need for specific management of patients infected with this species."

Most infections have been detected in hospitalized patients with severe underlying diseases who had indwelling devices implanted. Infection caused by C. indologenes in a newborn has not been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by C. indologenes in a full-term Caucasian newborn baby boy with congenital heart disease who was successfully treated with piperacillin-tazobactam. CONCLUSION: C. indologenes should be considered as a potential pathogen in newborns in the presence of invasive equipment or treatment with long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics. Appropriate choice of effective antimicrobial agents for treatment is difficult because of the unpredictability and breadth of antimicrobial resistance of these organisms, which often involves resistance to many of the antibiotics chosen empirically for serious Gram-negative infections."

METHODS: With 215 C indologenes isolates between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011, at a medical center, we analyzed the relationship between the prevalence of C indologenes infections and total prescription of colistin and tigecycline, clinical manifestation, antibiotic susceptibility, and outcomes. RESULTS: Colistin and tigecycline were introduced into clinical use at this medical center since August 2006. The increasing numbers of patients with C indologenes pneumonia and bacteremia correlated to increased consumption of colistin (p = 0.018) or tigecycline (p = 0.049). Among patients with bacteremia and pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality rate was 63.6% and 35.2% (p = 0.015), respectively. Administration of appropriate antibiotics showed significant benefit in 14-day survival in patients with C indologenes bloodstream infection (p = 0.040). In bacteremic patients, old cardiovascular accident (p = 0.036) and cancer (p = 0.014) were the most common comorbidity. The most common co-infection pathogen in patients with C indologenes pneumonia was Acinetobacter baumannii (36/91, 39.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23/91, 25.3%), carbapenem-resistant A baumannii (22/91, 24.2%), and Klebseilla pneumoniae (13/91, 14.3%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 215 isolates showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent (susceptibility rate: 87.4%), followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (48.0%). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a trend of increasing prevalence of C indologenes infection after introduction of colistin and tigecycline usage. The bacteremia group had higher mortality rate than the pneumonia group. Increasing resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, and newer fluoroquinolone were noticed in our analysis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was a potential antimicrobial agent in vitro for C indologenes. To avoid collateral damage, we emphasize the importance of antibiotic stewardship program."

CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a 66-year-old critically ill trauma patient who developed VAP, which was caused by C indologenes. The patient was injured in a riding lawn mower accident that trapped him underwater in a pond. The patient required surgery for intra-abdominal injuries and was mechanically ventilated in the trauma intensive care unit. On hospital day 5, the patient developed signs and symptoms of VAP. A diagnosis of C indologenes VAP was confirmed based on a quantitative culture from a bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient's infection was successfully treated with moxifloxacin for 2 days followed by cefepime for 7 days. DISCUSSION: Formally known as Flavobacterium indologenes, C indologenes is a Gram-negative bacillus normally found in plants, soil, foodstuffs, and fresh and marine water sources. Recently, worldwide reports of C indologenes infections in humans have been increasing, though reports from the United States are still rare. Bacteremia and pneumonia are the most commonly reported infections, and most patients are immunocompromised. The current case differs from most previous reports because this patient was in the United States and did not have any traditional immunocompromised states (eg, transplant, cancer, HIV/AIDS, or corticosteroid use). CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates that C indologenes can cause VAP in a trauma ICU patient."

Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-lactose-fermenting, gram-negative, health care-associated pathogen (HCAP). It is ubiquitous and intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics. Despite its low virulence, C. indologenes has been widely reported to cause life-threatening infections. Patients on chronic immunosuppressant drugs, harboring invasive devices and indwelling catheters become the nidus for C. indologenes. Typically, C. indologenes causes major health care-associated infections such as pneumonia, empyema, pyelonephritis, cystitis, peritonitis, meningitis, and bacteremia in patients harboring central venous catheters. Management of C. indologenes infection in neonates is not adequately documented owing to underreporting, particularly in India. Because of its multidrug resistance and the scant availability of data from the literature, the effective empirical treatment of C. indologenes is challenging. We present an uncommon case of bacteremia caused by C. indologenes in a preterm newborn baby with moderate respiratory distress syndrome who was successfully treated. We also provide a review of infections in the neonatal age group.

We reviewed the PubMed database to identify the common organisms implicated in HAP/VAP, to explore the respective risk factors, and to find the appropriate antibiotic choice. Apart from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp., MDR or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-Acinetobacter baumannii complex spp., followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Chryseobacterium indologenes, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica are ranked as the top Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) implicated in HAP/VAP. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae notably emerged as an important concern in HAP/VAP. The above-mentioned pathogens have respective risk factors involved in their acquisition. In the present XDR era, tigecycline, colistin, and ceftazidime-avibactam are antibiotics effective against the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and oxacillinase producers amongst the Enterobacteriaceae isolates implicated in HAP/VAP. Antibiotic combination regimens are recommended in the treatment of MDR/XDR-P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii complex isolates. Some special patient populations need prolonged courses (>7-day) and/or a combination regimen of antibiotic therapy.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (&gt; or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p &lt;.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity."

","SPECIES:Citrobacter freundiiID:17540673TITLE:Efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms. However, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in VAP. Our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of ertapenem in the treatment of VAP caused by susceptible ESBL strains. METHODS: Ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of VAP beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative organisms. RESULTS: From June 2005 to June 2006, we enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an ICU and diagnosed with VAP due to Gram-negative ESBL strains. Causative organisms identified as ESBL producers susceptible to ertapenem were Klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Proteus mirabilis (2) and Citrobacter freundii (2). Clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. The drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Ertapenem appears to be suitable for ESBL VAP therapy. This pilot study suggests subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication."

Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from &lt; or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time."

METHOD: A total of 201 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 14 hospitals in 11 cities. The MICs of 14 antimicrobial drugs were detected using agar dilution method. Phenotypes of carbapenemase were screened using modified Hodge test and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) test. Drug resistance genes were screened using PCR method. The strains carrying carbapenem resistance genes were confirmed by conjugation test. Homology analysis was carried out using pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis (PFGE) method and the epidemiological correlation is analyzed based on the Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) method in order to study the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Fifty-three strains among 201 carbapenem-insensitive Enterobacteriaceae were detected positive carbapenem-resistant genes, among which included 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 6 Escherichia coli and 5 Enterobacter cloacae. Among the 53 strains, 43 were from Beijing, 6 strains from Hangzhou, 3 strains from Nanjing and one from Fuzhou. Resistance genes-harboring plasmids were successfully transferred from 28 of 53 strains to Escherichia coli EC600. The PFGE spectrum showed that 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae were classified into three types, 9 Citrobacter freundii classified into four types, 5 Enterobacter cloacae classified into four types, while 6 Escherichia coli were the same type. Based on the results of MLST test, 29 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing KPC-2 type carbapenemase were all ST11, while among the four Klebsiella pneumonia carrying IMP-4 carbapenem resistant gene, three strains were ST876, one was ST147. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem-resistant genes were detected only in hospitals from Beijing, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Fuzhou, and type KPC-2 was the most common, followed by IMP-4 and IMP-8. High homology of resistant strains could be related to horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes, which should cause great concern."

Methods: A retrospective study of a total of 106 microbiologically febrile episodes in hospitalized adult neutropenic cancer patients, who were admitted from May 2009 to May 2013, at King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Results: Among 106 microbiologically documented febrile neutropenic episodes, the majority of malignancies were solid tumors accounting for 53.8% (57/106) and hematological malignancies accounted for 46.23% (49/106). The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 19.81% (21/106) followed by acute myeloid leukemia 15.09% (16/106), then colorectal cancer 13.21% (14/106), pancreatic cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 5.66% (6/106) each, multiple myeloma 4.72% (5/106), gall bladder cancer 3.77% (4/106), and lung cancer 2.83% (3/106). A total of 138 bacterial isolates were identified. The overall prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was 65.94% (91/138) and for gram-positive bacteria was 34.06% (47/138). The most common bacterial isolation sites were blood 33.32% (46 isolates), urine 29.71% (41 isolates), wound 19.55% (27 isolates), body fluids 9.41% (13 isolates) and sputum 7.96% (11 isolates). The most predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli 30.43 (42/138), Klebsiella pneumonia 14.49% (20/138), Staphylococcus aureus 13.04% (18/138), Sptreptococcus spp. 7.25% (10/138), Pseudomonas spp. 7.25% (10/138), Enterococcus spp. 5.80% (8/138), Staphylococcus spp. 4.35% (6/138), Corynebacterium spp. 3.62% (5/138), Enterobacter spp. 3.62% (5/138), Acinobacter spp. 2.90% (4/138), Serratia marcescens 2.17% (3/138), Proteus mirabilis 1.45% (2). Aeromonas hydrophylia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Stenotropomonas multipholia contributed to 0.72% with one isolate each. For gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers (ESBLs) rates were 38% and 22.22% respectively. For Pseudomonas aerugenosa imipenem-cilastatin resistance rate was 18.84%. For gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was 28.62%. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) rate was 1.18%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent as a cause of infection in adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia at our institution, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia with high ESBLs rates being the most common pathogens. Blood stream infections followed by urinary tract infections were the most common sites of infection.

Rectal colonization with CPE is a risk factor for bacterial translocation leading to subsequent endogenous CPE infections. This prospective observational study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of rectal colonization of CPE, the carbapenemase genotypes, and to identify the independent risk factors for the acquisition of CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards in a university hospital in China. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 150 fecal samples from rectal swabs were consecutively obtained for inpatients from the intensive care unit (ICU) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) wards from November 2018 to May 2019, and screening test for CPE was conducted by using prepared in-house trypsin soybean broth (TSB) selective media and MacConkey agar. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method and carbapenemase genes were characterized by both the GeneXpert Carba-R and PCR for blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM and blaOXA. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to characterize the genetic relationships among the carbapenemase-producing K. Pneumonia (CPKP) isolates. In order to further investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of CPE colonization, a prospective case-control study was also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six suspected CPE strains, including 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1 Enterobacter Kobe, and 1 Raoultella ornithinolytica, were identified in 25 non-duplicated rectal swab samples from 25 patients, with a carriage rate of 16.67% (25/150). Through GeneXpert Carba-R and subsequent PCR and sequencing, all the suspected CPE isolates were identified to be positive for the carbapenemase genes, of which 17 were blaKPC-carriers, and another 9 were blaNDM-producers. MLST designated all the CPKP isolates to be ST11 clone. Multivariate analysis indicated that urinary system diseases, operation of bronchoscopy, and combined use of antibiotics were independent risk factors for acquiring CPE colonization in high-risk patients from the ICU and HSCT wards. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high prevalence of rectal CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards, and a predominant colonization of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae clone ST11. Stricter infection control measures are urgently needed to limit the dissemination of CPE strains, especially in patients who were afflicted by urinary system diseases, have underwent bronchoscopy, and were previously exposed to combined antibiotic use."

Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly."

Previously identified as an organism most likely to cause opportunistic infection in the immunocompromised host, Eikenella more recently has been implicated in a number of clinical infections in non-immunocompromised patients. We report a case of community-acquired pneumonia, caused by Eikenella, in a patient with diabetes mellitus and a past history of testicular cancer. A review of the literature was conducted in order to review other cases of pulmonary infection with Eikenella, in immunocompetent adults. The condition was diagnosed in 15 patients, occurring most often in men with a mean age of 50. Patients most often presented with fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain. Complications often involved parapneumonic effusion, empyema, and necrotic parenchymal disease. Mortality rates appear to be low. Eikenella is most often susceptible to ampicillin and has variable susceptibility to aminoglycosides. The addition of clindamycin in non-immunocompromised patients with Eikenella infection, co-infected with other pathogens, also appears to be useful. Surgical intervention plays an important role in the recovery of these patients."

On the basis of this review, the predisposing factors, clinical features, and principles of diagnosis and treatment of this infection are outlined. Although infection may occur at any age, it seems to occur most often in patients less than or equal to 14 or greater than or equal to 44 years of age. Adult patients commonly have some underlying medical illness, pleuropulmonary malignancy being the most common. Patients present with a variable combination of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Four radiographic patterns may be seen: pleural effusion, pneumonia, cavitation, or a combination of these. Ampicillin and penicillin G are effective therapeutic agents; although the susceptibility of E. corrodens to penicillin G has been accepted as the rule, it may not always prevail. The need for increased awareness of this organism as a cause of pleuropulmonary disease is stressed because it is resistant to clindamycin, an agent that is increasingly used to treat anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections."

A 65-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with rheumatic valve disease was submitted to surgical mitral valve repair in 1996. Physical examination did not reveal any murmurs; physical examination of the lungs and abdomen was normal. The patient was admitted to hospital with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and fever. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an approximately 8-mm filamentous image with chaotic motion in the ventricular face of the anterior mitral valve leaflet compatible with vegetation. Treatment with ceftriaxone and gentamicin was initiated. Haemophilus parainfluenzae grew in five blood culture samples. Along the hospital stay, the patient's level of consciousness decreased, and she was diagnosed with ischemic stroke of cardioembolic etiology. The patient developed septic shock refractory to the prescribed treatment and died 12 days after admission. Even though the patient started being treated for endocarditis before the infectious agent was identified, the prompt use of antimicrobials hindered the growth of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and made its isolation difficult."

We report a case of a large Eikenella corrodens liver abscess with simultaneously endocarditis in a previously healthy male. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Danish man was admitted because of one-month malaise, fever, cough and unintentional weight loss. On admission there was elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, as well as affected liver function tests. Initially pneumonia was suspected, but due to lack of improvement on pneumonia treatment, a PET-CT scan was performed, which showed a large multiloculated abscess in the liver. The abscess was drained using ultrasound guidance. Culture demonstrated Eikenella corrodens. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed aortic endocarditis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and abscess drainage, on which he slowly improved. He was discharged after 1.5 months of hospitalisation. On follow-up 2 months later, the patient was asymptomatic with normalized biochemistry and ultrasound showed complete regression of the abscess. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of documented Eikenella corrodens concurrent liver abscess and endocarditis. The case report highlights that Eikenella corrodens should be considered as a cause of liver abscess. Empirical treatment of pyogenic liver abscess will most often cover Eikenella corrodens, but the recommended treatment is a third generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolon. A multiloculated liver abscess may require drainage several times during treatment. The finding of Eikenella corrodens should elicit an echocardiography to diagnose endocarditis even in patients without clinical signs of endocarditis."

We herein describe the first case of septic shock due to a Gemella bergeri coinfection with Eikenella corrodens. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Asian man with a medical history of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease who was prescribed corticosteroids (prednisolone) presented to our hospital with dyspnea. On arrival, he was in shock, and a purpuric eruption was noted on both legs. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed fluid retention at the right maxillary sinus, left lung ground glass opacity, and bilateral lung irregular opacities without cavitation. Owing to suspected septic shock, fluid resuscitation and a high dose of vasopressors were started. In addition, meropenem, clindamycin, and vancomycin were administered. Repeat computed tomography confirmed left internal jugular and vertebral vein thrombosis. Following this, the patient was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome. Furthermore, he went into shock again on day 6 of hospitalization. Additional soft tissue infections were suspected; therefore, bilateral below the knee amputations were performed for source control. Cultures of the exudates from skin lesions and histopathological samples did not identify any pathogens, and histopathological findings showed arterial thrombosis; therefore it was concluded that the second time shock was associated with purpura fulminans. Following this, his general status improved. He was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation. The blood culture isolates were identified as Gemella bergeri and Eikenella corrodens. Gemella bergeri was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing later. The primary focus of the infection was thought to be in the right maxillary sinus, because the resolution of the fluid retention was confirmed by repeat computed tomography. CONCLUSIONS: Gemella bergeri can be the causative pathogen of septic shock. If this pathogen cannot be identified manually or through commercial phenotypic methods, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be considered."

It is mainly involved in head and neck infections, but it has also been identified as a cause of pleuropulmonary and intraabdominal infections. Its identification could be difficult due to its fastidious growth requirements, especially in the context of polymicrobial infection and is probably underreported. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective 5-year review of clinical charts and laboratory database. RESULTS: We describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics of 9 deep-seated infections caused by EC, diagnosed in locations different from the head and neck. CONCLUSION: EC deep-seated infections are often found in patients with comorbid conditions and a history of interventional procedures. Due to the characteristic torpid evolution of EC abscesses, imaging to assess the necessity of debridement and avoid early cessation of antibiotics is necessary."

METHODS: With 215 C indologenes isolates between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2011, at a medical center, we analyzed the relationship between the prevalence of C indologenes infections and total prescription of colistin and tigecycline, clinical manifestation, antibiotic susceptibility, and outcomes. RESULTS: Colistin and tigecycline were introduced into clinical use at this medical center since August 2006. The increasing numbers of patients with C indologenes pneumonia and bacteremia correlated to increased consumption of colistin (p = 0.018) or tigecycline (p = 0.049). Among patients with bacteremia and pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality rate was 63.6% and 35.2% (p = 0.015), respectively. Administration of appropriate antibiotics showed significant benefit in 14-day survival in patients with C indologenes bloodstream infection (p = 0.040). In bacteremic patients, old cardiovascular accident (p = 0.036) and cancer (p = 0.014) were the most common comorbidity. The most common co-infection pathogen in patients with C indologenes pneumonia was Acinetobacter baumannii (36/91, 39.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23/91, 25.3%), carbapenem-resistant A baumannii (22/91, 24.2%), and Klebseilla pneumoniae (13/91, 14.3%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 215 isolates showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent (susceptibility rate: 87.4%), followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (48.0%). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a trend of increasing prevalence of C indologenes infection after introduction of colistin and tigecycline usage. The bacteremia group had higher mortality rate than the pneumonia group. Increasing resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, and newer fluoroquinolone were noticed in our analysis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was a potential antimicrobial agent in vitro for C indologenes. To avoid collateral damage, we emphasize the importance of antibiotic stewardship program."

CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a 66-year-old critically ill trauma patient who developed VAP, which was caused by C indologenes. The patient was injured in a riding lawn mower accident that trapped him underwater in a pond. The patient required surgery for intra-abdominal injuries and was mechanically ventilated in the trauma intensive care unit. On hospital day 5, the patient developed signs and symptoms of VAP. A diagnosis of C indologenes VAP was confirmed based on a quantitative culture from a bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient's infection was successfully treated with moxifloxacin for 2 days followed by cefepime for 7 days. DISCUSSION: Formally known as Flavobacterium indologenes, C indologenes is a Gram-negative bacillus normally found in plants, soil, foodstuffs, and fresh and marine water sources. Recently, worldwide reports of C indologenes infections in humans have been increasing, though reports from the United States are still rare. Bacteremia and pneumonia are the most commonly reported infections, and most patients are immunocompromised. The current case differs from most previous reports because this patient was in the United States and did not have any traditional immunocompromised states (eg, transplant, cancer, HIV/AIDS, or corticosteroid use). CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates that C indologenes can cause VAP in a trauma ICU patient."

Antimicrobial susceptibility data on E. meningoseptica remain very limited, with no established breakpoints by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The organism is usually multidrug resistant to antibiotics usually prescribed for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections, a serious challenge to the patient and the treating clinicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was done in a tertiary care oncology and stem cell transplant center. Susceptibility testing and identification of E. meningoseptica was done using Vitek auto analyzer. Records of immunocompromised patients with E. meningoseptica bacteremia were analysed from January 2009 to March 2012. RESULTS: A total of 29 E. meningoseptica bacteremia cases were documented between 2009 and 2012. Eleven patients were immunocompromised. Three were post stem cell transplant and one was post cord blood transplant. The mean age of the patients was 48.4 years. Mean Charlson's comorbidity index was 5.7. Four had solid organ malignancies, five had hematological malignancies, and two had lymphoreticular malignancy. Eight patients had received chemotherapy. Mean Apache II score was 18. Mean Pitts score for bacteremia was 4.7. Two were neutropenic (one post SCT, one MDS post chemo) with a mean white blood cell (WBC) count of 450/mm(3) . Ten had a line at the time of bacteremia. Mean duration of the line prior to bacteremia was 8 days. Eight had line-related bacteremia. Three had pneumonia with secondary bacteremia. All received combination therapy with two or more antibiotics which included cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, or cefepime-tazobactam. All the isolates showed in vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin. Five patients died, but a multivariate analysis was not done to calculate the attributable mortality. CONCLUSION: In our study, central line was the commonest risk factor for E. meningosepticum bacteremia, although a multivariate analysis was not done. There has not been much of a change in the susceptibility pattern of these organisms over 3 years, with good susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam and cotrimoxazole. Even though uncommon, E. meningoseptica is an important pathogen, especially in immunocompromised hosts with indwelling devices."

CASE REPORT: At an outside hospital, a 78 year-old male presented with fevers and shortness of breath. He was empirically initiated on standard doses of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected pneumonia and sepsis. Blood and sputum cultures identified Elizabethkingia meningosepticum sensitive only to piperacillin-tazobactam by E-test susceptibility testing. After 10 days of empiric therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam dosed at 3.375 g IV every 8 h over 30 min, the patient transferred to our institution and was initiated on piperacillin-tazobactam at 3.375 g IV every 8 h administered as a 4 h infusion. The patient failed to improve; piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to 4.5 g IV over 4 h every 8 h and later changed to the hospital protocol dose of 3.375 g IV over 4 h every 6 h. The patient achieved negative blood cultures within 24 h of optimized dosing. DISCUSSION: We present the first case to our knowledge that describes failure to respond and subsequent response within a single patient where beta-lactam dosing was altered to optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK-PD). Our patient received non-standard dose-escalation for piperacillin-tazobactam. Drug exposure was estimated post-hoc utilizing robust mathematical simulations to describe alterations in disposition over time.

We determined the clinical and molecular epidemiology of bacteremia caused by Elizabethkingia-like species from five regional hospitals in Hong Kong. Among 45 episodes of Elizabethkingia-like bacteremia, 21 were caused by Elizabethkingia, including 17 E. anophelis, three E. meningoseptica and one E. miricola; while 24 were caused by other diverse genera/species, as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 17 cases of E. anophelis bacteremia, 15 (88%) were clinically significant. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia (n = 5), followed by catheter-related bacteremia (n = 4), neonatal meningitis (n = 3), nosocomial bacteremia (n = 2) and neutropenic fever (n = 1). E. anophelis bacteremia was commonly associated with complications and carried 23.5% mortality. In contrast, of the 24 episodes of bacteremia due to non-Elizabethkingia species, 16 (67%) were clinically insignificant. Compared to non-Elizabethkingia bacteremia, Elizabethkingia bacteremia was associated with more clinically significant infections (P &lt; 0.01) and positive cultures from other sites (P &lt; 0.01), less polymicrobial bacteremia (P &lt; 0.01), and higher complication (P &lt; 0.05) and mortality (P &lt; 0.05) rates. Elizabethkingia bacteremia is predominantly caused by E. anophelis instead of E. meningoseptica.

Species of the genus Chryseobacterium are emerging healthcare-associated pathogens, often colonizing the hospital environment. There are no clear guidelines available for antimicrobial susceptibility of this organism. In this report we present the first case, to our knowledge, of simultaneous central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to Chryseobacterium gleum from India. Case presentation. A 62 years old man with a history of a road traffic accident 1 month previously was referred to our center for further management. He developed features of sepsis and aspiration pneumonia on day 3 of admission. Four blood cultures (two each from central and peripheral lines) and two tracheal aspirate cultures grew pure yellow colonies of bacteria. Both matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, (MALDI-TOF MS; bioMerieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France,) and BD Phoenix (BD Biosciences, Maryland, USA) identified the organism as C. gleum. However, BD Phoenix failed to provide MIC breakpoints. The isolates of C. gleum both from blood and tracheal aspirate showed identical susceptibility patterns: resistant to cephalosporins and carbapenems and susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, doxycycline, minocycline and vancomycin. Following levofloxacin therapy, the fever responded within 48 h and procalcitonin levels decreased without removal of the central line or endotracheal tube. However, the patient developed sudden cardiac arrest on day 10 of treatment and could not be resuscitated. Conclusion. Rapid and accurate identification of C. gleum in the laboratory, preferably based on MALDI-TOF, is essential for guiding therapy. C. gleum responds well to fluoroquinolones without the need to remove indwelling catheters."

Most of them are identified as opportunistic, nosocomial pathogens in patients. Uncommon species are identified accurately, mainly due to the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical microbiology practice. Most of these uncommon non-fermenting rods are isolated from lower respiratory tract samples. Their significance in lower respiratory tract infections, such as rules of their testing are not clarified yet. AIM: The aim of this study was to review the clinical microbiological features of these bacteria, especially their roles in lower respiratory tract infections and antibiotic treatment options. METHOD: Lower respiratory tract samples of 3589 patients collected in a four-year period (2013-2016) were analyzed retrospectively at Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). Identification of bacteria was performed by MALDI-TOF MS, the antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was revealed to be the second, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii the third most common non-fermenting rod in lower respiratory tract samples, behind the most common Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total number of uncommon non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates was 742. Twenty-three percent of isolates were Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Beside Chryseobacterium, Rhizobium, Delftia, Elizabethkingia, Ralstonia and Ochrobactrum species, and few other uncommon species were identified among our isolates. The accurate identification of this species is obligatory, while most of them show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides. Resistance to ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems was frequently observed also. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found to be the most effective antibiotic agents. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(1): 23-30."

Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-lactose-fermenting, gram-negative, health care-associated pathogen (HCAP). It is ubiquitous and intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics. Despite its low virulence, C. indologenes has been widely reported to cause life-threatening infections. Patients on chronic immunosuppressant drugs, harboring invasive devices and indwelling catheters become the nidus for C. indologenes. Typically, C. indologenes causes major health care-associated infections such as pneumonia, empyema, pyelonephritis, cystitis, peritonitis, meningitis, and bacteremia in patients harboring central venous catheters. Management of C. indologenes infection in neonates is not adequately documented owing to underreporting, particularly in India. Because of its multidrug resistance and the scant availability of data from the literature, the effective empirical treatment of C. indologenes is challenging. We present an uncommon case of bacteremia caused by C. indologenes in a preterm newborn baby with moderate respiratory distress syndrome who was successfully treated. We also provide a review of infections in the neonatal age group. Henceforth, in neonates receiving treatments involving invasive equipment use and long-term antibiotic therapy, multidrug resistant C. indologenes should be considered an HCAP."

All patients with E. meningoseptica bacteraemia were retrospectively recruited at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between June 2013 and May 2019. Epidemiological data, clinical features and patient outcome, as well as antimicrobial susceptibilities of E. meningoseptica, were collected from patient electronic medical records. Twelve patients (eight male and four female) with E. meningoseptica bacteraemia were included in the study. Eleven patients acquired the infection from the hospital, five of whom were in the intensive care unit. All patients had one or more underlying medical conditions or interventions, including chronic illness (eight cases), major surgery (three cases), pulmonary fibrosis (one case), sickle-cell anaemia (one case) and end-stage renal disease (one patient on haemodialysis). Eleven patients had a prolonged stay in the hospital (>=3 months), and nine patients had received prolonged antibiotic therapy. Three patients had polymicrobial bacteraemia, including Serratia marcescens (two cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (one case). All E. meningoseptica isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and moxifloxacin but showed a high degree of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides and carbapenems. These findings have important implications for the clinician selecting optimal antimicrobial regimens for patients with risk factors for E. meningoseptica infection."

Amongst them are hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), two frequent fatal septicaemic entities amongst hospitalised patients. We reviewed the PubMed database to identify the common organisms implicated in HAP/VAP, to explore the respective risk factors, and to find the appropriate antibiotic choice. Apart from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp., MDR or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-Acinetobacter baumannii complex spp., followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Chryseobacterium indologenes, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica are ranked as the top Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) implicated in HAP/VAP. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae notably emerged as an important concern in HAP/VAP. The above-mentioned pathogens have respective risk factors involved in their acquisition. In the present XDR era, tigecycline, colistin, and ceftazidime-avibactam are antibiotics effective against the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and oxacillinase producers amongst the Enterobacteriaceae isolates implicated in HAP/VAP. Antibiotic combination regimens are recommended in the treatment of MDR/XDR-P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii complex isolates. Some special patient populations need prolonged courses (>7-day) and/or a combination regimen of antibiotic therapy. Implementation of an antibiotic stewardship policy and the measures recommended by the United States (US) Institute for Healthcare were shown to decrease the incidence rates of HAP/VAP substantially."

It produces a biofilm and has intrinsic resistance to a wide array of broad-spectrum agents. Risk factors include neonate or immunocompromised states, intensive care unit admission for more than 21 days, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, indwelling devices, and mechanical ventilation. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old cachectic man presented in the United States with community-acquired pneumonia and immediately decompensated, requiring ventilator support. Despite starting broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient developed fever, leukocytosis, and additional desaturation episodes. The patient's respiratory culture grew numerous C. gleum and few Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. He also had a positive urine streptococcal pneumonia antigen. Broad-spectrum agents were discontinued after prolonged treatment due to a continued worsening clinical picture, and the patient was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cover C. gleum. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with resolution of symptoms on post-discharge follow-up. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a documented case of a patient with C. gleum respiratory infection successfully treated solely with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The expedient identification of C. gleum is essential for proper treatment. The literature has consistently shown isolated respiratory C. gleum strains to be largely susceptible to fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia. All patients infected or colonized by Chryseobacterium /Elizabethkingia spp who were admitted between June 2013 and May 2019 were included. Data were extracted from patient electronic medical records. RESULTS: We enrolled 27 patients (13 males and 14 females) with a mean age of 35.6 years. Chryseobacterium/Elizabethkingia spp were isolated from blood cultures (n=13, 48%) and tracheal aspirations (n=11, 41%). The most frequent species isolated was Elizabethkingia meningoseptica (n=22). Although 6 patients were considered colonized, the remaining 21 patients presented with ventilator associated pneumonia (n=9), central line associated bloodstream infection (n=4), septic shock (n=4), or isolated bacteremia (n=4). In 25 cases the infections were health-care related. Three patients (11%) died within 28 days. Twenty-six isolates (96.5%) were resistant to carbapenems. Moxifloxacin and cotrimoxazole were the most active antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Chryseobacterium/Elizabethkingia spp infection is rare, but can be responsible for severe hospital acquired infections.

METHODS: Clinical isolates of Elizabethkingia spp., Chryseobacterium spp. and Flavobacterium spp. collected during 2002-18 (n = 210) in a nationwide surveillance programme in Taiwan were speciated by 16S rRNA sequencing. MICs were determined by broth microdilution. The broth microdilution results of 18 common antibiotics were compared with those obtained by the VITEK 2 automated system. RESULTS: Among the Elizabethkingia spp. identified (n = 108), Elizabethkingia anophelis was the most prevalent (n = 90), followed by Elizabethkingia meningoseptica (n = 7) and Elizabethkingia miricola cluster [E. miricola (n = 6), Elizabethkingia bruuniana (n = 3) and Elizabethkingia ursingii (n = 2)]. Most isolates were recovered from respiratory or blood specimens from hospitalized, elderly patients. PFGE showed two major and several minor E. anophelis clones. All isolates were resistant to nearly all the tested beta-lactams. Doxycycline, minocycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole inhibited >90% of Elizabethkingia spp. Rifampin inhibited E. meningoseptica (100%) and E. anophelis (81.1%). Fluoroquinolones and tigecycline were active against E. meningoseptica and E. miricola cluster isolates. Novel antibiotics, including imipenem/relebactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, cefepime/zidebactam, delafloxacin, eravacycline and omadacycline were ineffective but lascufloxacin inhibited half of Elizabethkingia spp. The very major discrepancy rates of VITEK 2 were >1.5% for ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and vancomycin. Major discrepancy rates were >3% for amikacin, tigecycline, piperacillin/tazobactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Report of 6 cases and literature review.ABSTRACT:Chryseobacterium meningosepticum is a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacillus historically associated with meningitis in premature neonates. We report 15 positive cultures and 6 cases of infection among immunocompromised adults at our institution over a 10-year period and review the English-language literature on C. meningosepticum. Excluding the present series, there are 308 reports of positive cultures in the literature, of which 59% were determined to represent true infections. Sixty-five percent of those infected were younger than 3 months of age. Meningitis was the most common infectious syndrome among neonates, seen in 84% of cases and associated with a 57% mortality rate. Less commonly reported infections among infants included sepsis (13%) and pneumonia (3%). Pneumonia was the most frequent infection among the postneonatal group, accounting for 40% of cases, followed by sepsis (24%), meningitis (18%), endocarditis (3%), cellulitis (3%), abdominal infections (3%), eye infections (3%), and single case reports of sinusitis, bronchitis, and epididymitis. The 6 cases in our series were all adults, with a mean age of 58.7 years. Sites of C. meningosepticum infection were limited to the lungs, bloodstream, and biliary tree. Infection in our series was associated with prolonged hospitalization, prior exposure to multiple antibiotics, and host immunocompromise, particularly neutropenia. C. meningosepticum is resistant to multiple antibiotics, and disk dilution is notoriously unreliable for antibiotic sensitivity testing. Sensitivity testing on the 15 isolates from our institution revealed the most efficacious antibiotics to be minocycline (100% sensitive), rifampin (93%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67%), and ciprofloxacin (53%). In contrast to reports in the literature, the isolates in our series displayed widespread resistance to vancomycin (100% resistant or intermediately sensitive), erythromycin (100%), and clindamycin (86%). These findings have important implications for the clinician when choosing empiric antibiotic regimens for patients with risk factors for C. meningosepticum infection."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using antibiotic susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis, transconjugation and Southern blot analysis, the cefoxitin resistance phenotype reflects the presence of a large plasmid [pYMG-1 (130 kb)] in Ent. aerogenes K9911729. One beta-lactamase with the pI of 8.0 from transconjugant of Ent. aerogenes K9911729 was identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. A 1475 bp DNA fragment containing the blaCMY-10 gene, identified on pYMG-1 of Ent. aerogenes K9911729, was sequenced and an open reading frame coding for 382 amino acid, CMY-10, was found. The 37 class C beta-lactamases were subclassified into 1a to 1j and CMY-10 into 1a by phylogenetic analysis. A sequence identical to the common regions in In6, In7 and a novel integron from pSAL-1 was found upstream from blaCMY-10 gene at nucleotide 1-71. CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly show that blaCMY-10 gene belongs to the group of ampC-related bla genes. Homology analysis among AmpC enzymes or ampC genes implied that integration of the chromosomal ampC gene into a large resident plasmid, followed by transconjugation, was involved in the evolution of blaCMY-10 gene. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The first identification of the blaCMY-10 gene is of concern as chromosomal beta-lactamases may cause serious therapeutic problems if their genes are translocated onto plasmids."

K-B paper disc method was employed for determination of the drug sensitivity of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: In the 207 strains obtained from the patients, the majority (68.51%) were Gram-negative and 30.91/ Gram-positive bacteria, with fungi detected in one case (0.48%). The major pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infection were, in the order of frequency, Staphylococcus aureus(14.49%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.49%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (6.76%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (6.28%). Drug sensitivity tests showed increased drug resistance of the bacteria, but Staphylococcus aureus still remained sensitive to vancomycin and most of the Gram-negative bacillus sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The major pathogenic bacteria causing pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and their drug resistance is obviously increased, suggesting the necessity of strengthening bacterial surveillance and more adequate clinical use of antibiotics."

The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia."

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to MBL-producing isolates were analyzed. METHODS: During a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an MBL-producing strain belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. We screened for MBL production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of bacteremia and 3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an MBL-producing isolate were studied. Most of the patients had previously been colonized with an MBL-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. The isolated pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to &gt;32 microg/mL) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. Tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. Molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(VIM-1) cluster in all isolates. Among the 12 K. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. Five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have failed. Twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. The attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the MIC of carbapenems. Colonization with an MBL-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. Both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria."

Unlike other fluoroquinolones used in our healthcare system, moxifloxacin's urinary excretion is low and thus we hypothesized that increased use of moxifloxacin is associated with an increase in fluoroquinolone resistance amongst gram negative uropathogens. METHODS: All antibiograms for Gram negative bacteria were obtained for 2000 to 2005. The defined daily dose (DDD) for each fluoroquinolone was computed according to World Health Organization criteria. To account for fluctuation in patient volume, DDD/1000 bed days was computed for each year of study. Association between DDD/1000 bed days for each fluoroquinolone and the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria to ciprofloxacin was assessed using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, r. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 48,261 antibiograms, 347,931 DDD of fluoroquinolones, and 1,943,338 bed days. Use of fluoroquinolones among inpatients decreased from 237.2 DDD/1000 bed days in 2000 to 115.2 DDD/1000 bed days in 2005. With the exception of Enterobacter aerogenes, moxifloxacin use was negatively correlated with sensitivity among all 13 Gram negative species evaluated (r = -0.07 to -0.97). When the sensitivities of all Gram negative organisms were aggregated, all fluoroquinolones except moxifloxacin were associated with increased sensitivity (r = 0.486 to 1.000) while moxifloxacin was associated with decreased sensitivity (r = -0.464). CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin, while indicated for empiric treatment of community acquired pneumonia, may have important negative influence on local antibiotic sensitivities amongst Gram negative organisms. This effect was not shared by other commonly used members of the fluoroquinolone class."

METHODOLOGY: Blood specimens received by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of Gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. RESULTS: During the seven-year period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of Gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. The eight most frequent species found were Acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (8%), Salmonella Typhi (7.5%), Escherichia coli (6.2%), Alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). At 80% susceptibility or greater, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime were active only on E. coli and S. Typhi. Cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except K. pneumonia while Amikacin showed activity against five species, A. faecalis, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and S. Typhi. Gentamycin was active against three species: E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and S. Typhi. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while Ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and S.

Appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as in vitro susceptibility of the causative pathogen and clinical response to the agent administered. In non-microbiologically documented infections, therapy was considered adequate in the case of favourable clinical response &lt;5 days. Patients had pneumonia (n=127; 66 ventilator-associated), intra-abdominal infection (n=23), and bloodstream infection (n=21). Predominant pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=29) Escherichia coli (n=26), Staphylococcus aureus (n=22), and Enterobacter aerogenes (n=21). In 49.6% of infections multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were involved, mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBSL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. Prior antibiotic exposure and hospitalisation in a general ward prior to ICU admission were risk factors for MDR. Empiric therapy was appropriate/adequate in 63.7% of cases. Empiric schemes were classified according to coverage of (i) ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (""meropenem-based""), (ii) non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (schemes with an antipseudomonal agent), and (iii) first-line agents not covering ESBL-Enterobacteriaceae nor non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. Meropenem-based schemes allowed for significantly higher rates of appropriate/adequate therapy (p&lt;0.001). This benefit remained when only patients without risk factors for MDR were considered (p=0.021). In 106 patients (61%) empiric therapy was modified: in 60 cases following initial inappropriate/inadequate therapy, in 46 patients in order to refine empiric therapy. In this study reflecting real-life practice, first-line use of meropenem provided significantly higher rates of the appropriate/adequate therapy, irrespective of presence of risk factors for MDR."

METHODS: The presence of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaPER genes was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis. Genetic similarity between strains was defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Enterobacter spp. was identified in 205 of 4907 of the patients who had positive blood cultures during hospitalization. Of those cases, 41 (20%) were ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. Nosocomial pneumonia was the main source of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. The presence of this microorganism was associated with longer hospital stays. The ESBL genes detected were: CTX-M-2 (23), CTX-M-59 (10), CTX-M-15 (1), SHV-12 (5), and PER-2 (2). While Enterobacter aerogenes strains showed mainly a clonal profile, Enterobacter cloacae strains were polyclonal. CONCLUSION: Although no difference in clinical outcomes was observed between patients with infections by ESBL-producing and non-ESBL-producing strains, the detection of ESBL in Enterobacter spp. resulted in the change of antimicrobials in 75% of cases, having important implications in the decision-making regarding adequate antimicrobial therapy."

METHODS: The clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from December 2005 to December 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from January 2009 to January 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (P &gt; 0.05) was observed. Gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. However, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (P &lt; 0.05). The risk factors of VAP include the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 5.680, 95% CI: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (OR = 2.219, 95% CI: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (OR = 2. 127, 95% CI: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.025, 95% CI: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.215-3.967). CONCLUSIONS: According to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria of VAP were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. The incidence of VAP was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia."

","SPECIES:Enterobacter aerogenesID:24115610TITLE:The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.ABSTRACT:Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC. "

Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients."

","SPECIES:Enterobacter aerogenesID:27765888TITLE:Neonatal Sepsis in Haiti.ABSTRACT:Infections (including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia and tetanus) stand as a major contributor to neonatal mortality in Haiti (22%). Infants acquire bacteria that cause neonatal sepsis directly from the mother's blood, skin or vaginal tract either before or during delivery. Nosocomial and environmental pathogens introduce further risk after delivery. The absence of cohesive medical systems and methods for collecting information limits the available data in countries such as Haiti. This study seeks to add more information on the burden of severe bacterial infections and their etiology in neonates of Haiti. Researchers conducted a secondary retrospective analysis of a de-identified database from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Nos Petit Freres et Soeurs-St. Damien Hospital (NPFS-SDH). Records from 1292 neonates admitted to the NICU at NPFS-SDH in Port-au-Prince Haiti from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. Sepsis accounted for 708 of 1292 (54.8%) of all admissions to the NICU. Infants admitted for sepsis had a mortality rate of 23% (163 of 708 infants admitted for sepsis). The most common organism cultured was Streptococcus agalactiae, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginusa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabillis Failure to order or obtain a culture was associated with an increased fatality (odds ratio 2.4) for infants with sepsis. Resistance should be a concern when treating empirically."

The aim of this study was to assess mortality-associated risk factors in patients with VAP by CRE and determine the outcome of several treatment options. METHODS: This was a retrospective study performed in two tertiary hospitals involving patients with VAP caused by CRE between January 2010 and August 2014. The outcomes were mortality within 30 days of VAP diagnosis and overall mortality during hospital admission. Risk factors for mortality were assessed by comparing variables of survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients with CRE-VAP were included, 73 (65%) male, median age 56 years. The 30-day mortality was 57.1% and the overall hospital mortality was 67%. In the binary logistic regression analysis, only age &gt;50 years was independently associated to increased mortality. Polymyxin was the most used drug (47.5%), followed by tigecycline (29.2%) and aminoglycosides (2.4%). Combined therapy with two active drugs was used by 17 patients (20.8%). No therapeutic option was independently associated to survival. However, combined therapy with two active drugs was superior to the therapy with a single active drug when inappropriate therapy was the comparator (p=0.044). The addition of carbapenem was not associated with increased survival. CONCLUSION: The best therapeutic option for VAP by CRE is still not completely defined, but the therapy with at least two active drugs was superior in this study."

Epidemiology, clinical profiles and outcomes.ABSTRACT:Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been steadily spreading worldwide during the last decade. Nine patients were identified prospectively and were followed during their hospitalization course to identify the epidemiology, clinical profiles and outcomes. These patients had one or more cultures positive for a CRE isolate, contributing to a total of eleven positive cultures from various sites without including duplicates of isolates obtained from the same site. Isolates from these patients included five Klebseilla pneumoniae, three Escherichia coli, and one Enterobacter aerogenes. Five isolates were grown from blood cultures, three from wound cultures, one from urine cultures, one from respiratory cultures and one from an abscess collection. Five survived the hospital course. The other five patients died due to severe sepsis, septic shock or multi-organ failure. Of the nine isolates of CRE identified for which molecular analysis were available, four K. pneumonia were confirmed as blaNDM and one as OXA-48. For the purpose of controlling the spread of CRE in our institution, we recommend considering active surveillance cultures and screening patients transferred from other hospitals or coming from highly endemic settings at admission for these organisms."

Near-drowning patients are exposed to aspiration that may result in pneumonia with life-threatening consequences. We designed this descriptive study to investigate the frequency, nature, and consequences of post-drowning pneumonia. One hundred and forty-four near-drowning patients (33 children and 111 adults) admitted during four years to the University Hospital of Martinique, French Indies, were included. Patients presented pre-hospital cardiac arrest (41%) and exhibited acute respiratory failure (54%), cardiovascular failure (27%), and lactic acidosis (75%) on admission. Empirical antibiotics, as decided by the physicians in charge, were administered in 85 patients (59%). Post-drowning early onset bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed as ""possible"" in 13 patients (9%) and ""confirmed"" in 22 patients (15%). Tracheal aspiration revealed the presence of polymorphous pharyngeal flora (59%) or one predominant bacteria species (41%) including Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophilia, and Morganella morgani. Despite adequate supportive care, drowning resulted in 45 fatalities (31%). Early onset bacterial aspiration pneumonia (either possible or confirmed) did not significantly influence the risk of death. In conclusion, near-drowning-related bacterial aspiration pneumonia seems rare and does not influence the mortality rate. There is still a need for practice standardization to improve diagnosis of post-drowning pneumonia and near-drowning patient management."

The clinical implication of such environmental GNBs is unknown. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review to determine how often such saprophytic GNBs cause human infections. Methods: We queried PubMed for articles published in English, Spanish, and French between January 2006 and July 2014 for 20 common environmental saprophytic GNB species, using search terms ""infections,"" ""human infections,"" ""hospital infection."" We analyzed 251 of 1,275 non-duplicate publications that satisfied our selection criteria. Saprophytes implicated in blood stream infection (BSI), urinary tract infection (UTI), skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), post-surgical infection (PSI), osteomyelitis (Osteo), and pneumonia (PNA) were quantitatively assessed. Results: Thirteen of the 20 queried GNB saprophytic species were implicated in 674 distinct infection episodes from 45 countries. The most common species included Enterobacter aerogenes, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas putida. Of these infections, 443 (66%) had BSI, 48 (7%) had SSTI, 36 (5%) had UTI, 28 (4%) had PSI, 21 (3%) had PNA, 16 (3%) had Osteo, and 82 (12%) had other infections. Nearly all infections occurred in subjects with comorbidities. Resistant strains harbored extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and metallo-beta-lactamase genes recognized in human pathogens. Conclusion: These observations show that saprophytic GNB organisms that harbor recognized drug-resistance genes cause a wide spectrum of infections, especially as opportunistic pathogens. Such GNB saprophytes may become increasingly more common in healthcare settings, as has already been observed with other environmental GNBs such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa."

The major causes of pneumonia in neurologic patients may differ from those in the general population, resulting in a different pathogen distribution. We investigated the trends of pathogen distribution in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients and the related antibiotic resistance in those with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: A retrospective study was performed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea. Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology with a positive respiratory specimen culture between 2007 and 2016 were included. Pneumonia events in patients were screened by chronologically associating the date of respiratory specimen acquisition for culture studies and the date of antibiotics administration. Subgroup analyses regarding multidrug resistance in HAP were performed in different pneumonia categories, by presence of &gt;=1 risk factor and by time period (first half vs. second half of study period). Microbial resistance profiles of isolates from patients with pneumonia were analyzed. Results: We identified 351 pneumonia cases in 227 patients involving 36 different pathogens. 232 cases were HAP, of which 70 cases were intensive care unit (ICU)-HAP. The leading pathogens were Stapylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, which were isolated in 133 (37.9%), 72 (20.5%), 55 (15.7%), 44 (12.5%), 33 (9.4%), and 27 (7.7%) cases, respectively. Cases with HAP showed a higher proportion of P. aeruginosa and a lower proportion of S. pneumoniae (both, p &lt; 0.05) than those with non-HAP. ICU-HAP isolates showed a higher multidrug resistance (MDR) rate than non-ICU-HAP isolates (p &lt; 0.005) in those with &gt;=1 MDR risk factor. Non-susceptibility to imipenem (p &lt; 0.0005), piperacillin-tazobactam (p &lt; 0.001), cefepime (p &lt; 0.005), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p &lt; 0.05) in Gram-negative pathogens increased over time in both ICU and non-ICU settings. Conclusions: S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, and E. aerogenes were the leading isolates in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients. Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative pathogens in neurologic patients with culture-positive HAP has recently increased."

Materials and Methods: A total of 120 unique CRE clinical isolates were collected and carbapenemase genes were detected using PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using standard broth microdilution method and the results were interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints. Results: The 120 carbapenem-resistant strains included 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Escherichia coli, 10 Enterobacter cloacae, five Klebsiella aerogenes, and three Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Seventy-four percent of these 120 CRE isolates were collected from patients located in non-ICUs; 65.0% of these CRE isolates were collected from male patients; and 34.2% of these isolates were isolated from respiratory tracts. Four different carbapenemase genes were identified among 103 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates, including bla KPC-2 (n=77), bla NDM-1 (n=16), bla NDM-5 (n=12) and bla IMP-4 (n=2). Overall, 21.7%, 37.5%, 40.8%, 75.0%, and 100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, CAZ/AVI, and ATM/AVI, respectively. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 96.7% isolates (n=116) were resistant to aztreonam, and the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) significantly reduced the MICs of those aztreonam-resistant isolates by more than 128-fold (range: <=0.125-4 mg/L), and 90.0% (n=108) of total 120 isolates were inhibited at ATM/AVI concentration <=1 mg/L. Conclusion: Our study revealed significant antimicrobial resistance among the CRE isolates against some commonly used antibiotics in three secondary Chinese hospitals. ATM/AVI exhibited potent activity against CRE isolates, including double carbapenemase-producing isolates, whereas CAZ/AVI was active against all KPC producers."

(2) The antimicrobial tests in vitro showed that these strains were multiresistant to antibiotics, but imipenem, amikacin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, cefoaperazone were sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The lower respiratory tract infections caused by E. cloacae showed no specific clinical manifestations. However, the mortality was high. The diagnosis should be made according to bacteriologic examination combined with clinical and X-ray manifestations. Combining antibiotics therapy was recommanded according to antimicrobial sensitivity test."

This study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with HAP. The mean age of patients was over 70 years. More than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. There was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score between the HAP-cefepime and HAP-ceftazidime group. The most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). In patients with HAP, P. aeruginosa (n = 13), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), Serratia marcescens (n = 6), K. pneumoniae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and Escherichia coli (n = 2) were isolated. The cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the CAP-cefepime group, the HAP-cefepime group, and the HAP-ceftazidime group, respectively. The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing CAP and HAP indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents."

We reviewed case records of patients who were diagnosed as having a recent Legionella infection on the basis of either the presence of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine or a 4-fold increase in L. pneumophila antibody level and with a blood culture that yielded a bacterium other than L. pneumophila. Three patients were diagnosed with legionellosis on the basis of the presence of antigen in urine, and 3 were diagnosed on the basis of a 4-fold increase in antibody titer. Of these 6 patients, 4 were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 with Streptococcus pyogenes, and 1 with Enterobacter cloacae. L. pneumophila infection in these patients may have predisposed them to concomitant bacteremia. Initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for patients who live in areas of endemicity and who are smokers should be treated with antimicrobial agents that have activity against pneumococcus and Legionella species."

METHODS: Sputum specimens were obtained from patients who developed pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit between January, 2001 and June, 2002 for bacterial culture and isolation. K-B paper disc method was employed for determination of the drug sensitivity of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: In the 207 strains obtained from the patients, the majority (68.51%) were Gram-negative and 30.91/ Gram-positive bacteria, with fungi detected in one case (0.48%). The major pathogenic bacteria for pulmonary infection were, in the order of frequency, Staphylococcus aureus(14.49%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.49%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (6.76%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (6.28%). Drug sensitivity tests showed increased drug resistance of the bacteria, but Staphylococcus aureus still remained sensitive to vancomycin and most of the Gram-negative bacillus sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The major pathogenic bacteria causing pulmonary infections in neurological intensive care unit are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and their drug resistance is obviously increased, suggesting the necessity of strengthening bacterial surveillance and more adequate clinical use of antibiotics."

No information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. Supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased Romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than 20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic DNA probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. Thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. Respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p&lt;0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. Hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p&lt;0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. Our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals."

The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia."

Ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms. However, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in VAP. Our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of ertapenem in the treatment of VAP caused by susceptible ESBL strains. METHODS: Ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of VAP beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative organisms. RESULTS: From June 2005 to June 2006, we enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an ICU and diagnosed with VAP due to Gram-negative ESBL strains. Causative organisms identified as ESBL producers susceptible to ertapenem were Klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Proteus mirabilis (2) and Citrobacter freundii (2). Clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. The drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Ertapenem appears to be suitable for ESBL VAP therapy. This pilot study suggests subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication."

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to MBL-producing isolates were analyzed. METHODS: During a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an MBL-producing strain belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. We screened for MBL production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of bacteremia and 3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an MBL-producing isolate were studied. Most of the patients had previously been colonized with an MBL-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. The isolated pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to &gt;32 microg/mL) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. Tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. Molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(VIM-1) cluster in all isolates. Among the 12 K. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. Five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have failed. Twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. The attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the MIC of carbapenems. Colonization with an MBL-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. Both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria."

The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology.

METHODS: In a group of 100 patients of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with identified pathogenic bacteria undergoing antibiotic treatment according to susceptibility test, the changes in the species of the pathogens and their ratio in their sputum specimens were studied, and the relationship were analyzed the characteristic between the changes and the age, the time of medication and the length of stay. RESULTS: Among all the bacterial isolates (n=295) in ICU, the percentage of Gram-negative bacillus was 62.4% (184/295). The prevalent causative microorganisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 22.4% (66/295), MRSA/MRSE 20.7% (61/295) and Acinetobacter spp. 10.5% (31/295). When one or more than one potent antibiotic in accord with the result of sensitivity test, change in ratio of pathogens occurred in 160, and change in species in 126. When the use of antibiotics was prolonged, the change in the former became less often. The change in ratio was less in 3-5 days than that of 6-7 days, the ratio was 72.7%, 62.5%, 60.0% (P&lt;0.01) respectively on the 3rd day, the 4th day and the 5th day, showing that susceptible pathogenic bacteria became less gradually, indicating that the treatment was effective . However, the change in species of pathogenic bacteria began more obvious, and it was more predominant on the 6th day and the 7th day, which was 66.0%, 77.1% (P&lt;0.01) respectively, showing emergence of new non-susceptible pathogenic bacteria. With increase in the use of different antibiotics, the species of pathogenic bacteria showed to increase an increasing tendency of change. When Gram-negative bacillus infection was treated, antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Candida albicans and MRSA usually appeared. But when Gram-positive bacillus infections were treated, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae readily appeared. There was relationship between the change in pathogenic bacteria and age, and the length of stay of the patients. The more older in age and the longer the length of stay, the change in pathogenic bacteria was more predominant. CONCLUSION: New antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria appears after seven-day antibiotic-targeted therapy in ICU. The change of species of pathogenic bacteria is related to the duration and type of using antibiotic, and also the age and length of stay. The longer time of use and the more different types of antibiotic used, the older in age and the longer in length of stay, the change in species of pathogenic bacteria is more predominant. Monitoring the dynamic change of pathogenic bacteria, adjusting the antibiotic promptly and rational use of antibiotics are very important to decrease the change in species and antibiotic resistance of the bacteria."

Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures.

METHODS: A selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the USA and 28 (12 countries) in Europe. Ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of MIC endpoints made by applying current CLSI (2010) and EUCAST (2010) breakpoint criteria. RESULTS: Against 1340 Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at &lt;=0.5 mg/L (MIC(50/90), &lt;=0.008/0.12 mg/L) and was 8-fold more active than ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 mg/L; only 79.2% coverage at EUCAST breakpoint). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; MIC(50/90), &lt;=0.008/0.015 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; MIC(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/L) were very susceptible to ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns. The potency of ceftaroline against three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint &lt;=2 mg/L) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains between the USA and Europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for E. coli). Ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant E. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at &lt;=2 mg/L) or K. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (USA and Europe) documented low MIC(50/90) values for S. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. More importantly, ceftaroline MIC(90) results for S. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/L), H. influenzae (0.015 mg/L) and M. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/L) were very low, all MICs being &lt;=0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline exhibited promising high potency and wide coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause CAP, especially isolates of MDR pneumococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in 18 patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. There was significant improvement in body temperature, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and chest X-ray score on day 3 of moxifloxacin treatment, which persisted until the completion of treatment (all p &lt; 0.05). Nine strains, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacter cloacae, were isolated from sputum cultures of nine patients. The isolated strains were eradicated by moxifloxacin. The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24 h) (AUC(0-24 h,ss))], maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), and trough plasma level (C(trough)) of moxifloxacin at steady state was 52.0 mug h/ml, 4.5, and 0.9 mug/ml, respectively. Mean AUC(0-24 h,ss)/mimimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and C(max)/MIC ratios for patients in whom MICs of moxifloxacin were determined for pathogenic bacteria were 723 and 62, respectively. The median AUC(0-24 h,ss)/MIC and C(max)/MIC ratios (based on Monte Carlo simulation employing MICs for 257 strains of S. pneumoniae collected during a respiratory infection survey by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007) were 209.56 and 17.88, respectively. Thus, when the target for the AUC/MIC ratio was set at &gt;=30 and that for the C(max)/MIC ratio at &gt;=5, the achievement rate for these two parameters was 97.36% and 96.71%, respectively.

Specific characteristics of E. cloacae pneumonia, however, have not been identified. DESIGN: Evaluation of clinical and microbiological records of patients with positive respiratory samples for E. cloacae was performed by a 1-year retrospective study in a large university hospital. RESULTS: Ninety-seven of 115 eligible patients with E. cloacae-positive respiratory samples developed pneumonia. Patients were predominantly male (68%), older (median age = 62 years), and immunodeficient (54%). Seventy-eight percent required ICU admission, of which 97% required mechanical ventilation. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurred in 58%. Those who developed E. cloacae VAP had undergone twice as many surgical procedures under translaryngeal intubation prior to VAP onset (89 vs. 48%, P &lt; 0.0001). Overall, E. cloacae VAP mortality was 24%. In E. cloacae VAP patients, presence of translaryngeal tubes (P = 0.02) and female gender (P = 0.0003) were associated with poor survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed male sex as a protective factor (relative risk: 0.39; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Enterobacter cloacae causes VAP with high mortality, predominantly in women. Risk factors for E. cloacae pneumonia seem to match those for VAP. The presence of translaryngeal endotracheal tubes seems to be the specific factor for E. cloacae VAP."

Ochroconis gallopavum is a neurotropic dematiaceous mold responsible for life-threatening respiratory and central nervous system infections in domestic poultry and in immunologically compromised humans. The world literature describes only 13 previous O gallopavum infections in solid organ transplant recipients. We report herein an O gallopavum phaeohyphomycosis with involvement of skin in a transplant recipient. A 69-year-old white man with a history of bilateral lung transplantation 6 years ago presented with acute onset of severe respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia. Lung function showed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Excision biopsy was performed because of a suspected pigmented basal cell carcinoma. Histopathology revealed dermal granulomatous dermatitis, focally suppurative, dominated by epitheloid cells with brownish round fungi. Further microbiological work-up of the biopsy specimen subsequently revealed O gallopavum as the causative organism. No brain involvement was observed. Antimycotic therapy with voriconazole 200 mg twice a day was immediately initiated and the patient was treated for 3 months. Additional intravenous therapy with tobramycin and imipenem was started upon detection of Enterobacter clocae and Enterococci in the sputum. The patient recovered during the next few weeks and was discharged on day 26."

METHODS: A retrospective study on neonatal pneumonia was performed. The study investigated antibiotic susceptibility of four common pathogens (339 strains) that caused neonatal pneumonia. Clinical characteristics of the newborns with pneumonia were analyzed. Of the 339 strains, 185 were isolated from bronchial secretions, 72 from blood samples, and 82 with positive results of both samples. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-four neonates with pneumonia presented positive results of bacterial culture. the most common pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (21.9%), Escherichia coli (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.0%) and Enterobacter cloacae (11.4%). The birth weight of newborns infected with Staphylococcus aureus was generally normal, and the time of hospital admission was later (after 24 hours of life). In contrast, the newborns with gram-negative bacterial infection, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, had lower birth weights and early time of hospital admission (within 24 hours of life). Nearly more than 50% gram-negative bacteria were resistant to second, third and forth generation cephaloporins. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are predominant pathogens of neonatal pneumonia. Neonatal pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria is common in newborns with low birth weight and its onset time is relatively earlier. Gram-negative bacteria that cause neonatal pneumonia are highly resistant to cephaloporins."

METHODS: A prospective surveillance covered 910 newborns. Case patients were defined as neonates with very low birth weight who had clinical signs of septicemia, pneumonia or necrotizing enterocolitis. Early-onset infection was defined as infection diagnosed within 3 days after delivery. RESULTS: The incidence of Enterobacteriaceae infections was 2.6/1000 patient-days. The risk of Enterobacteriaceae pneumonia increased with the length of hospitalization (P = 0.0356). The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (12.4% of all strains, in early-onset infection 18.5%) and Klebsiella spp. (9.1% of all). The ESBL phenotype was found in 37% of isolates, of which 89.3% were producing CTX-M-type, 70.2% TEM-type and 8.5% SHV-type. Epidemic clones were detected in the 2 studied neonatal intensive care units: 6 of the 9 ESBL-positive Enterobacter cloacae and 16 of the 18 ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were classified into 1 epidemic clone, which showed resistance to penicillin without inhibitors, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aztreoname, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae bacilli are a significant problem in neonatal intensive care units, especially in early-onset infection and for long hospitalized very low birth weight infants. The observed high drug resistance was in large part related to the dominance of epidemic strains as a result of horizontal transmission. The best way to reduce drug resistance would be adequate procedures of isolation and hand hygiene."

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with this type of infection in an effort to gain an improved understanding of the current clinical presentation, management and outcome. METHODS: Between May 2007 and May 2010, all patients, over the age of 18 years, suffering from GNB HVO were identified and their microbiological diagnoses were evaluated. RESULTS: This study identified seventy-nine patients with haematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO). Of these seventy-nine patients, 10 patients (12.66%) had Gram-negative organisms isolated. These organisms included Escherichia coli (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), Haemophilus influenza (1) and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Eight patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and/or surgery. Of the eight patients whose HVO was cured, five had Ciprofloxacin as part of their definitive antibiotic regime. CONCLUSION: The treatment of GNB HVO is often challenging because of unpredictable resistance patterns and limited published data on effective treatment regimens. Our study has highlighted the need for prompt microbiological sampling and initiation of early appropriate antibiotic regime. The most effective treatment for GNB HVO was with oral Ciprofloxacin over a period of 6-8 weeks."

METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy."

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of inpatients with bacteremia caused by ESBL and non ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. in a tertiary hospital over the period 2004-2008. METHODS: The presence of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaPER genes was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis. Genetic similarity between strains was defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Enterobacter spp. was identified in 205 of 4907 of the patients who had positive blood cultures during hospitalization. Of those cases, 41 (20%) were ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. Nosocomial pneumonia was the main source of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. The presence of this microorganism was associated with longer hospital stays. The ESBL genes detected were: CTX-M-2 (23), CTX-M-59 (10), CTX-M-15 (1), SHV-12 (5), and PER-2 (2). While Enterobacter aerogenes strains showed mainly a clonal profile, Enterobacter cloacae strains were polyclonal. CONCLUSION: Although no difference in clinical outcomes was observed between patients with infections by ESBL-producing and non-ESBL-producing strains, the detection of ESBL in Enterobacter spp. resulted in the change of antimicrobials in 75% of cases, having important implications in the decision-making regarding adequate antimicrobial therapy."

Thus, 66% of the patients proved diagnostically diagnosable by FB, so that appropriate therapy could be instituted. It proved possible to diagnose 77% of the PCP cases by TBB, and 62% by BAL. Thus, the combined use of both procedures increases the sensitivity of FB in detecting PCP. In two patients with PCP, no pulmonary infiltrations were to be seen. In no case was FB associated with any complications that required treatment. Through the additional use of other diagnostic procedures for identifying the organism, it proved possible to establish a total of 46 individual diagnoses.

RESULTS: The incidence of VAP in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (P &gt; 0.05) was observed. Gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. However, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (P &lt; 0.05). The risk factors of VAP include the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 5.680, 95% CI: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (OR = 2.219, 95% CI: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (OR = 2. 127, 95% CI: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.025, 95% CI: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.215-3.967). CONCLUSIONS: According to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria of VAP were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics.

This study was conducted to determine the risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as community-onset UTIs caused by Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary-care teaching hospital from December 2010 to January 2012 were included. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were excluded. We identified plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. RESULTS: Among the 323 non-ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset UTIs, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for AmpC. Escherichia coli was the most common AmpC-producing organism (60%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). The independent risk factors for acquisition of AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae included prior history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (OR) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (OR = 4.049; 95% CI = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (OR = 9.683; 95% CI = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). AmpC-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. Carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. The most commonly identified plasmid-mediated AmpC gene was bla(CIT), followed by bla(DHA)/bla(EBC), and bla(MOx). CONCLUSION: For community-onset UTIs, AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. To treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered."

Phenotypes of carbapenemase were screened using modified Hodge test and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) test. Drug resistance genes were screened using PCR method. The strains carrying carbapenem resistance genes were confirmed by conjugation test. Homology analysis was carried out using pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis (PFGE) method and the epidemiological correlation is analyzed based on the Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) method in order to study the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Fifty-three strains among 201 carbapenem-insensitive Enterobacteriaceae were detected positive carbapenem-resistant genes, among which included 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 6 Escherichia coli and 5 Enterobacter cloacae. Among the 53 strains, 43 were from Beijing, 6 strains from Hangzhou, 3 strains from Nanjing and one from Fuzhou. Resistance genes-harboring plasmids were successfully transferred from 28 of 53 strains to Escherichia coli EC600. The PFGE spectrum showed that 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae were classified into three types, 9 Citrobacter freundii classified into four types, 5 Enterobacter cloacae classified into four types, while 6 Escherichia coli were the same type. Based on the results of MLST test, 29 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing KPC-2 type carbapenemase were all ST11, while among the four Klebsiella pneumonia carrying IMP-4 carbapenem resistant gene, three strains were ST876, one was ST147. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem-resistant genes were detected only in hospitals from Beijing, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Fuzhou, and type KPC-2 was the most common, followed by IMP-4 and IMP-8. High homology of resistant strains could be related to horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes, which should cause great concern."

Postoperative pneumonia is the most common infection after lung transplantation (40%). Imipenem is frequently used for empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive care unit. Nevertheless, few data are available on the impact of ECMO on pharmacokinetics, and no data on imipenem dosing during ECMO. Currently, no guidelines exist for antibiotic dosing during ECMO support. We report the cases of 2 patients supported with venovenous ECMO for refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome following single lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis, treated empirically with 1 g of imipenem intravenously every 6 h. Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from the respiratory sample of Patient 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the respiratory sample of Patient 2. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the 2 isolated strains were 0.125 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Both patients were still alive on day 28. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of imipenem concentrations in lung transplantation patients supported with ECMO. This study confirms high variability in imipenem trough concentrations in patients on ECMO and with preserved renal function. An elevated dosing regimen (4 g/24 h) is more likely to optimize drug exposure, and therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended, where available. Population pharmacokinetic studies are indicated to develop evidence-based dosing guidelines for ECMO patients. "

While 1 week treatment has been reported as possibly sufficient, patients generally receive antibiotic therapy for 10 to 14 days. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether length of treatment in patients with VAP can be reduced with an individualized therapeutic strategy. The study was performed prospectively with patients diagnosed with VAP in our hospital's intensive care units between 1 January and 31 December 2015. Duration of antibiotic therapy was determined with 5 day clinical evaluation according to previously established criteria. Patients were divided into two groups depending on length of treatment, short (7-10 days) and long treatment (&gt;10 days). Nineteen patients received 7 to 10 day antibiotic therapy, and 30 received &gt;10 day antibiotic therapy. Demographic and clinical characteristics, Glasgow Coma Scale score, CPIS and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the time of diagnosis of VAP were statistically similar between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). A second VAP attack occurred post-treatment in three patients receiving short-term treatment and in four receiving long-term treatment (P=0.561). The numbers of antibiotic-free days were 15.6+-6.2 in the short-term treatment group and 8.3+-7.5 in the long-term group (P&lt;0.0001). One of the patients receiving short-term treatment died within 28 days after treatment, and four of the patients receiving long-term treatment (P=0.348) did so. The most commonly observed micro-organisms in both groups were Acinetobacterbaumannii and Pseudomonasaeruginosa. Short-term treatment can be administered in cases with early clinical and laboratory response started on VAP treatment by considering individual characteristics and monitoring fever, CPIS, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin values."

Moreover, preoperative treatments such as chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (which have recently been applied worldwide) might affect the bacterial flora of the sputum. To investigate the association among preoperative treatments, the bacterial flora of sputum, and the clinical and pathological features in resected esophageal cancer patients, this study newly investigates the effect of preoperative treatments on the bacterial flora of sputum. We investigated the association among preoperative treatments, the bacterial flora of sputum, and clinical and pathological features in 163 resected esophageal cancer patients within a single institution. Pathogenic bacteria such as Candida (14.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (6.1%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (4.9%), Klebisiella pneumoniae (3.7%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), Escherichia coli (1.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%), and Haemophilus influenzae (1.2%) were found in the sputum. The pathogen detection rate in the present study was 34.3% (56/163). In patients with preoperative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, the indigenous Neisseria and Streptococcus species were significantly decreased (P= 0.04 and P= 0.04). However, the detection rates of pathogenic bacteria were not associated with preoperative treatments (all P&gt; 0.07). There was not a significant difference of hospital stay between the sputum-monitored patients and unmonitored patients (35.5 vs. 49.9 days; P= 0.08). Patients undergoing preoperative treatments exhibited a significant decrease of indigenous bacteria, indicating that the treatment altered the bacterial flora of their sputum. This finding needs to be confirmed in large-scale independent studies or well-designed multicenter studies."

About 50% of colonization occurred before cefazolin prophylaxis and was present on admission to the intensive care unit. Typing of strains showed that horizontal transmission accounted for at most 14% of carriage. Cefazolin prophylaxis (and high gastric pH) were associated with increased levels of postoperative colonization, most notably for enterobacter. About 25% of colonization with enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia was followed by clinical infection. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common pathogen and pneumonia the most common infection. Infections contributed to eight of 11 deaths; four of the eight involved enterobacter. Potential control measures include eliminating endogenous Gram-negative flora by gut decontamination or at least stemming the increase in level of colonization that occurred after surgery."

Near-drowning patients are exposed to aspiration that may result in pneumonia with life-threatening consequences. We designed this descriptive study to investigate the frequency, nature, and consequences of post-drowning pneumonia. One hundred and forty-four near-drowning patients (33 children and 111 adults) admitted during four years to the University Hospital of Martinique, French Indies, were included. Patients presented pre-hospital cardiac arrest (41%) and exhibited acute respiratory failure (54%), cardiovascular failure (27%), and lactic acidosis (75%) on admission. Empirical antibiotics, as decided by the physicians in charge, were administered in 85 patients (59%). Post-drowning early onset bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed as ""possible"" in 13 patients (9%) and ""confirmed"" in 22 patients (15%). Tracheal aspiration revealed the presence of polymorphous pharyngeal flora (59%) or one predominant bacteria species (41%) including Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophilia, and Morganella morgani. Despite adequate supportive care, drowning resulted in 45 fatalities (31%). Early onset bacterial aspiration pneumonia (either possible or confirmed) did not significantly influence the risk of death. In conclusion, near-drowning-related bacterial aspiration pneumonia seems rare and does not influence the mortality rate. There is still a need for practice standardization to improve diagnosis of post-drowning pneumonia and near-drowning patient management."

Methods: This was a prevalence survey. From January 1 through December 31, 2016, the isolates were collected from 10 tertiary children hospitals in China. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by routine laboratory methods. The penicillin susceptibility of streptococcus pneumonia and Meropenem susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria were detected by E-test and disk diffusion method respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted according to the criteria of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guideline 2016. The data of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates from either the different patients (neonatal group and non-neonatal group) or various sources were analyzed by WHONET 5.6 software. Results: A total of 56 241 isolates were collected, of which 41.5% (23 328 isolates) were gram-positive organisms and 58.5% (32 886 isolates) gram-negative organisms. The five leading pathogens were Escherichia coli (7 995/56 214, 14.2%), Straphylococcus aureus (6 468/56 214, 11.5%), Streptococcus pneumonia (6 225/56 214, 11.1%), Haemophilus influenza (5 435/56 214, 9.7%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (4 523/56 214, 8.0%).

We sought to investigate the effects of viral-bacterial codetection on pneumonia severity and recurrent wheezing. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on neonates admitted to our hospital with pneumonia from 2009 to 2015. Of 606 total cases, 341 were diagnosed with RSV only, and 265 were diagnosed with both RSV and a potential bacterial pathogen. The leading four species of bacteria codetected with RSV were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae. Neonates with RSV and a potential bacterial pathogen were significantly more likely to have worse symptoms, higher C-reactive protein values and more abnormal chest x-ray manifestations with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (P &lt; 0.01). On Cox regression analysis, an increased risk of recurrent wheezing was found for neonates positive for RSV-Staphylococcus aureus and RSV-Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our findings indicate that the combination of bacteria and RSV in the neonatal airway is associated with more serious clinical characteristics. The presence of RSV and Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae may provide predictive markers for wheeze."

We performed a retrospective analysis of prevalence and treatment for CRE infections patients. METHODS: This study was conducted in three tertiary care hospitals from January 1, 2010 to December 30, 2016. Baseline data, treatment, and outcomes were collected in patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), bacteremia, complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI)/acute pyelonephritis (AP), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), superficial wound infection (SWI), biliary tract infection (BTI), deep wound infection (DWI) and sterile body fluids infection (SBFI) due to CRE. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four cases of CRE infection were identified: 31 VABP, 22 bacteremia, 18 cUTI/AP, 16 HABP, 16 SWI, 9 BTI, 7 DWI and 5 SBFI. The patient population had significant immunocompromised (33 of 124, 26.6%) and severe sepsis (43 of 124, 34.7%). The most common CRE pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (84 of 124, 67.7%) and Enterobacter cloacae (24 of 124, 19.4%). And the production of IMP-type carbapenemase was the main antibiotic resistance mechanism. The majority of patients to take monotherapy for empiric therapy and dual therapy for direct treatment. Outcomes were universally poor (28-day mortality was 22.6%, 28 of 124) across all sites of infection. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a large number of cases of CRE infection in 7 years from different parts, most of these pathogens have been confirmed to produce IMP-type carbapenemases. The retrospective analysis of cases of such bacterial infections will help to control future infections of these pathogens. Despite the high mortality rate, we still found that the selection of quinolone antibiotics can be effective in the treatment of CRE producing IMP type enzymes."

Empirical antimicrobial therapy with ceftazidime and vancomycin was initiated, and imipenem replaced ceftazidime 2 days later due to the patients pulmonary condition failed to improve. However, within 5 days, pulmonary consolidation rapidly progressed to necrotizing pneumonia complicated by lung abscess, empyema, pyopneumothorax, and tension pneumothorax, leading to the patient's death. After the patient had died, all bacterial isolates from cultures of pleural effusion, blood, and tracheal aspirate were identified as Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae), which was susceptible to imipenem but resistant to ceftazidime. E. cloacae should be considered in the differential diagnosis of complicated necrotizing pneumonia with lung abscess, empyema, pyopneumothorax, and tension pneumothorax. Carbapenem therapy should be immediately initiated until the pathogen in such rapidly progressive ICU-acquired pneumonia is confirmed.

Methods: This study included 293 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. We compared the pathological bacteria that were detected in bacteriological cultures of sputum, mouthwash and gastric fluid on the second postoperative day with the pathogenic bacteria responsible for postoperative pneumonia. Results: Postoperative pneumonia occurred in 26 (8.8%) of the 293 patients. Enterobacter cloacae was detected most frequently in the perioperative bacteriological culture, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Detection of each pathogenic bacterium in the perioperative bacteriological culture was not associated with the occurrence of pneumonia, excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As the pathogens responsible for postoperative pneumonia, 32 bacteria were detected in 26 patients with postoperative pneumonia. Detection rate of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for postoperative pneumonia in a perioperative bacteriological culture was 43.8% in a sputum culture, 40.6% in a mouthwash culture and 65.6% in a gastric fluid culture. The detection rate of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for pneumonia was up to 78.1% in the combination of sputum and gastric fluid culture. Conclusions: Although the perioperative bacteriological culture does not seem to be useful for predicting the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia, it is useful for predicting the pathogenic bacteria responsible for pneumonia in cases of postoperative pneumonia.

Added that a paucity of studies referred to ESKAPEEc in pediatric BSIs, our study aimed to demonstrate the longitudinal alterations of ESKAPEEc distribution and antibiogram in adult and pediatric BSIs in Southwest China. Methods: A multicenter retrospective surveillance study was launched from 2012 to 2017. Data of China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) was analyzed by Whonet 5.6 and Graphpad Prism 6 Software. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to examine and compare temporal changes. Results: A total of 32,259 strains was isolated, with 17.4% from pediatric BSIs. ESKAPEEc contributed to 58.67% (18,924/32,259) of BSIs, with 65.3% of adult BSIs and 27.2% of pediatric BSIs. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) were the two predominant species. Carbapenem resistance was prevalent in 0.76, 4.60, 9.47,13.66, 59.47% of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), respectively. The proportions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREFM) were 28.91% and 2.20%, respectively. Between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, E. coli and K. pneumonia showed significantly increased resistance rates to imipenem but decreased to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, while A. baumannii exhibited reduced resistances to almost all the beta-lactams tested. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to most of agents against Gram-positive ESKAPEEc did not significantly varied during the same timeframe. In comparison with those from adult BSIs, K. pneumoniae from pediatric BSIs exhibited high resistance rates to all the beta-lactams tested, especially to carbapenems (12.79% vs 3.87%), while A. baumannii showed low resistance rates to all the agents. Conclusions: Ongoing burden of ESKAPEEc in BSIs and increasing trend of imipenem resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae call for continued surveillance. Carbapenems are still active against Gram-negative ESKAPEEc, except for A. baumannii and vancomycin or linezolid is still effective against Gram-positive ESKAPEEc. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in children and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii in adults necessitate effective antimicrobial strategies in consideration of age stratification."

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low.

Materials and Methods: A total of 120 unique CRE clinical isolates were collected and carbapenemase genes were detected using PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using standard broth microdilution method and the results were interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints. Results: The 120 carbapenem-resistant strains included 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Escherichia coli, 10 Enterobacter cloacae, five Klebsiella aerogenes, and three Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Seventy-four percent of these 120 CRE isolates were collected from patients located in non-ICUs; 65.0% of these CRE isolates were collected from male patients; and 34.2% of these isolates were isolated from respiratory tracts. Four different carbapenemase genes were identified among 103 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates, including bla KPC-2 (n=77), bla NDM-1 (n=16), bla NDM-5 (n=12) and bla IMP-4 (n=2). Overall, 21.7%, 37.5%, 40.8%, 75.0%, and 100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, CAZ/AVI, and ATM/AVI, respectively. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 96.7% isolates (n=116) were resistant to aztreonam, and the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) significantly reduced the MICs of those aztreonam-resistant isolates by more than 128-fold (range: <=0.125-4 mg/L), and 90.0% (n=108) of total 120 isolates were inhibited at ATM/AVI concentration <=1 mg/L. Conclusion: Our study revealed significant antimicrobial resistance among the CRE isolates against some commonly used antibiotics in three secondary Chinese hospitals.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to rapidly investigate the clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene detection and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 31 CPE isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K. pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3); one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by Illumina sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: While CPE prevalence has declined substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. Increased surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts, as well as identification of optimal treatment approaches for CPE, will be needed to mitigate their future impact."

The infections included septicaemia (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). The most frequent bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (14), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5), Proteus spp. (5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4). The initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. In the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. Eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. All of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. Superinfection with streptococcus group D, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. The emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of E. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of K. pneumoniae. No adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled Gram-negative infection."

","SPECIES:Enterobacter cloacaeID:4073097TITLE:Lower respiratory tract infection.ABSTRACT:The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia."

Most of the responsible micro-organisms were multiresistant, but were initially sensitive to ceftazidime. They included 16 Pseudomonas spp., 10 Serratia spp., 6 Klebsiella spp., 7 other Enterobacteriaceae, 3 Staphylococcus spp., 3 strict anaerobes and 1 Acinetobacter anitratus. Indications for ceftazidime encompassed a broad spectrum of diseases: 10 complicated UTI, 13 skeletal and soft tissue infections, 4 bronchopulmonary infections, 6 intra-abdominal infections, 3 septicaemias, 1 brain abscess with meningitis. Ceftazidime was administered without other antimicrobials, except for metronidazole in two patients with intra-abdominal abscesses. Doses varied from 2 to 12 g/day (median: 3 g), given for 3-31 days (median: 12 days). Clinical cure was recorded in 26 patients (81%), 24 (75%) having also a bacteriological cure. In six patients, clinical findings subsided significantly but with incomplete resolution or relapse during follow-up. Four organisms developed resistance during therapy: 2 Pseudomonas, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Bacteroides vulgatus. Three patients developed mild superinfections (2 Candida, 1 Staph. epidermidis). Ceftazidime was well tolerated; adverse events were mild and reversible. Local thrombophlebitis was observed twice, two patients had a positive reaction to the direct Coombs' test, two had transitory elevation of transaminases and one suffered from drowsiness during intravenous injections. Ceftazidime appeared to be a valuable weapon for fighting severe infections in compromised patients, especially when Gram-negative bacilli were involved."

A five-year prospective study.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. Two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous BMT recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. Etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. Thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. Bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). Mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (P = 0.03). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. During the first 100 days after BMT, hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter lwoffi, and Enterobacter cloacae. After day +100, community-acquired, Gram-positive bacteria predominated, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. Considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (P &lt; 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P &lt; 0.02). For culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and VOD was significant (P &lt; 0.001) and borderline for acute GVHD (P = 0.07). It is concluded that VOD and GVHD are positively associated with post-BMT bacterial pneumonia. Its incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment."

After exposure, he noticed eye discomfort, chest tightness, headache and weakness of the lower limbs and oropharyngeal muscles. Despite these symptoms, he visited a hot spring on the same day with his family. On March 25 th, his muscle weakness progressed, and a low grade fever appeared. His muscle weakness disappeared 8 days after exposure to sarin, but respiratory failure rapidly developed, necessitating artificial ventilation within four day after hospitalization on March 28th. Chemotherapy with erythromycin, imipenem/cilastatin, and steroid pulse therapy was begu. PCR and culture of sputum collected by bronchofiberscopy were positive for Legionella pneumophila, serogroup I. His respiratory state improved, but subsequent infection with Pseudomonous aeruginosa. Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida tropicalis/glabrata caused his death 71 days after admission. Oropharyngeal muscle weakness caused by sarin-mediated cholinesterase inhibition was strongly suspected as the cause of hot spring water aspiration. Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed organizing pneumonia with fibrosis. Bronchoscopic findings included redness, edema and fragility of all visible areas of the airway, which was thought to be due to bronchitis caused by Legionellosis."

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective investigation involved 41 BSI infants (study group) and 50 GNB airway colonized infants who had sepsis workup with negative blood cultures (control group). We correlated clinical findings (95 blood and 305 tracheal aspirate (TA) cultures) with radiographic findings noted within 2 days before, the day of, and the day after blood cultures. Two radiologists independently graded 258 films using a modified score for BPD and a semiquantitative score (""probable,"" ""possible,"" or ""unlikely"") for pneumonia. RESULTS: Mean birth weight was 1057 gm and 1044 gm for the study and control groups, respectively. Of the study population, 54% were male, 21% were black, 89% received surfactant, 79% received dexamethasone, and 88% survived. Average age at the time of blood cultures for both groups was 23 days. Most common isolates from blood and TA were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eight BSI infants died, mainly as a result of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae; three control patients also died. Radiological findings were that BPD scores did not change in relation to BSI and were similar between study and control groups. Of the BSI patients, 21 presented with newly positive TA at the time of positive blood culture; ""probable"" or ""possible"" pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 of them. Their BPD scores were higher than those of the remaining BSI patients, of whom seven were already airway colonized, nine had negative TAs, and four were not intubated. Only one of these 20 patients had ""possible"" pneumonia noted on chest x-ray films. CONCLUSION: Radiographic signs of air space disease accompanied by the recovery of GNB respiratory pathogens from the blood and from a previously uncolonized airway strongly support the clinical diagnosis of GNB nosocomial pneumonia. Radiological signs of BPD are stable in relation to nosocomial BSI caused by GNB, but BPD radiological scores are higher among infants who also had a newly acquired respiratory GNB. BSI, new respiratory tract GNB, and BPD are critical associations for the clinical interpretation of radiographic changes in the ventilated newborn."

Aetiological factors of these infections can have an impact on treatment effects, treatment duration and mortality. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and microbiological profile of HAIs in patients hospitalized in an ICU over a span of 10 years. The active surveillance method was used to detect HAIs in adult patients who spent over 48 h in a general ICU ward located in southern Poland between 2007 and 2016. The study was conducted in compliance with the methodology recommended by the Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). During the 10 years of the study, 1849 patients hospitalized in an ICU for a total of 17,599 days acquired 510 with overall HAIs rates of 27.6% and 29.0% infections per 1000 ICU days. Intubation-associated pneumonia (IAP) posed the greatest risk (15.2 per 1000 ventilator days), followed by CLA-BSI (8.0 per 1000 catheter days) and CA-UTI (3.0 per 1000 catheter days). The most common isolated microorganism was Acinetobacter baumannii (25%) followed by Coagulaase-negativ staphylococci (15%), Escherichia coli (9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Candida albicans (6%). Acinetobacter baumannii in 87% and were classified as extensive-drug resistant (XDR). In summary, in ICU patients pneumonia and bloodstream infections were the most frequently found. Acinetobacter baumannii strains were most often isolated from clinical materials taken from HAI patients and showed resistance to many groups of antibiotics. A trend of increasing resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii to carbapenems was observed."

We sought to investigate the effects of viral-bacterial codetection on pneumonia severity and recurrent wheezing. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on neonates admitted to our hospital with pneumonia from 2009 to 2015. Of 606 total cases, 341 were diagnosed with RSV only, and 265 were diagnosed with both RSV and a potential bacterial pathogen. The leading four species of bacteria codetected with RSV were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter cloacae. Neonates with RSV and a potential bacterial pathogen were significantly more likely to have worse symptoms, higher C-reactive protein values and more abnormal chest x-ray manifestations with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (P &lt; 0.01). On Cox regression analysis, an increased risk of recurrent wheezing was found for neonates positive for RSV-Staphylococcus aureus and RSV-Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our findings indicate that the combination of bacteria and RSV in the neonatal airway is associated with more serious clinical characteristics. The presence of RSV and Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae may provide predictive markers for wheeze."

We performed a retrospective analysis of prevalence and treatment for CRE infections patients. METHODS: This study was conducted in three tertiary care hospitals from January 1, 2010 to December 30, 2016. Baseline data, treatment, and outcomes were collected in patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), bacteremia, complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI)/acute pyelonephritis (AP), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), superficial wound infection (SWI), biliary tract infection (BTI), deep wound infection (DWI) and sterile body fluids infection (SBFI) due to CRE. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four cases of CRE infection were identified: 31 VABP, 22 bacteremia, 18 cUTI/AP, 16 HABP, 16 SWI, 9 BTI, 7 DWI and 5 SBFI. The patient population had significant immunocompromised (33 of 124, 26.6%) and severe sepsis (43 of 124, 34.7%). The most common CRE pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (84 of 124, 67.7%) and Enterobacter cloacae (24 of 124, 19.4%). And the production of IMP-type carbapenemase was the main antibiotic resistance mechanism. The majority of patients to take monotherapy for empiric therapy and dual therapy for direct treatment. Outcomes were universally poor (28-day mortality was 22.6%, 28 of 124) across all sites of infection. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a large number of cases of CRE infection in 7 years from different parts, most of these pathogens have been confirmed to produce IMP-type carbapenemases. The retrospective analysis of cases of such bacterial infections will help to control future infections of these pathogens. Despite the high mortality rate, we still found that the selection of quinolone antibiotics can be effective in the treatment of CRE producing IMP type enzymes."

","SPECIES:Escherichia coliID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

We set out to address the microbial aetiology, antibiotic resistance and treatment outcomes in patients with HCAP and HAP. METHODS: 318 consenting patients with HCAP (n = 165, aged 16-90 years; median 60 years; 97 males) or HAP (n = 153; aged 16-85 years; median 45 years; 92 males) presenting to a tertiary care hospital in North India from 2013 to 2015 were prospectively recruited for the study. Data on patient characteristics, microbial aetiology, APACHE II scores, treatment outcomes and mortality were studied. Clinical outcomes were compared with various possible predictors employing logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients in HCAP had more comorbidity. Escherichia coli (30, 18%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (62, 41%) were the most commonly isolated bacteria in HCAP and HAP, respectively. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated more frequently in HCAP, only because the incidence of extensively drug-resistant bacteria was markedly high in HAP (p = 0.00). The mean APACHE II score was lower in HCAP (17.55 +- 6.406, range 30) compared to HAP (19.74 +- 8.843, range 37; p = 0.013). The length of stay &gt;= 5 days (p = 0.036) and in-hospital mortality was higher in HAP group (p = 0.002). The most reliable predictors of in-hospital mortality in HCAP and HAP were APACHE II score &gt;= 17 (OR = 14, p = 0.00; HAP: OR = 10.8, p = 0.00), and septic shock (OR = 4.5, p = 0.00; HAP: OR = 6.9, p = 0.00). CONCLUSION: The patient characteristics in HCAP, treatment outcomes, bacterial aetiology, and a higher incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, suggest that HCAP although not as severe as HAP, can be grouped as a separate third entity."

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and etiological agents of HAI in a Surgical ICU in Kazakhstan, and to assess the impact of these infections on ICU stay and mortality. Objective: To assess the rate of device-associated infections and causative HAI etiological agents in an ICU at the National Research Center for Oncology and Transplantation (NRCOT) in Astana, Kazakhstan. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a 12-bed ICU at the NRCOT, Astana, Kazakhstan. We enrolled all patients who were admitted to the ICU from January, 2014 through November 2015, aged 18 to 90 years of age who developed an HAI. Results: The most common type of HAI was surgical site infection (SSI), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related blood stream infection (BSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI). The most common HAI was SSI with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most common etiological agent. The second most common HAI was VAP also with P. aeruginosa followed by BSI which was also associated with P. aeruginosa (in 2014) and Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (in 2015) as the most common etiological agents causing these infections. Conclusion: We found that HAI among our study population were predominantly caused by gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the only study that describes ICU-related HAI situation from a country within the Central Asian region. Many developing countries such as Kazakhstan lack surveillance systems which could effectively decrease incidence of HAIs and healthcare costs for their treatment. The epidemiological data on HAI in Kazakhstan currently is underrepresented and poorly reported in the literature. Based on this and previous studies, we propose that the most important interventions to prevent HAI at the NRCOT and similar Healthcare Institutions in Kazakhstan are active surveillance, regular infection control audits, rational and effective antibacterial therapy, and general hygiene measures."

We aimed to review existing literature to identify organisms responsible for pneumonia complicating stroke, before developing a consensus-based approach to antibiotic treatment. METHODS: A systematic literature review of multiple electronic databases using predefined search criteria was undertaken, in accordance with Cochrane and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance. Published studies of hospitalized adults with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or both, which identified microbiological etiologies for pneumonia complicating stroke up to January 1, 2017, were considered. Analysis included summary statistics and random-effects meta-analysis where appropriate. RESULTS: Fifteen studies (40% ischemic stroke, 60% ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage) involving 7968 patients were included. Reported occurrence of pneumonia varied considerably between studies (2%-63%) with a pooled frequency of 23% (95% confidence interval, 14%-34%; I2=99%). Where reported (60%), the majority of pneumonia occurred within 1 week of stroke (78%). Reported frequency of positive culture data (15%-88%) varied widely. When isolated, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (38%) and Gram-positive cocci (16%) were most frequently cultured; commonly isolated organisms included Enterobacteriaceae (21.8%: Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.8% and Escherichia coli, 9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), Acinetobacter baumanii (4.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.5%). Sputum was most commonly used to identify pathogens, in isolation (40%) or in conjunction with tracheal aspirate (15%) or blood culture (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Although the analysis was limited by small and heterogeneous study populations, limiting determination of microbiological causality, this review suggests aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci are frequently associated with pneumonia complicating stroke. This supports the need for appropriately designed studies to determine microbial cause and a consensus-based approach in antibiotic usage and further targeted antibiotic treatment trials for enhanced antibiotic stewardship."

The majority of strains were isolated from patients were with hospital-acquired pneumonia (37/59, 62.7%), followed by community-acquired pneumonia (13/59, 22.0%), and ventilator-related pneumonia (9/59, 15.3%). The E. coli ST131 (9 isolates, 29.0%) and K. pneumoniae ST11 (5 isolates, 17.9%) were the predominant sub-types. The most prevalent ESBL gene was CTX-M-14, followed by SHV-77, CTX-M-3, SHV-11, and CTX-M-27. At least 33 (55.9%) of the ESBL-producing strains carried two or more ESBL genes. The ISEcp1 and IS26 were found upstream of all blaCTX-M (CTX-Ms) and of most blaSHV (SHVs) (57.6%), respectively. Moreover, three ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 strains which were resistant to carbapenems carried the blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2, two of which also bearing blaOXA-48 were resistant to all antibiotics (including Tigecycline). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired pneumonia is more likely correlated with ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. ESBL-producing E. coli ST131 and multi-drug resistance ESBL-producing, as well as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases-2 (KPC-2) bearing K. pneumoniae ST11 are spreading in patients with pneumonia in hospital."

METHODS: Real-time surveillance was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All HAIs were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly >=60 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, chi2 = 202.421, P < 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower. CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher overall incidence of HAI in elderly inpatients >=60 compared to non-elderly inpatients < 60 years, but the trend was different for device-associated HAIs, which was attributed to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in the elderly group. The main HAI sites in elderly inpatients were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and bloodstream, and the main pathogens were gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans."

During a two-month study period, 154 (mean age: 75.2 ++ 12.2 years; 94 males) out of 620 (24.8%) hospitalized patients underwent 174 blood cultures and were enrolled in the study. The rate of true-positive cultures was 11.5% (20/174) and the rate of false-positive (contaminants) was 5.7% (10/174). A total of 23 microorganisms (5 multidrug resistant strains), most frequently Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), were isolated. The positivity rate was significantly higher in patients with urinary tract infection (31%) and abdomen infection (26.1%) than in patients with pneumonia (4.9%; p<0.01). Although the positivity rate in patients exposed to antibiotics was lower than in those not exposed, the difference was not statistically significant. Therapy changes due to blood culture positivity were observed in 7.1% of the patients overall. In-hospital death was observed in nine of the 136 patients with negative blood cultures (6.6%) and in none of the 18 patients with positive blood cultures. These results indicate that the yield and clinical impact of blood cultures is quite low in patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward and suggest the need to improve the adequacy of the indications to perform the test."

After 3 days of treatment with gentamicin, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) changed from less than 1 mg/L to more than 16 mg/L. It appears that suboptimal gentamicin dosing led to the development of gentamicin resistance. As the patient was not improving clinically, the antibiotics were changed once the gentamicin resistance was identified. To minimize resistance and treatment failure, clinicians should consider the patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameters, achieved peak level, and the amount of time the gentamicin level will remain below the MIC of the organism being treated."

However, such data have seldom been validated against microbiological laboratory results. Objective: To assess the validity of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) organism-specific administrative codes for pneumonia using microbiological data (test results for blood or respiratory culture, urinary antigen, or polymerase chain reaction) as the criterion standard. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study conducted between February 2017 and June 2019 using data from 178 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. Patients were aged 18 years or older admitted with pneumonia and discharged between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015. Data were analyzed from February 14, 2017, to June 27, 2019. Exposures: Organism-specific pneumonia identified from ICD-9 codes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ICD-9 codes using microbiological data as the criterion standard. Results: Of 161 529 patients meeting inclusion criteria (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [16.2] years; 51.2% women), 35 759 (22.1%) had an identified pathogen. ICD-9-coded organisms and laboratory findings differed notably: for example, ICD-9 codes identified only 14.2% and 17.3% of patients with laboratory-detected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Although specificities and negative predictive values exceeded 95% for all codes, sensitivities ranged downward from 95.9% (95% CI, 95.3%-96.5%) for influenza virus to 14.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-20.8%) for parainfluenza virus, and positive predictive values ranged downward from 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.6%) for Staphylococcus aureus to 57.1% (95% CI, 39.4%-73.7%) for parainfluenza virus. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, ICD-9 codes did not reliably capture pneumonia etiology identified by laboratory testing; because of the high specificities of ICD-9 codes, however, administrative data may be useful in identifying risk factors for resistant organisms. The low sensitivities of the diagnosis codes may limit the validity of organism-specific pneumonia prevalence estimates derived from administrative data."

The present study was designed to discover the frequency of ESBL-production among the clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study also focused on determining their liability to the selected antimicrobials. METHODS: Two hundred ten (210) clinical specimens were tested for the occurrence of ESBL using the double-disc synergy test. The molecular, physicochemical, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity were checked through an online server. RESULTS: Among the screened clinical isolates, E. coli (n=44), K. pneumonia (n=34) and P. aeruginosa (n=14) were ESBL markers. The ESBL producing isolates exhibited co-resistance to diverse categories of antibiotics. It was observed that all the ESBL-producing isolates were sensitive towards imipenem and faropenem with minimal proportion of resistance. CONCLUSION: The imipenem and faropenem can be recommended as the drugs of selection due to a lesser amount of resistance as compared to other antibiotics in this study."

Identification of the pathogens is crucial in the management of CAP. This study was done to determine the common bacterial pathogens, treatment outcomes and associated factors for microbiological confirmed CAP among adults attending the Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure hospital in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods: This was a hospital based cross sectional study involving patients with community acquired pneumonia attending Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure regional Hospital. Demographic and other data were collected using standardized data collection tool. Sputum culture was done followed by identification of the isolates and antibiotics susceptibility testing. Results: A total of 353 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 353 sputum samples, 265(75%) were of good quality. Of 353 non-repetitive sputum cultures, 72/353 (20.4, 95% CI: 16.2-24.6) were positive for the bacterial pathogens with five patients having more than one pathogen. Good quality sputa had significantly higher yield of pathogenic bacteria than poor quality sputa (26.1% vs.3.4%, P = 0.001). The majority 64 (83.1%) of the isolates were gram negative bacteria. Common bacteria isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae 23/77(29.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 10/77 (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9/77 (11.7%) and Escherichia coli 7/77 (9.1%). Of 23 K. pneumoniae isolates, 20/23 (87.0%) were resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ceftriaxone was found to be associated with prolongation of CAP symptoms (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Gram negative bacteria resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were most frequently isolated bacteria among adults' patients with CAP attending BMC and Sekou Toure hospital. Routine sputum culture should be performed to guide appropriate treatment of CAP among adults in developing countries."

Methods: A total of 286 cases of pediatic liver transplantation recipients, who came from Tianjin First Central Hospital during August 1,2017 to August 1, 2018, were retrospectively investigated. The clinical characteristics, antibiotic susceptibity test, treatment outcomes and prognosis of CRE infection patients were analyzed. CRE colonization were screened by rectal swabs after liver transplantation. All cases were divided into CRE colonization group and non-CRE colonization group based on CRE colonization results. The high risk factors of CRE colonization and its relationship with CRE infection were investigated. chi(2) test was used for the comparison between groups.The single-factor analysis was used to screen risk factors. Results: The 286 cases included 132 male and 154 female cases. The age was (8+-4) months.CRE infection rate after liver transplantation was 7.3% (21/286). The time of CRE infection was the 5(th) (1(th)-14(th)) days after transplantation. Abdominal infection was the most common (95.2%, 20/21), followed by bloodstream infection (12 cases) and pulmonary infection (8 cases). Infection in two or more sites accounted for 71.4% (15/21); 27 CRE strains, in which 24 strains were carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (88.9%), 2 strains were carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (7.4%) and one strain was carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes (3.7%). The drug resistance rate of CRE strains to carbapenems, penicillin antibiotics, second-and third-generation cephalosporin was 100.0%. Medication treatment included meropenem+fosfomycin (13 cases) and meropenem+tegacycline (8 cases). The treatment was effective in 16 cases and the time was 19 (1-27) d. The 1-year survival rate among CRE infection group and non-CRE infection group were 71.4% (15/21) and 98.1% (260/265), respectively (chi(2)=37.460, P<0.01). CRE infection rate among CRE colonization group and non-CRE colonization group were 26.4% (19/72) and 0.9% (2/214), respectively (chi(2)=51.300, P<0.01). Factors before transplantation, including third-generation cephalosporin or carbapenems exposure, prolonged hospital stay within 3 months, CRE infection, and factors after transplantation, including emergency surgery, mechanical ventilation more than 24 hours (chi(2)=20.570, 6.411, 13.960, 14.600, 9.560, all P<0.01) were high risk factors for CRE colonization. Conclusions: The prognosis of CRE infection after pediatric liver transplantation is poor. Timely diagnosis and treatment are of great importance. Much attention should be paid on CRE rectal colonization and its risk factors. Screening of CRE colonization is important for early warning and control of CRE infection."

The emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB) has become a public health problem, creating a new burden on medical care in hospitals, particularly for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). AIM: To describe risk factors for ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) in patients with cancer and to evaluate the impact of MDRB. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed from January 2016 to December 2018 at a cancer referral center in Mexico City, which included all patients who were admitted to the ICU and required MV >= 48 h. They were classified as those who developed VAP versus those who did not; pathogens isolated, including MDRB. Clinical evolution at 60-d was assessed. Descriptive analysis was carried out; comparison was performed between VAP vs non-VAP and MDRB vs non-MDRB. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three patients were included in the study; mean age was 51.9 years; 52.1% were male; 68.4% had solid tumors. There were 32 episodes of VAP with a rate of 12.2%; 11.5 episodes/1000 ventilation-days. The most frequent bacteria isolated were the following: Klebsiella spp. [n = 9, four were Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producers, one was Carbapenem-resistant (CR)]; Escherichia coli (n = 5, one was ESBL), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8, two were CR). One Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was identified. In multivariate analysis, the sole risk factor associated for VAP was length of ICU stay (OR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.03-1.17; P = 0.003). Sixty-day mortality was 53% in VAP and 43% without VAP (P = 0.342). There was not higher mortality in those patients with MDRB. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the high percentage of Gram-negative bacteria, which allows the initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage for these pathogens. In this retrospective, single center, observational study, MDRB VAP was not directly linked to increased mortality at 60 days."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%. The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem increased annually. The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones, Aminoglycosides were <5% even when compared to carbapenems. Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

Rectal colonization with CPE is a risk factor for bacterial translocation leading to subsequent endogenous CPE infections. This prospective observational study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of rectal colonization of CPE, the carbapenemase genotypes, and to identify the independent risk factors for the acquisition of CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards in a university hospital in China. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 150 fecal samples from rectal swabs were consecutively obtained for inpatients from the intensive care unit (ICU) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) wards from November 2018 to May 2019, and screening test for CPE was conducted by using prepared in-house trypsin soybean broth (TSB) selective media and MacConkey agar. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method and carbapenemase genes were characterized by both the GeneXpert Carba-R and PCR for blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM and blaOXA. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to characterize the genetic relationships among the carbapenemase-producing K. Pneumonia (CPKP) isolates. In order to further investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of CPE colonization, a prospective case-control study was also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six suspected CPE strains, including 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1 Enterobacter Kobe, and 1 Raoultella ornithinolytica, were identified in 25 non-duplicated rectal swab samples from 25 patients, with a carriage rate of 16.67% (25/150). Through GeneXpert Carba-R and subsequent PCR and sequencing, all the suspected CPE isolates were identified to be positive for the carbapenemase genes, of which 17 were blaKPC-carriers, and another 9 were blaNDM-producers. MLST designated all the CPKP isolates to be ST11 clone. Multivariate analysis indicated that urinary system diseases, operation of bronchoscopy, and combined use of antibiotics were independent risk factors for acquiring CPE colonization in high-risk patients from the ICU and HSCT wards. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high prevalence of rectal CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards, and a predominant colonization of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae clone ST11. Stricter infection control measures are urgently needed to limit the dissemination of CPE strains, especially in patients who were afflicted by urinary system diseases, have underwent bronchoscopy, and were previously exposed to combined antibiotic use."

Hence, this study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and resistance patterns of pathogens among patients who visited a tertiary hospital in the study setting. Methods: This study was based on secondary data sources from the hospital microbiology database and culture reports between September 2019 and August 2020 at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospitals, Ethiopia. Data about socio-demographic characteristics and clinical parameters, types of specimens collected, culture results, and antibiotic resistance pattern were collected manually by using a data abstraction format from the department of clinical bacteriology registration book and electronic database. Results: A total of 5328 culture results were included in the final analysis. Bacterial growth was documented only in 803 (15.1%) samples. From the positive culture results documented, the highest positivity rate was reported from abscess (47.8%) followed by blood (26.2%) and urine (15.1%) samples. Among the bacterial isolates S. aureus (32.5%), Klebsiella species (17.9%), E. coli (14.8%) and Streptococcus species (7.4%) were the commonly identified organisms. Of the 803 bacterial isolates, about 672 (83.6%) isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 19.7% isolates were MDR. Conclusion: This study showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia species, and Escherichia coli were the commonest isolated pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance among common isolates was high for most routinely used antibiotics, and some reserved drugs like carbapenems and fourth-generation cephalosporin. Thus, this study may have implications on patient management, drug procurement, local treatment guideline development, and rational use of antibiotics. Furthermore, this finding could also help to facilitate the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control interventions within the hospital."

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S29 criteria were used for interpretation, and the WHONET-5.6 software was used in data analysis. Results: A total of 1 590 cases were collected, including 831 cases from BSI, 450 cases from HAP and 309 cases from IAI. The most prevalent pathogens causing BSI were Escherichia coli (29.2%, 243/831), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%, 135/831) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%, 84/831); the most prevalent pathogens causing IAI were E. coli (26.2%, 81/309), Enterococcus faecium (15.5%, 48/309) and K. pneumoniae (13.3%, 41/309); while Acinetobacter baumanii (24.7%, 111/450), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%, 93/450) and K. pneumoniae (16.2%, 73/450) were dominated in HAP. All S. aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides; 77.8% (105/135) of S. aureus strains were susceptible to ceftaroline. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.6% (40/135) of all the S. aureus, and was lower than the accounted rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) (83.7%, 41/49). One E. faecium strain (1.1%, 1/95) resistant to vacomycin and teicoplanin and one E. faecalis strain (2.3%, 1/43) resistant to linezolid was found. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 56.1% (193/344) in E. coli and 22.1% (55/249) in K. pneumonia; the rate of carbapenem resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 4.1% (14/344) and 22.9% (57/249), respectively; the percentage of ceftazidime/avibactam resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 2.3% (8/344) and 2.0% (5/249), respectively; the percentage of colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 1.5% (5/344) and 7.6% (19/249), respectively; no E. coli and K. pneumonia strains were found resistant to tigecycline. The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa were 78.9% (146/185) and 36.7% (66/180), respectively. A. baumanii showed low susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents except colistin (99.5%, 184/185) and tigecycline (91.4%, 169/185). Colistin, amikacin and ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa with susceptility rate of 100% (180/180), 93.3% (168/180) and 85.6% (154/180), respectively. Conclusions: Nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens show high susceptibilities to tigecycline, colistin and ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro. Antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii is a serious problem. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has increased, which should be monitored continuously in China."

However, clinical information with respect to its utilization in infection caused by ESBL producers is limited. The aim of this study was a comparison of mortality rates of loading dose (LD) colistin and carbapenems as definitive therapies in a cohort of patients with infections caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A retrospective cohort study in 396 patients with ESBL-producing E.coli and K.pneumoniae infection at a university-affiliated hospital was conducted between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2015 to compare outcomes of infected patients who received LD colistin (95 patients) with carbapenems (301 patients). The three primary outcomes were 30-day mortality, clinical response and microbiological response. The most common infection types were urinary tract infection (49.49%), followed by pneumonia (40.66%), bacteremia (13.64%), skin and soft tissue infections (4.80%) and intra-abdominal infection (3.03%). LD colistin group provided higher 30-day mortality when compared with carbapenems group (HR 7.97; 95% CI 3.68 to 17.25; P = 0.001). LD colistin was also independently associated with clinical failure (HR 4.30; 95% CI 1.93 to 9.57; P = 0.001) and bacteriological failure (HR 9.49; 95% CI 3.76 to 23.96; P = 0.001) when compared with those who received carbapenems. LD colistin treatment was associated with poorer outcomes, i.e. mortality rate, clinical response and microbiological response. Moreover, when adjusted confounding factors, LD colistin was still less effective than carbapenems. It should be noted that, however, the use of Vitek-2 to assess colistin susceptibility could provide inaccurate results. Also, the difference in baseline characteristics could still remain in retrospective study although compensation by hazard ratio adjustment was performed. Therefore, clinical utilization of LD colistin should be recommended as an alternative for treatment ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae only in the circumstances where carbapenems cannot be utilized, but this recommendation must be considered carefully."

The only previously reported outbreak of pneumonic tularemia in the United States also occurred on the island in 1978. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of adults with pneumonic tularemia and investigated the environment to identify risk factors for primary pneumonic tularemia. Patients with confirmed cases were residents of or visitors to Martha's Vineyard who had symptoms suggestive of primary pneumonic tularemia, were ill between May 15 and October 31, 2000, and had a positive laboratory test for tularemia. Controls were adults who had spent at least 15 days on Martha's Vineyard between May 15 and September 28, 2000. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients with tularemia; 11 of these cases were primary pneumonic tularemia. Francisella tularensis type A was isolated from blood and lung tissue of the one man who died. Patients were more likely than controls to have used a lawn mower or brush cutter in the two weeks before the illness or before an interview, for controls (odds ratio, 9.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 68.0) and during the summer (odds ratio, undefined; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to infinity). Lawn mowing and brush cutting remained significant risk factors after adjustment for other potentially confounding variables. Only one patient reported being exposed to a rabbit while cutting brush. Of 40 trapped animals, 1 striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) and 1 Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) were seropositive for antibodies against F. tularensis. CONCLUSIONS: Study of this outbreak of primary pneumonic tularemia implicates lawn mowing and brush cutting as risk factors for this infection."

Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and evidence of elevated agglutinating antibodies to F. tularensis (&gt; 1:128). We report a case of primary tularemic pneumonia presenting with pulmonary infiltrates and necrotizing mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in an otherwise healthy subject from a non-endemic area.

","SPECIES:Francisella hispanensisID:16669925TITLE:The atypical pneumonias: clinical diagnosis and importance.ABSTRACT:The most common atypical pneumonias are caused by three zoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and three nonzoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella. These atypical agents, unlike the typical pathogens, often cause extrapulmonary manifestations. Atypical CAPs are systemic infectious diseases with a pulmonary component and may be differentiated clinically from typical CAPs by the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement which is characteristic for each atypical CAP. Zoonotic pneumonias may be eliminated from diagnostic consideration with a negative contact history. The commonest clinical problem is to differentiate legionnaire's disease from typical CAP as well as from C. pneumoniae or M. pneumonia infection. Legionella is the most important atypical pathogen in terms of severity. It may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP and other atypical pathogens by the use of a weighted point system of syndromic diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary features. Because legionnaire's disease often presents as severe CAP, a presumptive diagnosis of Legionella should prompt specific testing and empirical anti-Legionella therapy such as the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's weighted point score system. Most atypical pathogens are difficult or dangerous to isolate and a definitive laboratory diagnosis is usually based on indirect, i.e., direct flourescent antibody (DFA), indirect flourescent antibody (IFA). Atypical CAP is virtually always monomicrobial; increased IFA IgG tests indicate past exposure and not concurrent infection. Anti-Legionella antibiotics include macrolides, doxycycline, rifampin, quinolones, and telithromycin. The drugs with the highest level of anti-Legionella activity are quinolones and telithromycin. Therapy is usually continued for 2 weeks if potent anti-Legionella drugs are used. In adults, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may exacerbate or cause asthma. The importance of the atypical pneumonias is not related to their frequency (approximately 15% of CAPs), but to difficulties in their diagnosis, and their nonresponsiveness to beta-lactam therapy. Because of the potential role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), and the role of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in causing or exacerbating asthma, atypical CAPs also have public health importance."

","SPECIES:Francisella hispanensisID:17628200TITLE:Q fever community-acquired pneumonia in a patient with Crohn's disease on immunosuppressive therapy.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may be caused by typical or atypical pathogens. The three most common zoonotic atypical pathogens are Chlamydophila psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Atypical CAPs are suggested by a distinctive pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. Zoonotic CAP may be differentiated from nonzoonotic CAP (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionnaire's disease) by a recent zoonotic vector contact history. Zoonotic atypical CAP occurs sporadically, but not randomly, and require close association with the appropriate zoonotic vector to transmit the infection. CAP accompanied by the extrapulmonary finding of splenomegaly in a normal host limits differential diagnostic possibilities to Q fever and psittacosis. Splenomegaly does not occur with other typical or atypical CAP. Another common extrapulmonary finding occurs with some atypical pneumonias, that is, Q fever, psittacosis, and Legionnaire's disease is early mild/transient elevations of serum transaminases indicative of (hepatic) extrapulmonary organ involvement. The case presented is a middle-aged man with longstanding Crohn's disease who was further immunosuppressed by chronic prednisone therapy. The patient presented with CAP and extrapulmonary findings, that is, splenomegaly and increased serum transaminases. He denied recent contact with birds or animals. Because Crohn's disease and Q fever CAP may be accompanied by splenomegaly, the cause of his splenomegaly was a diagnostic dilemma. The patient was treated with levofloxacin. Serologic tests for atypical pathogens (Q fever, psittacosis, Legionnaire's disease, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) were ordered. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology for Q fever was positive with elevated acute immunoglobulin-M (phase II) titers. Re-questioning of the patient revealed a recent exposure to a neighbor's parturient cat, providing the necessary zoonotic vector contact history for Q fever. The patient responded to levofloxacin, which resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms, right lower lobe pneumonia, and splenomegaly. Because a prior abdominal computed tomography scan indicated no splenomegaly and his splenomegaly resolved with antimicrobial therapy, the splenomegaly was related to Q fever CAP."

A case of F philomiragia adenitis and lung nodules, refractory to cephalosporin therapy, is reported in a 10-year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease following a facial abrasion from a saltwater crab. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first Canadian clinical isolate to be reported. Genus and species identification was confirmed via 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis. A literature review revealed three groups at risk of F philomiragia infection: young patients with chronic granulomatous disease; adults with hematogenous malignancy; and near-drowning patients. Pneumonia, fever without an apparent source and sepsis are the main clinical presentations. Invasive procedures may be required to isolate this organism and ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

In the recent years tularemia has become a re-emerging infection in Turkey with epidemics and also sporadic cases. Transmission occurs most often through consumption of contaminated water and food, direct contact with animals and insect/ tick bites. In this study, we evaluated clinical features and laboratory findings of 35 tularemia cases diagnosed during two outbreaks that occurred in two different villages during two different periods in Konya (located in Central Anatolia), Turkey and five sporadic cases. In both outbreaks, first (index) cases were admitted to our outpatient clinic with the complaints of cervical lympadenopathy. After diagnosis of tularemia, an organized team visited the villages to search if more cases existed. For microbiological diagnosis, blood, throat and tonsil swabs and lymph node aspirate specimens were collected from the suspected cases. Diagnostic tests (culture, serology, molecular methods) for tularemia were performed in reference center, Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency. Drinking and potable water samples from those villages were also collected by provincial health authorities. The cases (n= 14) that belonged to the first epidemics were detected in February 2010 and cases (n= 21) of the second epidemics in November- December 2010; five cases were followed as sporadic. The mean age of the 40 patients (25 females, 15 males) was 37.6 (age range: 5-80 years; five of them were pediatric group) years. The most common complaints of patients were cervical mass (90%), sore throat (63%), chills (60%) and fever (58%). The most frequently detected clinical findings were enlarged lymph nodes (n= 34, 85%), followed by tonsillitis (20%), skin lesions (15%) and conjunctivitis (8%). Most of the patients (82.5%) had been misdignosed as acute tonsillitis, suppurative lymphadenitis, tuberculous lymphadenitis and brucellosis, before their admission to our hospital and treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Demographic analysis of the cases revealed that 68% of them lived in the rural area, 75% had rodents at home, 46% used natural water supplies, 53% fed animals, 15% had contact with game animals and 5% had contact with ticks. Clinical samples from the patients were found culture negative for F.tularensis. The diagnosis of the cases was based on the presence of specific F.tularensis antibodies between 1/160-1/1280 titers obtained by microagglutination test. Additionally F.tularensis DNA was demonstrated in three lymph node aspirate samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Water samples were found negative both by culture and PCR assays. However, it was detected that there were problems in the chlorination of water supplies in the two villages where epidemics were seen. All the patients were treated with streptomycin (2 x 1 g, intramuscular, 10 days), and surgical intervention was performed for the patients (n= 12) with extremely large lymph nodes and suppuration. Erythema nodosum developed in two patients following the end of treatment. Death or serious complications such as pneumonia or meningitis were not detected. In conclusion, tularemia should be considered in patients presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy, sore throat, fever and unresponsive to previous treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics. For the management of the disease, healthcare personnel and the community should be educated concerning the risk factors and precautions for tularemia."

We report our experience with a 14-year-old male adolescent with tularemia who presented with atypical pneumonia and possible infective endocarditis. Although the infectivity and mortality rates for tularemia are very high if left untreated, we did not suspect tularemia in this case until the incidental isolation of F. tularensis.

","SPECIES:Francisella hispanensisID:27175638TITLE:Case Report of Low Virulence Francisella tularensis Presented as Severe Bacteremic Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Tularemia is a zoonotic infection seen primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. It is caused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis. Although the ulceroglandular form of the disease is the more common manifestation of infection, F tularensis is known to cause pneumonia. F tularensis has two predominant subspecies, namely subsp. tularensis (type A) and subsp. holarctica (type B). Type B tularemia is considered to be much less virulent than type A and barely caused lethal disease and pneumonia.We reported a case with a 68-year-old man immune-compromised patient diagnosed with bacteremic pneumonia engendered by type B tularemia with initial presentation of high fever, pneumonia with pleural effusion; the diagnosis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The patient's fever, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were resolved with appropriate antibiotics for tularemia. This case involving severe bacteremic pneumonia in an immune-compromised patient is rare.This case suggests that low virulence F tularensis should be included in the differential diagnoses of bacteremic pneumonia for endemic tularemia.

In Finland, Northern Ostrobothnia is an endemic area of tularaemia with occasional seasonal outbreaks. METHODS: In our study, a consecutive series of 58 pneumonic tularaemia cases diagnosed and treated in Oulu University Hospital in 2000-2012 were retrospectively analysed in terms of epidemiology, clinical course, and prognosis. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonic tularaemia showed peaks in cycles of a few years and most cases were diagnosed in late summer or early autumn. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 47% of patients, and 7% had normal chest X-ray. The chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in 81% of patients, demonstrating variable findings associated with pneumonic tularaemia. Bronchoscopy was performed for 22 (38%) patients and four (18%) of these also proceeded into mediastinoscopy. Moreover, thoracoscopy was performed for one (2%) patient. Two (3%) patients were treated shortly in the intensive care unit (ICU) during their stay in hospital. No mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of pneumonic tularaemia are diagnosed during the seasonal outbreaks. The lack of specific symptoms often complicates the diagnosis and leads to unnecessarily invasive examinations."

","SPECIES:Francisella hispanensisID:32989563TITLE:Tularemia: a re-emerging tick-borne infectious disease.ABSTRACT:Tularemia is a bacterial disease of humans, wild, and domestic animals. Francisella tularensis, which is a Gram-negative coccobacillus-shaped bacterium, is the causative agent of tularemia. Recently, an increase in the number of human tularemia cases has been noticed in several countries around the world. It has been reported mostly from North America, several Scandinavian countries, and certain Asian countries. The disease spreads through vectors such as mosquitoes, horseflies, deer flies, and ticks. Humans can acquire the disease through direct contact of sick animals, consumption of infected animals, drinking or direct contact of contaminated water, and inhalation of bacteria-loaded aerosols. Low infectious dose, aerosol route of infection, and its ability to induce fatal disease make it a potential agent of biological warfare. Tularemia leads to several clinical forms, such as glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal forms. The disease is diagnosed through the use of culture, serology, or molecular methods. Quinolones, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides are frequently used in the treatment of tularemia. No licensed vaccine is available in the prophylaxis of tularemia and this is need of the time and high-priority research area. This review mostly focuses on general features, importance, current status, and preventive measures of this disease."

","SPECIES:Francisella hispanensisID:9097380TITLE:Tularemia pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Tularemia pneumonia may complicate the various clinical presentations of tularemia, or present as an uncommon zoonosis. Approximately 200 cases of tularemia are reported in the United States per year, and 10% to 20% present with pneumonia either as a primary event or as a complication of ulceroglandular or typhoidal tularemia. Tularemia pneumonia also occurs with the other tularemic forms, glandular, oculoglandular, and oropharyngeal tularemia as a result of secondary bacteremic spread to the lungs. Pneumonia usually occurs within 2 days to months after infection. The mortality rate of primary tularemic pneumonia and pneumonia complicating typhoidal tularemia is high. The clinical and roentgenographic presentations of tularemia pneumonia are highly variable and is one of the zoonotic atypical pneumonias. Tularemic pneumonia may mimic fungal and bacterial pneumonias, tuberculosis, or malignancy. The diagnosis of tularemic pneumonia should be considered in any patient presenting with an atypical pneumonia with the finding of an ulcer and/or lymphadenopathy and a history of outdoor activity. Serum agglutination tests and ELISA are the basis of serological diagnosis. Francisella tularensis can be cultured from the sputum, skin ulcer, pleural fluid, and the lymph nodes, but cultures should not be obtained because of the danger to laboratory personnel. The drug preferred for treatment of tularemic pneumonia is streptomycin for 1 to 2 weeks."

The only previously reported outbreak of pneumonic tularemia in the United States also occurred on the island in 1978. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of adults with pneumonic tularemia and investigated the environment to identify risk factors for primary pneumonic tularemia. Patients with confirmed cases were residents of or visitors to Martha's Vineyard who had symptoms suggestive of primary pneumonic tularemia, were ill between May 15 and October 31, 2000, and had a positive laboratory test for tularemia. Controls were adults who had spent at least 15 days on Martha's Vineyard between May 15 and September 28, 2000. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients with tularemia; 11 of these cases were primary pneumonic tularemia. Francisella tularensis type A was isolated from blood and lung tissue of the one man who died. Patients were more likely than controls to have used a lawn mower or brush cutter in the two weeks before the illness or before an interview, for controls (odds ratio, 9.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 68.0) and during the summer (odds ratio, undefined; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to infinity). Lawn mowing and brush cutting remained significant risk factors after adjustment for other potentially confounding variables. Only one patient reported being exposed to a rabbit while cutting brush. Of 40 trapped animals, 1 striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) and 1 Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) were seropositive for antibodies against F. tularensis. CONCLUSIONS: Study of this outbreak of primary pneumonic tularemia implicates lawn mowing and brush cutting as risk factors for this infection."

","SPECIES:Francisella tularensisID:12608453TITLE:Tularaemia.ABSTRACT:Tularaemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease of the Northern hemisphere. The causative agent, Francisella tularensis, is spread to humans by direct contact with infected rodents or lagomorphs, aerogenic exposure, ingestion of contaminated food or water, or by arthropod bites. The prevalence of tularaemia shows a wide geographic variation. In some endemic regions, outbreaks occur frequently, whereas nearby rural parts of a country may be completely free. F. tularensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen and its primary mammalian target cell is the mononuclear phagocyte. When tularaemia is acquired via the skin, a primary ulcer is often detected and in general, regional lymph nodes become prominently enlarged. When contracted by inhalation, the disease may present with pneumonia. Nearly as frequent, however, is the development of fever and general illness with no respiratory symptoms and no pulmonary radiological changes. When present, the changes vary widely and may sometimes include hilar enlargement indistinguishable from that of lymphoma. Within an outbreak, the first case of tularaemia is not always readily diagnosed. A decade may have lapsed since the disease was encountered and its existence may be more or less forgotten. The difficulty refers especially to the respiratory form, in which symptoms are less specific. In cases of atypical pneumonia or acute febrile disease with no local symptoms, a history of exposure to hares or rodents or merely living in an endemic region should be sufficient to include tularaemia among differential diagnoses. The microbiological diagnosis of tularaemia relies mainly on serology, and the treatment on broad-spectrum antibiotics. For decades, a live vaccine has been successfully used in risk groups but is presently not available due to difficulties in standardisation."

","SPECIES:Francisella tularensisID:16669925TITLE:The atypical pneumonias: clinical diagnosis and importance.ABSTRACT:The most common atypical pneumonias are caused by three zoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and three nonzoonotic pathogens, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella. These atypical agents, unlike the typical pathogens, often cause extrapulmonary manifestations. Atypical CAPs are systemic infectious diseases with a pulmonary component and may be differentiated clinically from typical CAPs by the pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement which is characteristic for each atypical CAP. Zoonotic pneumonias may be eliminated from diagnostic consideration with a negative contact history. The commonest clinical problem is to differentiate legionnaire's disease from typical CAP as well as from C. pneumoniae or M. pneumonia infection. Legionella is the most important atypical pathogen in terms of severity. It may be clinically differentiated from typical CAP and other atypical pathogens by the use of a weighted point system of syndromic diagnosis based on the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary features. Because legionnaire's disease often presents as severe CAP, a presumptive diagnosis of Legionella should prompt specific testing and empirical anti-Legionella therapy such as the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's weighted point score system. Most atypical pathogens are difficult or dangerous to isolate and a definitive laboratory diagnosis is usually based on indirect, i.e., direct flourescent antibody (DFA), indirect flourescent antibody (IFA). Atypical CAP is virtually always monomicrobial; increased IFA IgG tests indicate past exposure and not concurrent infection. Anti-Legionella antibiotics include macrolides, doxycycline, rifampin, quinolones, and telithromycin. The drugs with the highest level of anti-Legionella activity are quinolones and telithromycin. Therapy is usually continued for 2 weeks if potent anti-Legionella drugs are used. In adults, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may exacerbate or cause asthma. The importance of the atypical pneumonias is not related to their frequency (approximately 15% of CAPs), but to difficulties in their diagnosis, and their nonresponsiveness to beta-lactam therapy. Because of the potential role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), and the role of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in causing or exacerbating asthma, atypical CAPs also have public health importance."

The three most common zoonotic atypical pathogens are Chlamydophila psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Atypical CAPs are suggested by a distinctive pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. Zoonotic CAP may be differentiated from nonzoonotic CAP (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionnaire's disease) by a recent zoonotic vector contact history. Zoonotic atypical CAP occurs sporadically, but not randomly, and require close association with the appropriate zoonotic vector to transmit the infection. CAP accompanied by the extrapulmonary finding of splenomegaly in a normal host limits differential diagnostic possibilities to Q fever and psittacosis. Splenomegaly does not occur with other typical or atypical CAP. Another common extrapulmonary finding occurs with some atypical pneumonias, that is, Q fever, psittacosis, and Legionnaire's disease is early mild/transient elevations of serum transaminases indicative of (hepatic) extrapulmonary organ involvement. The case presented is a middle-aged man with longstanding Crohn's disease who was further immunosuppressed by chronic prednisone therapy. The patient presented with CAP and extrapulmonary findings, that is, splenomegaly and increased serum transaminases. He denied recent contact with birds or animals. Because Crohn's disease and Q fever CAP may be accompanied by splenomegaly, the cause of his splenomegaly was a diagnostic dilemma. The patient was treated with levofloxacin. Serologic tests for atypical pathogens (Q fever, psittacosis, Legionnaire's disease, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae) were ordered. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology for Q fever was positive with elevated acute immunoglobulin-M (phase II) titers. Re-questioning of the patient revealed a recent exposure to a neighbor's parturient cat, providing the necessary zoonotic vector contact history for Q fever. The patient responded to levofloxacin, which resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms, right lower lobe pneumonia, and splenomegaly. Because a prior abdominal computed tomography scan indicated no splenomegaly and his splenomegaly resolved with antimicrobial therapy, the splenomegaly was related to Q fever CAP."

In the recent years tularemia has become a re-emerging infection in Turkey with epidemics and also sporadic cases. Transmission occurs most often through consumption of contaminated water and food, direct contact with animals and insect/ tick bites. In this study, we evaluated clinical features and laboratory findings of 35 tularemia cases diagnosed during two outbreaks that occurred in two different villages during two different periods in Konya (located in Central Anatolia), Turkey and five sporadic cases. In both outbreaks, first (index) cases were admitted to our outpatient clinic with the complaints of cervical lympadenopathy. After diagnosis of tularemia, an organized team visited the villages to search if more cases existed. For microbiological diagnosis, blood, throat and tonsil swabs and lymph node aspirate specimens were collected from the suspected cases. Diagnostic tests (culture, serology, molecular methods) for tularemia were performed in reference center, Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency. Drinking and potable water samples from those villages were also collected by provincial health authorities. The cases (n= 14) that belonged to the first epidemics were detected in February 2010 and cases (n= 21) of the second epidemics in November- December 2010; five cases were followed as sporadic. The mean age of the 40 patients (25 females, 15 males) was 37.6 (age range: 5-80 years; five of them were pediatric group) years. The most common complaints of patients were cervical mass (90%), sore throat (63%), chills (60%) and fever (58%). The most frequently detected clinical findings were enlarged lymph nodes (n= 34, 85%), followed by tonsillitis (20%), skin lesions (15%) and conjunctivitis (8%). Most of the patients (82.5%) had been misdignosed as acute tonsillitis, suppurative lymphadenitis, tuberculous lymphadenitis and brucellosis, before their admission to our hospital and treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Demographic analysis of the cases revealed that 68% of them lived in the rural area, 75% had rodents at home, 46% used natural water supplies, 53% fed animals, 15% had contact with game animals and 5% had contact with ticks. Clinical samples from the patients were found culture negative for F.tularensis. The diagnosis of the cases was based on the presence of specific F.tularensis antibodies between 1/160-1/1280 titers obtained by microagglutination test. Additionally F.tularensis DNA was demonstrated in three lymph node aspirate samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Water samples were found negative both by culture and PCR assays. However, it was detected that there were problems in the chlorination of water supplies in the two villages where epidemics were seen. All the patients were treated with streptomycin (2 x 1 g, intramuscular, 10 days), and surgical intervention was performed for the patients (n= 12) with extremely large lymph nodes and suppuration. Erythema nodosum developed in two patients following the end of treatment. Death or serious complications such as pneumonia or meningitis were not detected. In conclusion, tularemia should be considered in patients presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy, sore throat, fever and unresponsive to previous treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics. For the management of the disease, healthcare personnel and the community should be educated concerning the risk factors and precautions for tularemia."

We present two adults cases of pulmonary and oropharyngeal tularaemia and review the reported cases since 1991-2013. We also present the fifth case of pulmonary empyema. While cavitary pneumonias are primarily treated with drainage, we illustrate a case of cavitary pneumonia associated with tularaemia successfully treated with oral ciprofloxacin after drainage. Tularaemia should be considered in patients with a perplexing radiographic image, animal exposure and lack of response to conventional empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Even in serious cases of pneumonic tularaemia, fluoroquinolones may provide a suitable alternative to aminoglycosides. "

It is the etiological agent of tularemia, a zoonotic disease found throughout the northern hemisphere. The intentional spread of F. tularensis aerosols would probably lead to severe and often fatal pneumonia cases, but also secondary cases from contaminated animals and environments. We are not ready to face such a situation. No vaccine is currently available. A few antibiotics are active against F. tularensis, but strains resistant to these antibiotics could be used in the context of bioterrorism. We need new therapeutic strategies to fight against category A bioterrorism agents, including development of new drugs inhibiting F. tularensis growth and/or virulence, or enhancing the host response to infection by this pathogen.

A lack of awareness about tularemia can be embarrassing and could result in delayed treatment because of improper diagnosis. The diagnosis of tularemia is difficult, because the infections are rare and the clinical spectrum is broad. As only 1 adult case has been reported in Korea thus far, pediatricians in Korea may be unfamiliar with tularemia. We report our experience with a 14-year-old male adolescent with tularemia who presented with atypical pneumonia and possible infective endocarditis. Although the infectivity and mortality rates for tularemia are very high if left untreated, we did not suspect tularemia in this case until the incidental isolation of F. tularensis. The present case suggests that clinicians in Korea should be more aware of tularemia. This case also suggests that tularemia should be considered in undetermined cases of atypical pneumonia or acute febrile illness without local signs. "

It is affecting a wide range of animals and causes human disease after insect and tick bites, skin contact, ingestion and inhalation. A 66-year-old man presented to our clinic with cavitary pneumonia and distinct pleural effusion. After failure of empiric antibiotic therapy, thoracoscopic assisted decortication and partial excision of the middle lobe were conducted. Conventional culture methods and broad-range bacterial PCR including RipSeqMixed analysis were performed from the excised biopsies. Culture results remained negative but broad-range PCR targeting the first half of the 16S rRNA gene revealed F. tularensis DNA. This result was confirmed by F. tularensis-specific PCR and by serology. The source of infection could not be explored. To conclude, we report the rare clinical picture of a community-acquired pneumonia followed by pleural effusion and empyema due to F. tularensis. Broad range bacterial PCR proved to be a powerful diagnostic tool to detect the etiologic organism. "

It is caused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis. Although the ulceroglandular form of the disease is the more common manifestation of infection, F tularensis is known to cause pneumonia. F tularensis has two predominant subspecies, namely subsp. tularensis (type A) and subsp. holarctica (type B). Type B tularemia is considered to be much less virulent than type A and barely caused lethal disease and pneumonia.We reported a case with a 68-year-old man immune-compromised patient diagnosed with bacteremic pneumonia engendered by type B tularemia with initial presentation of high fever, pneumonia with pleural effusion; the diagnosis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The patient's fever, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were resolved with appropriate antibiotics for tularemia. This case involving severe bacteremic pneumonia in an immune-compromised patient is rare.This case suggests that low virulence F tularensis should be included in the differential diagnoses of bacteremic pneumonia for endemic tularemia.

There should be strong consideration for Tularemia in the differential of any patient with its classic symptoms, diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy with evidence of necrosis, and enlarged adenoids. Ultrasound may demonstrate suppurative lymphadenopathy suggestive of infection, as in the case presented. CT often will demonstrate the extent of lymphadenopathy.

In Finland, Northern Ostrobothnia is an endemic area of tularaemia with occasional seasonal outbreaks. METHODS: In our study, a consecutive series of 58 pneumonic tularaemia cases diagnosed and treated in Oulu University Hospital in 2000-2012 were retrospectively analysed in terms of epidemiology, clinical course, and prognosis. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonic tularaemia showed peaks in cycles of a few years and most cases were diagnosed in late summer or early autumn. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 47% of patients, and 7% had normal chest X-ray. The chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in 81% of patients, demonstrating variable findings associated with pneumonic tularaemia. Bronchoscopy was performed for 22 (38%) patients and four (18%) of these also proceeded into mediastinoscopy. Moreover, thoracoscopy was performed for one (2%) patient. Two (3%) patients were treated shortly in the intensive care unit (ICU) during their stay in hospital. No mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of pneumonic tularaemia are diagnosed during the seasonal outbreaks.

Taking a detailed history of exposure and a highly raised index of clinical suspicion are necessary to take the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic steps in this setting. Here, a case report of typhoid tularaemia is presented. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year old male forester and farmer with protracted fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and loss of weight, who experienced productive cough and a pulmonary infiltrate later in the course of disease, was admitted for further investigation. Tularaemia was suspected only owing to history and confirmed by serologic testing more than three weeks after the beginning of the symptoms. The initial antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone/doxycycline was switched to ciprofloxacin, resulting in the resolution of fever and symptoms. CONCLUSION: Tularaemia has to be considered as a differential diagnosis in febrile patients, even more in cases with protracted fever. Since tularaemia is expanding geographically, involving more animal hosts and causing larger outbreaks, clinicians have to be aware of this potentially fatal disease."

Francisella tularensis, which is a Gram-negative coccobacillus-shaped bacterium, is the causative agent of tularemia. Recently, an increase in the number of human tularemia cases has been noticed in several countries around the world. It has been reported mostly from North America, several Scandinavian countries, and certain Asian countries. The disease spreads through vectors such as mosquitoes, horseflies, deer flies, and ticks. Humans can acquire the disease through direct contact of sick animals, consumption of infected animals, drinking or direct contact of contaminated water, and inhalation of bacteria-loaded aerosols. Low infectious dose, aerosol route of infection, and its ability to induce fatal disease make it a potential agent of biological warfare. Tularemia leads to several clinical forms, such as glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal forms. The disease is diagnosed through the use of culture, serology, or molecular methods. Quinolones, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides are frequently used in the treatment of tularemia. No licensed vaccine is available in the prophylaxis of tularemia and this is need of the time and high-priority research area.

Approximately 200 cases of tularemia are reported in the United States per year, and 10% to 20% present with pneumonia either as a primary event or as a complication of ulceroglandular or typhoidal tularemia. Tularemia pneumonia also occurs with the other tularemic forms, glandular, oculoglandular, and oropharyngeal tularemia as a result of secondary bacteremic spread to the lungs. Pneumonia usually occurs within 2 days to months after infection. The mortality rate of primary tularemic pneumonia and pneumonia complicating typhoidal tularemia is high. The clinical and roentgenographic presentations of tularemia pneumonia are highly variable and is one of the zoonotic atypical pneumonias. Tularemic pneumonia may mimic fungal and bacterial pneumonias, tuberculosis, or malignancy. The diagnosis of tularemic pneumonia should be considered in any patient presenting with an atypical pneumonia with the finding of an ulcer and/or lymphadenopathy and a history of outdoor activity. Serum agglutination tests and ELISA are the basis of serological diagnosis. Francisella tularensis can be cultured from the sputum, skin ulcer, pleural fluid, and the lymph nodes, but cultures should not be obtained because of the danger to laboratory personnel. The drug preferred for treatment of tularemic pneumonia is streptomycin for 1 to 2 weeks."

Three hypotheses were raised: 1--purulent conjunctivitis is associated with BPF; 2--a cluster effect occurs in BPF; 3--respiratory symptoms may be a variation of the clinical picture of the disease. Numerical values were attributed to different findings, as follows: fever = 5; diarrhea and/or vomiting = 1; haemorrhagic findings = 3; thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia = 3; Haemophilus aegyptius positive hemoculture and/or Haemophilus aegyptius positive cerebrospinal fluid culture and/or H. a. oropharynx culture = 7; Waterhouse Friedrichsen syndrome = 7.

Mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. INVESTIGATIONS: Cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. TREATMENT AND COURSE: An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. Only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. At present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for Osler's disease. CONCLUSION: In patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, Osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded.

Haemophilus influenzae and some of the other Haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. New species of Haemophilus have been described (Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus Aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former Haemophilus and Actinobacillus species (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter segnis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). Aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (HACEK endocarditis), and A. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. Correct identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. It has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive H. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of Haemophilus haemolyticus. Due to the limited pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found. Several methods have been investigated for differentiation of H. influenzae from its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. With the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. However, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating DNA sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16S rRNA genes."

We report a 4-year old girl with congenital heart disease, who suffered from 2 IE episodes secondary to Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly Haemophilus aphrophilus) and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, both rarely reported pathogens in this age group. The patient was initially successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses, however removal of the Contegra valved conduit during the second episode was required due to recurrence of fever and development of pulmonary embolism despite completion of antibiotic therapy. A. aphrohilus is a member of the fastidious gram negative microorganisms of the HACEK group (Haemophilus spp., Aggregatibacter spp, Cardiobaterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella kingae), that colonize the oropharynx and are a recognised cause of IE. Prognosis of children with IE due to HACEK group members varies, half of them suffering from complications and mortality rates of 10-12.5%. Although S. lugdunensis belongs to coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS), it behaves more like S. aureus species rather than CONS. This microorganism is a well-described cause of endocarditis in adult patients, associated with high requirements of surgical procedures and mortality (42-78%). In conclusion, paediatric IE can be caused by uncommon microorganisms associated with severe complications and potential fatality. The isolation of S. lugdunensis or A. aphrophilus in febrile patients should be considered clinically relevant and cardiac involvement must be ruled out. Those patients with proved IE will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses and in complicated cases surgical intervention. "

In a prospective study, selected isolates of apparent H. influenzae had an altered phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that these variant strains were genetically different from typical H. influenzae. METHODS: A prospective study of adults with COPD was conducted. Strains of apparent H. influenzae obtained from a range of clinical sources were evaluated by ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, multilocus sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, and sequencing of the conserved P6 gene. RESULTS: Variant strains were determined to be Haemophilus haemolyticus by means of 4 independent methods. Analysis of 490 apparent H. influenzae strains, identified by standard methods, revealed that 39.5% of sputum isolates and 27.3% of nasopharyngeal isolates were H. haemolyticus. Isolates obtained from normally sterile sites were all H. influenzae. In a prospective study, acquisitions of new strains of H. haemolyticus were not associated with exacerbations of COPD, whereas 45% of acquisitions of new strains of H. influenzae were associated with exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Standard methods do not reliably distinguish H. haemolyticus from H. influenzae. H. haemolyticus is a respiratory tract commensal. The recognition that some strains of apparent H. influenzae are H. haemolyticus substantially strengthens the association of true H. influenzae with clinical infection."

Molecular characterisation of phenotypically defined NTHi isolates suggests that up to 40% are Haemophilus haemolyticus (Hh); however, the genetic similarity of NTHi and Hh limits the power of simple molecular techniques such as PCR for species discrimination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we assess the ability of previously published and novel PCR-based assays to identify true NTHi. Sixty phenotypic NTHi isolates, classified by a dual 16S rRNA gene PCR algorithm as NTHi (n = 22), Hh (n = 27) or equivocal (n = 11), were further characterised by sequencing of the 16S rRNA and recA genes then interrogated by PCR-based assays targeting the omp P2, omp P6, lgtC, hpd, 16S rRNA, fucK and iga genes. The sequencing data and PCR results were used to define NTHi for this study. Two hpd real time PCR assays (hpd#1 and hpd#3) and the conventional iga PCR assay were equally efficient at differentiating study-defined NTHi from Hh, each with a receiver operator characteristic curve area of 0.90 [0.83; 0.98]. The hpd#1 and hpd#3 assays were completely specific against a panel of common respiratory bacteria, unlike the iga PCR, and the hpd#3 assay was able to detect below 10 copies per reaction. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest an evolutionary continuum between NTHi and Hh and therefore no single gene target could completely differentiate NTHi from Hh. The hpd#3 real time PCR assay proved to be the superior method for discrimination of NTHi from closely related Haemophilus species with the added potential for quantification of H. influenzae directly from specimens. We suggest the hpd#3 assay would be suitable for routine NTHi surveillance and to assess the impact of antibiotics and vaccines, on H. influenzae carriage rates, carriage density, and disease."

In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy."

","SPECIES:Haemophilus haemolyticusID:24696434TITLE:Classification, identification, and clinical significance of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.ABSTRACT:The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. Haemophilus influenzae and some of the other Haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. New species of Haemophilus have been described (Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus Aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former Haemophilus and Actinobacillus species (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter segnis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). Aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (HACEK endocarditis), and A. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. Correct identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. It has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive H. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of Haemophilus haemolyticus. Due to the limited pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found. Several methods have been investigated for differentiation of H. influenzae from its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. With the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. However, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating DNA sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16S rRNA genes."

This pilot study evaluates whether isolations of H. haemolyticus are frequent enough in Germany to cause a relevant diagnostic problem, considering the fact that even H. influenzae is a mere colonizer in about 30% of isolations. In microbiological laboratories of two hospitals located in Northern and Southern Germany, the distribution of Haemophilus spp. was analyzed during a six-month-period. Site of infection, sex, and age of the patients was taken into consideration. A total of 77 Haemophilus spp. isolates was acquired and discriminated on species level, comprising: 48 H. influenzae, 25 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 H. haemolyticus, and 1 Haemophilus parahaemolyticus. The proportion of H. haemolyticus was calculated to range between 1.2% and 16.2 % within the 95% confidence limits. Commensalic Haemophilus spp. were isolated from oropharynx-associated sites only. H. influenzae, in contrast, was detected in clinically relevant materials like lower respiratory materials and conjunctiva swabs. Altogether, there was a low proportion of clinical H. haemolyticus isolates. Accordingly, the problem of unnecessary antibiotic therapies due to misidentifications of H. haemolyticus as H. influenzae is quantitatively negligible compared with the risk of confusing H. influenzae colonizations with infections.

","SPECIES:Haemophilus haemolyticusID:25883794TITLE:Difficult identification of Haemophilus influenzae, a typical cause of upper respiratory tract infections, in the microbiological diagnostic routine.ABSTRACT:Haemophilus influenzae is a key pathogen of upper respiratory tract infections. Its reliable discrimination from nonpathogenic Haemophilus spp. is necessary because merely colonizing bacteria are frequent at primarily unsterile sites. Due to close phylogenetic relationship, it is not easy to discriminate H. influenzae from the colonizer Haemophilus haemolyticus. The frequency of H. haemolyticus isolations depends on factors like sampling site, patient condition, and geographic region. Biochemical discrimination has been shown to be nonreliable. Multiplex PCR including marker genes like sodC, fucK, and hpd or sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, the P6 gene, or multilocus-sequence-typing is more promising. For the diagnostic routine, such techniques are too expensive and laborious. If available, matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a routine-compatible option and should be used in the first line. However, the used database should contain well-defined reference spectra, and the spectral difference between H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus is small. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization is an option for less well-equipped laboratories, but the available protocol will not lead to conclusive results in all instances. It can be used as a second line approach. Occasional ambiguous results have to be resolved by alternative molecular methods like 16S rRNA gene sequencing. "

METHODS: An updated database was used to differentiate between MALDI-TOF MS results for Haemophilus influenzae and H. haemolyticus. Antimicrobial susceptibility was studied by microdilution, following EUCAST criteria. The beta-lactamase types were identified by PCR analysis of isolates that tested positive for nitrocefin hydrolysis. Mutations in the ftsI gene were identified in isolates with ampicillin MICs &gt;=0.25 mg/L. Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were identified in isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs &gt;=0.5 mg/L. RESULTS: Overall, we identified 69 H. haemolyticus isolates from 1706 clinical isolates of Haemophilus spp. from respiratory, genital, invasive, and other infection sources. The frequency of H. haemolyticus was low in respiratory samples compared with that of H. influenzae, but in genital-related samples, the frequency was similar to that of H. influenzae. We found low antimicrobial resistance rates among H. haemolyticus isolates, with 8.7% for ampicillin, 8.7% for co-trimoxazole, 7.2% for tetracycline and 4.3% for ciprofloxacin. Mutations in the ftsI gene classified the isolates into four groups, including the newly described Group Hhae IV, which presents mutations in the ftsI gene not identified in H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus type strains. Three ciprofloxacin-resistant H. haemolyticus isolates with mutations affecting GyrA and ParC were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of H. haemolyticus was low, especially in respiratory samples, where H. influenzae is the main pathogen of this genus. Although antimicrobial resistance rates were low, three ciprofloxacin-resistant H. haemolyticus clinical isolates have been identified for the first time."

Since the 1970s it has been observed that a non-typeable cryptic genospecies of H. influenzae, most often biotype IV has been associated with the genitourinary tract of females and invasive neonatal infections. This distinct genospecies has been provisionally named ""Haemophilus quentini"". Here we report seven invasive cases of ""H. quentini"" disease in patients from Ontario, Canada over a 2 year period. Significantly, to date while most reports of invasive disease with ""H. quentini"" have been in neonates, we observed 5 cases in adults (3 women of childbearing age, and 2 seniors) as well as 2 in neonates. Identification of ""H. quentini"" is challenging and was not possible by frontline laboratories requiring work at the reference laboratory level. We describe in detail the biochemical, MALDI-Tof MS, PCR results for several targets including16S rRNA gene and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of the seven Ontario ""H. quentini"" isolates and several controls. Our data combined with that of other publications supports the fact that ""H. quentini"" is distinct from H. influenzae and Haemophilus haemolyticus. This organism is recognized as a pathogen of neonates but we hypothesize that it may be under-recognized as an important pathogen in adults as well, particularly pregnant women. By sharing the detailed descriptions of these isolates, we hope to enable other laboratories to better identify ""H. quentini"" so that the true prevalence of this organism and disease can be explored."

According to their age, they were divided into infant group (402 infants aged 28 days to 1 year), young children group (73 children aged 1 to 3 years), preschool children group (35 children aged 3 to 6 years), and school-aged children group (12 children aged &gt;=6 years). According to the onset season, all children were divided into spring group (March to May, 120 children), summer group (June to August, 93 children), autumn group (September to November, 105 children), and winter group (December to February, 204 children). Sputum specimens from the deep airway were collected from all patients. The phoenix-100 automatic bacterial identification system was used for bacterial identification and drug sensitivity test. The direct immunofluorescence assay was used to detect seven common respiratory viruses. The quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). RESULTS: Of all the 522 children with severe CAP, 419 (80.3%) were found to have pathogens, among whom 190 (45.3%) had mixed infection. A total of 681 strains of pathogens were identified, including 371 bacterial strains (54.5%), 259 viral strains (38.0%), 12 fungal strains (1.8%), 15 MP strains (2.2%), and 24 CT strains (3.5%). There were significant differences in the distribution of bacterial, viral, MP, and fungal infections between different age groups (P&lt;0.05). There were significant differences in the incidence rate of viral infection between different season groups (P&lt;0.05), with the highest incidence rate in winter. The drug-resistance rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin reached above 85%, and the drug-resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin were above 50%; they were all sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. The drug-resistance rates of Haemophilus influenzae to cefaclor and cefuroxime were above 60%, but it was sensitive to cefotaxime. The drug-resistance rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to ampicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone were above 60%, but they were sensitive to carbapenems and compound preparation of enzyme inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are the main pathogens in children with severe CAP and mixed infection is prevalent. The drug-resistance rates of these pathogenic bacteria are high."

METHODS: The literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, Web-of Science, and the Chinese databases Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. All CAP etiological studies on children under 5 y of age from China published in Chinese and English between the years of 2001 and 2015 were included. A total of 48 studies were included in the final review, comprising 100 151 hospitalized children with CAP episodes. Heterogeneity and the percentage of variation between studies was analyzed based on Q statistic and I2 indices, respectively. Random effect models were used to calculate the weighted average rate in all analyses. RESULTS: The most frequently detected bacterial agents were Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.2%), Escherichia coli (5.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.9%), Haemophilus influenza (3.6%) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (3.3%). The most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (20.3%, in just 2 studies), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 17.3%), human bocavirus (9.9%), parainfluenza virus (5.8%), human metapneumovirus (3.9%) and influenza (3.5%).

CONCLUSION: This article provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the factors contributing to CAP in children under 5 y of age. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and influenza were the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in children. Corresponding, vaccines should be introduced into Chinese immunization programs, and further economic evaluations should be conducted.

METHODS: A decision tree and the Markov model were used to estimate the costs and effectiveness of the Hib vaccine versus no Hib vaccine for a birth cohort of 100,000 children in 2016. The disease burden was estimated from the literature, statistical yearbooks and field surveys. Vaccine costs were calculated from government reports and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) website. The WHO cost-effectiveness thresholds were used to evaluate the Hib vaccine intervention. A one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate the parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: Within the hypothetical cohort, under a vaccination coverage of 90%, the Hib vaccine could reduce 91.4% of Hib pneumonia and 88.3% of Hib meningitis; the Hib vaccine could also prevent 25 deaths, 24 meningitis sequelae cases and 9 hearing loss cases caused by Hib infection. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the Hib vaccine compared with no vaccination was US$ 13,640.1 at the market price, which was less than 3 times the GDP per capita of China in 2016. The ICER of the Hib vaccine was US$ -59,122.9 at the UNICEF price, indicating a cost savings. The largest portion of the uncertainty in the result was caused by the annual incidence of all-cause pneumonia, proportion of pneumonia caused by Hi, vaccine costs per dose, annual incidence of Hib meningitis and costs per episode of meningitis. The models were robust considering parameter uncertainties. CONCLUSION: The Hib vaccine is a cost-effective intervention among children in mainland China. The cost of Hib vaccine should be reduced, and it should be introduced into Chinese immunization programs."

We have previously shown that chronic colonization of Haemophilus influenzae during stable disease is related to increased inflammation, and we now aimed to relate previous findings of bacterial colonization and inflammation to the degree of radiological findings of bronchiectasis and emphysema. Thirty-nine patients with COPD were included in their stable state, and a high-resolution computed tomography of the lung was performed. They were followed-up monthly for up to a maximum of 6 months or until exacerbation, and they answered questionnaires, performed spirometry, and induced sputum at every visit. Thirty-five patients had emphysema with an emphysema degree of median 20% (interquartile range 10-50), and five patients had bronchiectasis, of which only four could expectorate sputum. The degree of emphysema correlated with several inflammatory mediators in sputum, such as interleukin-8 concentration, myeloperoxidase activity, and Leukotriene B4 concentration. Ten patients were chronically colonized with H. influenzae (ie, had a positive culture for H. influenzae at all visits). The four sputum patients with bronchiectasis were chronically colonized with H. influenzae and showed higher degree of H. influenzae growth compared to patients without bronchiectasis. During exacerbation, there was no longer any correlation between emphysema degree and inflammation, but patients with bronchiectasis showed higher sputum purulence score than patients without bronchiectasis. Emphysema and bronchiectasis in COPD patients show different clinical features. The presence of emphysema is more related to inflammation, while bronchiectasis is associated with bacterial colonization. We believe that both emphysema and bronchiectasis are therefore COPD phenotypes of highest impact and need evaluation to prevent further disease progression."

However, it is often difficult to evaluate acute C. pneumoniae infection using upper respiratory tract specimens and/or sputum samples due to its persistent infection or colonization. The interpretation of frequency of detection of C. pneumoniae seems to be insufficient in community-onset pneumonia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of C. pneumoniae using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. METHODS: BALF samples from 147 patients with pneumonia were retrospectively evaluated using C. pneumoniae-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. RESULTS: None of the samples had positive PCR results for C. pneumoniae using two different sets of specific primers. Single and paired serological analyses were performed in 54 (36.7%) and 37 (25.2%) patients, respectively. These analyses revealed that 1 of 37 (2.7%) patients had a presumptive acute infection with C. pneumoniae, 8 of the 54 (14.8%) patients were suspected of having a C. pneumoniae infection, and 7 of the 37 (18.9%) patients were suspected of having past C. pneumoniae infection. In addition, cultivation and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing detected Haemophilus influenzae in the presumptive case using the serological method.

However, it is difficult to identify pneumococcal infection among children with CAP. We aimed to assess association between any cytokine/chemokine and pneumococcal infection in childhood CAP. Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic value of cytokine/chemokine for pneumococcal infection. This prospective study was conducted at an Emergency Room, in Salvador, Brazil.

Clinical characteristics were similar among participants, regardless of positivity status for any of the bacteria. Approximately 26% of pneumococcal isolates were PCV13 serotypes, and 96% of H. influenzae isolates were non-typeable (NTHi). Concordance between BALF and NPS isolates was 51.0% for S. pneumoniae, 52.1% for H. influenzae, and 22.0% for M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae, NTHi, and M. catarrhalis were the main bacteria detected in BALF and NPS. Children with suspected chronic LRTI may benefit from a vaccine protecting against NTHi. What is Known:   Chronic lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children can cause high morbidity and is a major use of healthcare resources worldwide. Despite this, their etiology or potential preventive measures are poorly assessed.   Bronchoalveolar lavage can be used to determine bacterial etiology of chronic LRTI. What is New:   We used conventional and molecular techniques to show that Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were present in the LRT of Spanish children with suspected chronic LRTI   Concordance between isolates from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs was low, suggesting that samples from the upper respiratory tract could not reliably predict the bacterial etiology of suspected chronic LRTI."

METHODS: In all, 3104 adults with LRTI were enrolled, of whom 141 (4.5%) had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 2985 matched controls in a prospective study in 16 primary care networks in Europe, and followed patients up at 28-35 days. We detected Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and assessed susceptibility, atypical bacteria and viruses. RESULTS: A potential pathogen was detected in 1844 (59%) (in 350 (11%) bacterial pathogens only, in 1190 (38%) viral pathogens only, and in 304 (10%) both bacterial and viral pathogens). The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were S. pneumoniae (5.5% overall, 9.2% in CAP patients) and H. influenzae (5.4% overall, 14.2% in CAP patients). Less than 1% of S. pneumoniae were highly resistant to penicillin and 12.6% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase positive. The most common viral pathogens detected were human rhinovirus (20.1%), influenza viruses (9.9%), and human coronavirus (7.4%). Influenza virus, human parainfluenza viruses and human respiratory syncytial virus as well as human rhinovirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus were detected significantly more frequently in LRTI patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: A bacterial pathogen is identified in approximately one in five adult patients with LRTI in primary care, and a viral pathogen in just under half, with mixed infections in one in ten. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae are uncommon. These new findings support a restrictive approach to antibiotic prescribing for LRTI and the use of first-line, narrow-spectrum agents in primary care."

Introduction of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B and multivalent pneumococcal vaccines in developed countries including Australia has significantly reduced the overall burden of bacterial pneumonia. With the availability of molecular diagnostics, viruses are frequently detected in children with pneumonia either as primary pathogens or predispose to secondary bacterial infection. Many respiratory pathogens that are known to cause pneumonia are also identified in asymptomatic children, so the true contribution of these pathogens to childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. Since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, very few comprehensive studies from developed countries have attempted to determine the bacterial and viral aetiology of pneumonia. We aim to determine the contribution of bacteria and viruses to childhood CAP to inform further development of effective diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a prospective case-control study (PneumoWA) where cases are children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) and controls are healthy children identified from PMH outpatient clinics and from local community immunisation clinics. The case-control ratio is 1:1 with 250 children to be recruited in each arm. Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected from both cases and controls to detect the presence of viruses and bacteria by PCR; pathogen load will be assessed by quantitative PCR. The prevalence of pathogens detected in cases and controls will be compared, the OR of detection and population attributable fraction to CAP for each pathogen will be determined; relationships between pathogen load and disease status and severity will be explored. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the human research ethics committees of PMH, Perth, Australia (PMH HREC REF 2014117EP). Findings will be disseminated at research conferences and in peer-reviewed journals."

The course of the disease can be very rapid, resulting in sudden death. The incidence of Hib-induced epiglottitis in children has declined since the introduction of vaccinations in countries where such vaccinations are routinely administered. We herein present a case involving a 2.5-year-old boy who died suddenly at home. He had developed acute-onset throat and abdominal pain and a high fever. Despite an emergency cricothyrotomy due to a complicated intubation because of a massively swollen epiglottis, the efforts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful. He was a previously healthy toddler, but he had not yet been vaccinated. Microbiologic analysis revealed the pathogenic bacterium Hib. The main autopsy finding was acute epiglottitis with swelling and cherry-red coloring of the epiglottis. Postmortem cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid and heart blood also revealed Hib as the pathogenic agent. Acute pneumonia was also diagnosed microscopically. The present report describes a rare case of Hib-induced acute epiglottitis and presents the key findings of forensic investigations in this type of disease."

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term ""communityacquired pneumonia"". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Patents were searched using the key term ""community-acquired pneumonia"" from www.google.com/patents, http://espacenet.com, and www. freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS: Generally, viruses, notably respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common cause of community- acquired pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause across all age groups. Other important bacterial causes in children younger than 5 years include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In children 5 years or older, in addition to S. pneumoniae, other important bacterial causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. In the majority of cases, bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably distinguished from each other on clinical grounds. In practice, most children with pneumonia are treated empirically with antibiotics; the choice of which depends on the patient's age and most likely pathogen. Recent patents related to the management of community-acquired pneumonia are discussed. CONCLUSION: In previously healthy children under the age of 5 years, high dose amoxicillin is the treatment of choice. For those with type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives. For children with a non-type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cefixime, cefprozil, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime should be considered. In previously healthy children over the age of 5 years, macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are the drugs of choice."

In Scandinavia, benzylpenicillin is the recommended empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) except in very severe cases. However, the effect of benzylpenicillin on H. influenzae infections has been debated. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients given benzylpenicillin with patients given wide-spectrum beta-lactams (WSBL) as empirical treatment of lower respiratory tract H. influenzae infections requiring hospital care. We identified 481 adults hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection by H. influenzae, bacteremic and non-bacteremic. Overall, 30-day mortality was 9% (42/481). Thirty-day mortality, 30-day readmission rates, and early clinical response rates were compared in patients receiving benzylpenicillin (n = 199) and a WSBL (n = 213) as empirical monotherapy. After adjusting for potential confounders, empirical benzylpenicillin treatment was not associated with higher 30-day mortality neither in a multivariate logistic regression (aOR 2.03 for WSBL compared to benzylpenicillin, 95% CI 0.91-4.50, p = 0.082), nor in a propensity score-matched analysis (aOR 2.14, 95% CI 0.93-4.92, p = 0.075). Readmission rates did not significantly differ between the study groups, but early clinical response rates were significantly higher in the WSBL group (aOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.21-4.31, p = 0.011), albeit still high in both groups (84 vs 81%). In conclusion, despite early clinical response rates being slightly lower for benzylpenicillin compared to WSBL, we found no support for increased mortality or readmission rates in patients empirically treated with benzylpenicillin for lower respiratory tract infections by H. influenzae."

Retrospective analysis of 396 children with RMPP in our hospital admitted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016 was performed. Nasal aspirate samples were collected for pathogen detection and clinical data were collected. We analysed clinical characteristics, lung imaging characteristics and pathogenic species among these children. Of the 396 RMPP cases, 107 (27.02%) had co-infection with other pathogen, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most common bacteria of infection and human bocavirus (HBoV), human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus being the most common viruses of infection. Children with co-infection were younger than that with single infection (P = 0.010). Children with both virus and bacteria co-infection had been the youngest (P = 0.040). Children with co-infection had a longer fever process, higher leukocyte count, higher C-reactive protein compared with single infection (P &lt; 0.05). Children with co-infection had a higher percentage of pnemothorax and diffuse large area of inflammation in chest X-ray manifestation compared with children with single infection (P &lt; 0.05).

Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease vaccine trial was designed to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) against several outcomes. We now report results for pneumonia. METHODS: In this nationwide, cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children younger than 19 months received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis vaccines as control in 26 clusters. Infants younger than 7 months at the first vaccination received either 3+1 or 2+1 vaccination schedule, children aged 7-11 months received 2+1, and those 12-18 months of age two-dose schedule. All hospitalizations and outpatient visits to hospital associated with ICD-10 codes compatible with pneumonia were identified through the National Care Register and 1-3 frontal chest X-ray images per event were collected. External readers who were unaware of the patients' vaccination status retrospectively interpreted the images. The evaluated outcomes were hospital-diagnosed, hospital-treated pneumonia as primary diagnosis, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia during the blinded, intention-to-treat follow-up period from the first vaccination to the end of 2011. Total VE was calculated as 1 minus rate ratio of all pneumonia episodes. RESULTS: 47 366 children were enrolled from February 2009, to October 2010. VE against all episodes of hospital-diagnosed pneumonia was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%, 38%), 32% (95% CI: 3%, 52%), and 23% (95% CI: -5%, 44%) in subjects enrolled at age &lt;7, 7-11, and 12-18 months, respectively. Corresponding rate reductions were 3.4, 4.7, and 2.5 per 1000 person-years. VE estimates against pneumonia with alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion (WHO criteria) in the three cohorts were 45% (95% CI: 26%, 60%), 56% (95% CI: 14%, 77%), and 48% (95% CI: 2%, 73%), respectively. CONCLUSION: PHiD-CV10 vaccination remarkably reduced disease burden due to pneumonia in infants and young children.

In 2016, the mortality rate from pneumonia was 16,476 deaths per 100,000, which was an 11% increase from the previous year. The aim of our study was to determine the distribution of the bacterial pathogens causing respiratory symptoms in different age groups over a 10-year period. Between January 2008 and September 2017, 1,861 specimens from 1,664 patients admitted to Dankook University Hospital with respiratory symptoms were examined. We used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect six bacterial pneumonia pathogens: Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We detected bacterial pneumonia pathogens in 1,281 (68.83%) specimens. Of the 1,709 pathogens detected, S. pneumoniae was the most common (48.57%; n = 830) followed by H. influenzae (40.08%; n = 685). Most infections were found among children younger than 10 years (92.69%; n = 1,584). Although S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen detected in all age groups, M. pneumoniae infection increased in prevalence with age (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of co-infection was also high among these patients (31.1%; n = 399), which peaked in 2015 (54.55%; n = 42/77). The prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in Cheonan, along with the proportion of co-infections among patients increased over the 10-year study period.

We enrolled recruits undertaking a 10-week military training at two Royal Thai Army barracks between May 2014 and July 2015. We used a multiplex respiratory panel to analyze nose and throat swabs collected at the start and end of the training period, and from participants experiencing respiratory symptoms during follow-up. Paired sera were tested for influenza seroconversion using a hemagglutinin inhibition assay. Overall rates of upper respiratory illness and influenza-like illness were 3.1 and 2.0 episodes per 100 person-weeks, respectively. A pathogen was detected in 96% of samples. The most commonly detected microbes were Haemophilus influenzae type B (62.7%) or non-type B (58.2%) and rhinovirus (22.4%). At baseline, bacterial colonization was high and included H. influenzae type B (82.3%), H. influenzae non-type B (31.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.5%). At the end of follow-up, colonization with H. influenzae non-type B had increased to 74.1%, and S. pneumoniae to 33.6%. In the serology subset, the rate of influenza infection was 3.4 per 100 person-months; 58% of influenza infections resulted in clinical disease. Our study provides key data on the epidemiology and transmission of respiratory pathogens in tropical settings.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued diagnosis criteria for pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia and for ventilator-associated events in adults. The objectives of this pediatric study were to determine the prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia using these new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, to describe the risk factors and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and to assess a simpler method to detect ventilator-associated pneumonia with ventilator-associated event in critically ill children. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, single-center. SETTING: PICU in a tertiary-care university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive critically ill children mechanically ventilated for greater than or equal to 48 hours between November 2013 and November 2015. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 304 patients mechanically ventilated for greater than or equal to 48 hours, 284 were included. Among them, 30 (10.6%) met clinical and radiologic Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for ventilator-associated pneumonia, yielding an prevalence of 7/1,000 mechanical ventilation days. Median time from mechanical ventilation onset to ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis was 4 days. Semiquantitative culture of tracheal aspirates was the most common microbiological technique. Gram-negative bacteria were found in 60% of patients, with a predominance of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotic therapy complied with adult guidelines. Compared with patients without ventilator-associated pneumonia, those with ventilator-associated pneumonia had significantly longer median durations of mechanical ventilation (15 vs 6 d; p &lt; 0.001) and PICU stay (19 vs 9 d; p &lt; 0.001). By univariate analysis, risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia were younger age, reintubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and continuous enteral feeding. Among the 30 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, 17 met adult ventilator-associated event's criteria (sensitivity, 56%). CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator-associated pneumonia is associated with longer times on mechanical ventilation and in the PICU. Using the ventilator-associated event criteria is of interest to rapidly screen for ventilator-associated pneumonia in children. However, sensitivity must be improved by adapting these criteria to children."

The primary aim of the present study was to assess whether current guidelines are followed. A secondary aim was to assess if tracheal aspiration is a useful tool in the diagnostic process of suspected childhood pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive single-centre cohort study. Children between three months and 17 years with a pneumonia diagnosis were included. The children were divided into two groups based on whether or not they had been treated with antibiotics (TWA) by their general practitioner. We obtained information on blood samples, treatment and microbial findings. Finally, we compared the use of antibiotics and the microbiological diagnosis of children TWA prior to admittance with those of drug-naive children (DN). RESULTS: Guidelines were followed in 55% (n = 78) of the cases, which is comparable to results reported by other studies. Tracheal aspiration culture identified a bacterial pathogen in 54% (n = 77) of the cases; Haemophilus influenzae was the most prevalent. A larger percentage of tracheal aspirations was positive in the TWA group than in the DN group (66%; n = 31 versus 48%; n = 46).

However, the distribution of the etiology of CAP varies from one country to another, with limited data from rural areas. METHODS: A prospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Leyte, Central Philippines from May 2010 to May 2012. Blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal samples obtained from patients were used to identify pathogens using standard microbiological culture methods and PCR.

The detection rate was higher for bacteria (40%) than viruses (13%). Haemophilus influenzae (12%) was the most commonly detected bacterium and influenza virus (5%) was the most commonly detected virus. The proportion of CAP patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was higher in the younger age group than in the older age group. Among CAP patients, 14% died during hospitalization, and drowsiness on admission and SpO2 &lt;90% were independent risk factors for mortality.

Our aim was to describe the bacterial microbiota of CAP and relate these to clinical characteristics in order to inform future trials of treatment stratified by co-morbidity. CAP patients were prospectively recruited at two UK hospitals. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the dominant bacteria in sputum and compositional data analysis to determine associations with patient characteristics. We analysed sputum samples from 77 patients and found a Streptococcus sp. and a Haemophilus sp. were the most relatively abundant pathogens. The Haemophilus sp. was more likely to be dominant in patients with pre-existing lung disease, and its relative abundance was associated with qPCR levels of Haemophilus influenzae. The most abundant Streptococcus sp. was associated with qPCR levels of Streptococcus pneumoniae but dominance could not be predicted from clinical characteristics. These data suggest chronic lung disease influences the microbiota of sputum in patients with CAP. This finding could inform a trial of stratifying empirical CAP antibiotics to target Haemophilus spp. in addition to Streptococcus spp. in those with chronic lung disease."

We investigated the effectiveness of at least one dose of the ten-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10; GSK) against respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children under two years of age. METHODS: 424 children enrolled in a cluster-randomized, double-blind Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) vaccine trial during the years 2009-2010 were actively followed in a prospective cohort study (STEPS study) for RTIs from birth to two years of age. Children received the PHiD-CV10 vaccine, or a control vaccine (hepatitis A or B vaccine) according to an age-specific schedule. Data on RTIs were collected by symptom diaries, clinic visits, an electronic registry on hospitalizations, and by nasal swab samples analyzed for respiratory viruses. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness against all RTI episodes and RTI episodes with or without AOM by comparing the corresponding incidence rates between PHiD-CV10 vaccinated and control children, adjusted for presence of siblings and cluster as a random effect. RESULTS: A total of 3193 RTI episodes were documented after the first vaccination in 368 children with all data available. The majority of the illnesses were upper RTIs caused by rhinovirus. The PHiD-CV10-vaccinated children had lower mean annual rates of all RTI episodes (6.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-6.8) and RTI episodes with AOM (1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) as compared to the control children (7.4; 95% CI, 6.8-8.0 and 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6, respectively). The vaccine effectiveness was 12% (95% CI, 2-22%) against all RTIs, 23% (95% CI, 0-40%) against RTIs with AOM, and 10% (95% CI, 0-19%) against RTIs without AOM.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the usefulness of sputum Gram stain for defining the etiologic diagnosis of CAP in adult patients. METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline, Embase, Science Direct, Scopus and LILACS databases for full-text articles. Relevant studies were reviewed by at least three investigators who extracted the data, pooled them using a random effects model, and carried out quality assessment. For each bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli), pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were reported. RESULTS: After a review of 3539 abstracts, 20 articles were included in the present meta-analysis. The studies included yielded 5619 patients with CAP.

This study retrospectively investigated vaccination-related details and postmortem findings for 57 cases of sudden death in children 2 years or younger. Data were extracted from autopsy files at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine. Vaccination histories were available in 50 cases based on the maternity passbook. Of the 32 cases in which any vaccines were administered, 7 infants (21.9%) had received immunization within 7 days of death. The most frequent vaccine cited as the last immunization before death was Haemophilus influenzae B. Although a temporal association of vaccines with sudden death was present for two 3-month-old and one 14-month-old infants in whom death occurred within 3 days of receiving the H. influenzae type b and other vaccinations, a definitive relationship between the vaccine and death could not be identified. Histopathological examinations revealed pneumonia and upper respiratory infection as contributing to death in their cases. Moreover, all 3 cases showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen and lymph nodes, which are similar features to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Judgment of the disorders as truly related to vaccination is difficult, but suspicious cases do exist. Forensic pathologists must devote more attention to vaccination in sudden infant death cases."

Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41 8% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99 7% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31 7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10 6-97 3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6 4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3 2%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33 9%] of 56). Almost all cases (98 9%) and controls (98 0%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61 4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 57 3-65 6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27 3% (23 3-31 6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5 9% (3 9-8 3). Viruses were less common (54 5%, 95% CrI 47 4-61 5 vs 68 0%, 62 7-72 7) and bacteria more common (33 7%, 27 2-40 8 vs 22 8%, 18 3-27 6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31 1%, 95% CrI 28 4-34 2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus-enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes. FUNDING: Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation."

Methods: The clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and treatment outcomes of 84 children with HI infection confirmed by bacterial culture in 7 tertiary children's hospitals from 2014 to 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Among the 84 cases, 50 were males. The age was 1.54 years (ranged from 5 days to 13 years).Twenty cases (24%) had underlying diseases and 48 cases (57%) had not received antibiotics before collecting specimens. Eighty-two cases (98%) had fever and 75 cases (89%) had clear infection foci, among which 31 cases (37%) had meningitis and 27 cases (32%) had pneumonia. Blood culture was positive in 62 cases (74%), cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive in 10 cases (12%), blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid culture were both positive in 11 cases (13%). Antibiotics susceptibility test showed that 27% (22/82) of all HI strains produced beta-lactamases and 48% (37/77) strains were resistant to ampicillin. The drug resistance rates to cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were 25% (20/80) , 20% (9/45) , 71% (44/62) and 19%(11/58), respectively. All strains were sensitive to meropenem, levofloxacin and ceftriaxone. After sensitive antibiotic therapy, 83% (70/84) of all patients were cured and improved, the mortality rate and loss of follow-up rate were 13% (11/84) and 4% (3/84) respectively. Conclusions: Meningitis and pneumonia are common presentation of invasive HI infections in children. Mortality in HI meningitis children is high and the third generation of cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone can be used as the first choice for the treatment of invasive HI infection."

","SPECIES:Haemophilus influenzaeID:31404620TITLE:Ceftaroline fosamil as a potential treatment option for Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia in adults.ABSTRACT:Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is an important aetiological cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Empiric therapy for CAP frequently consists of beta-lactam monotherapy or beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. However, such agents are often ineffective against S. aureus and do not reflect the emergence and increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community setting. Ceftaroline fosamil is a fifth-generation parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive pathogens - such as S. aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes - and typical Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The approval of ceftaroline fosamil in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe CAP was based on two phase 3 trials (FOCUS 1 and 2), which demonstrated that ceftaroline fosamil was non-inferior to ceftriaxone, a standard empiric treatment for CAP, while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. Although head-to-head trials of ceftaroline fosamil versus comparators against MRSA CAP are lacking, the effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in subpopulations of patients not covered by phase 3 trials (e.g. those with MRSA CAP or severe renal impairment) has been demonstrated in the Clinical Assessment Program and Teflaro Utilization Registry (CAPTURE) study. As ineffective empiric therapy is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality and increased costs, ceftaroline fosamil, with its extended spectrum of activity, is an attractive alternative to standard antibiotic CAP regimens."

DESIGN: Review of published English literature between 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include young age, malnutrition, immunosuppression, tobacco smoke or air pollution exposure. Better methods for specimen collection and molecular diagnostics have improved microbiological diagnosis, indicating that pneumonia results from several organisms interacting. Induced sputum increases microbiologic yield for Bordetella pertussis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has been associated with pneumonia in high TB prevalence areas. The proportion of cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b has declined with new conjugate vaccines; Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae non-type b are the commonest bacterial pathogens; viruses are the most common pathogens. Effective interventions comprise antibiotics, oxygen and non-invasive ventilation. New vaccines have reduced severity and incidence of disease, but disparities exist in uptake. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia has decreased but a considerable preventable burden remains. Widespread implementation of available, effective interventions and development of novel strategies are needed."

We combined time series analysis of seasonality, climate-region, and clinical syndromes from 243,000 verbal autopsies in the nationally-representative Million Death Study. Pneumonia mortality at 1 month-14 years was greatest in January (Rate ratio (RR) 1.66, 99%CI 1.51-1.82; versus the April minimum). Higher RRs at 1-11 months suggested respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) etiology. India's humid subtropical region experienced a unique summer pneumonia mortality. Diarrhea mortality peaked in July (RR 1.66, 1.48-1.85) and January (RR 1.37, 1.23-1.48), while deaths with fever and bloody diarrhea (indicating enteroinvasive bacterial etiology) showed little seasonality. Combining mortality at ages 1-59-months in 2015 with prevalence surveys, we estimate 40,600 pneumonia deaths from Streptococcus pneumoniae, 20,700 from RSV, 12,600 from influenza, and 7,200 from Haemophilus influenzae type b and 24,700 diarrheal deaths from rotavirus. Careful mortality studies can elucidate etiologies and inform vaccine introduction."

In January 2017, Poland introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into their national immunisation programme to protect children against invasive pneumococcal disease. This study was designed to investigate pneumonia-related hospitalisation rates and trends from 2009 to 2016 prior to the introduction of nationally funded PCV vaccination. METHODS: Using national public statistic data available from the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene, annual hospitalisation rates for pneumonia were analysed, categorised by aetiology and age (<2, 2-3, 4-5, 6-19, 20-59, 60+ years). Trends over time were assessed, as well as in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The overall hospitalisation rate due to pneumonia varied between 325.9 and 372.2/100,000 population. Higher rates of hospitalisation were seen in older adults and children <=5 years. Trends were observed when analysing hospitalisations by pneumonia aetiology within age groups: between 2009 and 2016, Streptococcus pneumoniae hospitalisations significantly increased for children aged <2, 2-3, and 4-5 years, from 5.3 to 12.4, 5.2 to 8.2, and 1.9 to 4.6/100,000 population respectively. Whereas hospitalisations due to Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia decreased significantly from 7.8 to 1.8 and 4.8 to 1.9/100,000 children aged <2 and 2-3 years respectively. The numbers of in-hospital deaths increased from 5578 in 2009 to 8149 in 2016, with >85% of deaths in the 60+ age group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first national study of pneumonia hospitalisations in Poland, providing the baseline data from which to investigate the impact of the change in vaccination policy on pneumonia hospitalisations in Poland."

We describe the clinical features and molecular epidemiology of invasive Hia disease in children in Utah over an 11-year period. METHODS: We identified cases of invasive Hia disease, defined as detection of Hia from a normally sterile site, in children aged &lt;18 years from Utah between 2007 and 2017. Medical records were reviewed to determine demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes. Available Hia isolates were genotyped using multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic division was determined using sodC polymerase chain reaction. Presence of the putative virulence-associated IS1016-bexA duplication-deletion was evaluated. RESULTS: We identified 51 children with invasive Hia. The average annual incidence was 1.7 cases per 100 000 children aged &lt;5 years; 4.8 cases per 100 000 children aged &lt;1 year. The median age was 11.3 months. The most common clinical presentation was meningitis (53%), followed by pneumonia (14%) and septic arthritis (14%). Twenty-two children (43%) required admission to an intensive care unit; 1 died. Sequence type (ST) 62, phylogenetic division II isolates caused 75% (21/28) of disease. No isolates contained the virulence-associated IS1016-bexA duplication-deletion. CONCLUSIONS: Hia is a significant cause of severe invasive bacterial infection in Utah. The majority of infections were caused by ST62 isolates, a phylogenetic division II Hia type that lacks the IS1016-bexA duplication-deletion. Hia ST62 has not been commonly reported elsewhere, suggesting a unique molecular epidemiology in our population."

METHODS: Between January and December 2017, children aged 2-59 months with chest radiography-confirmed CAP were enrolled. The parents were interviewed to collect information on the patients and home-based medication. Clinical information was derived from the patient files. Nasopharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected for isolation of the causative pathogens. Swab samples were analysed by quantitative PCR whereas blood samples were tested using BacT/Alert 3D. RESULTS: Overall, 109 children with CAP were included in this analysis. Provision of care to most children was delayed (median = 4.6 days). A quarter (26.6%) were given unprescribed/leftover antibiotics at home. Only one child had positive bacterial culture. Referrals were associated with nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (p = 0.003) and Haemophilus influenzae (p = 0.004). Of all admitted children, more than a quarter (n = 29) did not need to be hospitalised and inappropriately received injectable instead of oral antibiotics.

Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris. However, the optimal dosage of rituximab for the treatment of this autoimmune bullous disease has not been clearly defined.The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of an ultra-low dosage regimen of rituximab for pemphigus vulgaris.Methods We performed a prospective non randomized open case series including 8 patients affected by pemphigus vulgaris. Patients were treated with an ultra-low dosage of rituximab (a single infusion of 200 mg).Results All patients had a positive response after infusion. At the end of the follow-up period, 5 patients achieved a complete remission and 3 a partial remission. Except for one case of sepsis due to Citrobacer freundii and a pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae, no adverse events were documented in our patients.Conclusions Data from our study suggest that an ultra-low dosage of rituximab could be an effective treatment for pemphigus vulgaris.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the a) aetiology, b) factors associated with bacterial pneumonia and c) association between co-infections (bacteria + virus) and severity of disease, in children admitted with severe pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study involving children aged 1-month to 5-years admitted with very severe pneumonia, as per the WHO definition, over 2 years. Induced sputum and blood obtained within 24 hrs of admission were examined via PCR, immunofluorescence and culture to detect 17 bacteria/viruses. A designated radiologist read the chest radiographs. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with a mean (SD) age of 14 (+-15) months old were recruited. Significant pathogens were detected in 62% of patients (n = 186). Viruses alone were detected in 23.7% (n = 71) with rhinovirus (31%), human metapneumovirus (HMP) [22.5%] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16.9%] being the commonest. Bacteria alone was detected in 25% (n = 75) with Haemophilus influenzae (29.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (24%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.7%) being the commonest. Co-infections were seen in 13.3% (n = 40) of patients. Male gender (AdjOR 1.84 [95% CI 1.10, 3.05]) and presence of crepitations (AdjOR 2.27 [95% CI 1.12, 4.60]) were associated with bacterial infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) [p = 0.007]) was significantly higher in patients with co-infections but duration of hospitalization (p = 0.77) and requirement for supplemental respiratory support (p = 0.26) were not associated with co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria remain an important cause of very severe pneumonia in developing countries with one in four children admitted isolating bacteria alone.

However, few large-scale studies of its etiology have been conducted in Asia. This study aimed to determine the etiology and clinical features of bronchiectasis in Taiwan. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study investigated the etiology and clinical features of newly diagnosed non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients from January 2002 to December 2016. The clinical, functional and microbiological data of patients were retrieved from the Chang Gung Research Database, which includes seven medical facilities throughout Taiwan. The index date was the date of the first bronchiectasis diagnosis. Known diseases that were diagnosed before the index date were regarded as etiologies of bronchiectasis. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 15,729 adult patients with bronchiectasis. Idiopathic (32%) was the most common cause, followed by post-pneumonia (24%). Other causes included post-tuberculosis (12%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14%), asthma (10%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (2%) and rheumatic diseases (2%). At diagnosis, 8487 patients had sputum culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.3%) was the most common bacteria, followed by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (3.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.1%), but 6155 (72.1%) had negative sputum cultures. Patients with post-tuberculosis had a higher sputum isolation rate of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria than P. aeruginosa. Patients with post-tuberculosis and post-pneumonia bronchiectasis had a higher frequency of chronic lung infection than other groups (p &lt; 0.05). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, lung function, comorbidities and microbiology, were significantly different between idiopathic and known etiologies.

Pneumococci are also one of the main bacterial pathogens associated with acute otitis media (AOM). Infant immunization programs with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have led to stark reductions in pneumococcal disease rates.Areas covered: We summarized the development of the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and evidence of its protective effect in children, since its licensure one decade ago. We highlighted the most recent data from post-licensure studies on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia and AOM and from health economic evaluations. We present results from a model estimating PHiD-CV's impact on pneumococcal-related deaths.Expert opinion: Recent data from post-licensure studies confirm the previously demonstrated positive impact of PHiD-CV on IPD, pneumonia, AOM and AOM-related interventions (e.g., antibiotic use). Despite the success of infant PHiD-CV (and other PCV) programs, pneumococcal diseases still pose a substantial public health burden. Further reducing this burden will require improving access to currently available PCVs, increasing vaccination coverage and addressing the remaining burden due to non-vaccine serotypes. Future availability of lower-cost PCVs, PCVs with a broader serotype coverage and serotype-independent vaccines may contribute to this."

Serotype b (Hib) was very frequent before the introduction of the vaccine, which was introduced in Paraguay in 2004. METHODS: A total of 523 isolates of H. influenzae obtained from 1999 to 2017 and referred to the National Reference Laboratory in Paraguay were studied by conventional microbiological methods and molecular techniques. RESULTS: The most frequent serotype was non-typeable (HiNT) (51.8%; 271/523), followed by Hib (43%; 225/523), Hia and Hif (1.5%; 8/523, respectively), Hic (1%; 5/523), Hie (0.8%; 4/523), and Hid (0.4%; 2/523). A total of 48.4% invasive infections were caused by HiNT, and 46.1% by Hib; 88.6% of isolates corresponded to meningitis, 70.8% to sepsis and 50.9% to pneumonia in children under 5 years. A total of 84% (181/217) of isolates corresponded to invasive infections caused by Hib in children under 5 years, with the highest proportion observed between 2001 and 2003. The most prevalent biotypes were biotype I (29%), biotype II (12%), biotype III (24%), and biotype IV (13%). Among the total of isolates, 13% (68/523) of isolates were resistant to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: After the introduction of the Hib vaccine in Paraguay, the number of invasive Hib cases decreased in children under 5 years old, although we observed an increase of HiNT in children over 5 years.

In 2008, the vaccine was changed from one with natural conjugated capsular polysaccharide to one with a synthetic polysaccharide component. We describe the frequency and characteristics of invasive Hib infections in children hospitalized in a Pediatric Reference Hospital (PRH) between January 1st, 2000 and December 31st, 2017. Methods: Sterile site Hib isolations from hospitalized children were included. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were analyzed. Favorable conditions for the infection were considered: incomplete immunization, immunodeficiencies and associated pathologies. Two periods are described: 1, prior to vaccine change (1/1 st/2000- 12/31/08) and 2, post-change (1/1 st/09- 12/31st/17). Results: 45 children were hospitalized: 5 in the first period and 40 in the second.

Bacterial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional methods. This study assessed the clinical factors influencing bacterial mPCR results in patients with COP. Patients with COP admitted to a tertiary care hospital between November 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively assessed. Conventional methods included culture-based methods and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial mPCR that could identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia was performed. Bacterial mPCR was performed in a total of 342 patients with COP in the study. Bacterial mPCR alone provided etiology in 99 patients. The total etiologic diagnosis rates improved from 22.2 to 51.1% when bacterial mPCR was added to conventional methods. Additional diagnostic benefits of bacterial mPCR were more prominent in the prior antibiotic non-exposure group (77.8% vs 63.5%, P = 0.015) and in the low-risk group with low CURB 65 score (62.6% vs 44.9%, P = 0.005). Patients who required ICU care, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and patients with any underlying diseases were not associated with the additional pathogen detection rates using bacterial mPCR. By supplementing conventional diagnostic methods with bacterial mPCR-based methods, the overall pathogen detection rates improved in patients with COP. Moreover, the additional diagnostic usefulness of bacterial mPCR was significantly higher in patients without prior antibiotic exposure and in the mild-to-moderate-risk group with lower CURB 65 score."

As a measure to control the burden of IBD, the Government of India introduced Pneumoccocal Conjugate Vaccine-13 (PCV-13) in the Universal Immunization Program in high burden districts of five states in a phased manner from 2017 onwards. It is essential to understand the trend of circulating pneumococcal serotypes associated with IBD in the prevaccination and postvaccination scenarios to decide on the expansion of vaccination programmes and PCV reformulation. This manuscript describes the protocol for hospital-based sentinel surveillance for S. pneumoniae and other organisms causing IBD across various geographical regions in India. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Hospital-based surveillance is established in selected hospitals to recruit children aged 1-59 months with symptoms of pneumonia and other IBD. Diagnostic criteria were adapted from standard WHO case definitions. Case Report Forms (CRFs) are used to collect data from the enrolled children. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other normally sterile body fluids are collected and subjected to microscopy, cytology, latex agglutination, biochemistry, bacteriological culture and real-time PCR as applicable. Pneumococcal isolates are serotyped and tested for assessing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Data will be analysed by simple descriptive statistics to estimate the proportion of pneumonia and other IBD due to S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis. Prevalence of bacterial infection, circulating pneumococcal serotypes, antibiotic resistance patterns, serotype variability across seasons and regions will be described in terms of percentage with 95% confidence interval. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The institutional review boards of the coordinating centre, all sentinel sites, regional and national reference laboratories approved the project. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with stakeholders for deciding on revising vaccination strategy appropriately."

However, seasonal variation as a risk factor for the development of postoperative pneumonia remains to be investigated. We sought to investigate whether patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during ""flu season"" (Fall and Winter months) at increased risk of postoperative pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing CABG in the National Inpatient Sample between 2005 and 2015 was completed. Concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were defined to include pneumonia secondary to several known pathogens. Outcomes with significant differences between Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer groups were further analyzed with additive time series decomposition. Odds ratios were generated and adjusted for age, sex, elective status, and 29 other Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comorbidity measures. RESULTS: A total of 238 757 and 277 941 patients undergoing CABG during Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer, respectively, were identified. A significantly increased risk of postoperative pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.15) and infection with influenza (aOR = 4.08), Haemophilus influenzae (aOR = 1.40), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (aOR = 1.47) was observed among patients receiving CABG in Q1 (January-March) compared to Q3 (July-September). CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong seasonality in the incidence of postoperative pneumonia after CABG which may persist across other cardiothoracic surgeries. In addition to optimizing infection control and perioperative care, cardiac surgeons should consider preoperative vaccination against seasonal influenza, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae to improve outcomes among high-risk patients."

There have been few studies about SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with other pathogens. In this retrospective study, 257 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu Province were enrolled from January 22 to February 2, 2020. They were re-confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and tested for 39 respiratory pathogens. In total, 24 respiratory pathogens were found among the patients, and 242 (94.2 %) patients were co-infected with one or more pathogens. Bacterial co-infections were dominant in all COVID-19 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The highest and lowest rates of co-infections were found in patients aged 15-44 and below 15, respectively. Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease. In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases. These results will provide a helpful reference for diagnosis and clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients."

We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, LILACS and CINAHL for eligible studies published from 1 January 2020 to 17 April 2020. We included patients of all ages, in all settings. The main outcome was the proportion of patients with a bacterial, fungal or viral co-infection. . RESULTS: Thirty studies including 3834 patients were included. Overall, 7% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a bacterial co-infection (95% CI 3-12%, n=2183, I2=92 2%). A higher proportion of ICU patients had bacterial co-infections than patients in mixed ward/ICU settings (14%, 95% CI 5-26, I2=74 7% versus 4%, 95% CI 1-9, I2= 91 7%). The commonest bacteria were Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. The pooled proportion with a viral co-infection was 3% (95% CI 1-6, n=1014, I2=62 3%), with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and influenza A the commonest. Three studies reported fungal co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: A low proportion of COVID-19 patients have a bacterial co-infection; less than in previous influenza pandemics. These findings do not support the routine use of antibiotics in the management of confirmed COVID-19 infection."

Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children's Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study assessed the prevalence of common respiratory viruses and bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of among infants and children aged 1 month to 5 years hospitalized with radiologically confirmed CAP between April 2017 and March 2018. Direct immunofluorescence assay and bacterial culture were used to identify viruses and bacteria in the upper airway specimens, respectively. The association between severe CAP and the presence of pathogens was determined using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 685 patients enrolled, 583 cases had viral and/or bacterial pathogens detected, which included the presence of only viral pathogens, only bacterial pathogens and mixed viral and bacterial pathogens in 34.3%, 29.7% and 36.0% of cases, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common viral pathogen, with a prevalence rate of 39.9% (273/685). Haemophilus influenzae was the most commonly detected bacterial pathogen, with a prevalence rate of 15.3% (105/685). The presence of RSV (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.8) and Staphylococcus aureus (aOR 13.7; 95% CI 5.5-33.9) in children with CAP was associated with severe pneumonia.

Clinical features and aetiologies were analysed. Aetiological analyses in sub-cohorts of age, seasons and years were also investigated.Results: 96.0% (1121) of the patients were less than 12 months old. 59.0% (689) of the patients were male. The Top 5 pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n = 125; 10.7%), Streptococcus pneumonia (SP; n = 109; 9.3%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB; n = 86; 7.4%), Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis; n = 84; 7.2%), and Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP; n = 80; 6.9%), respectively. The percentage of SP in the age group of 0-3 months was significantly lower than that in other age groups. The percentage of B. pertussis in the age group of 3-6 months was significantly lower than that in the group of 6-12 months. The percentage of MP in 0-3 months' group was significantly lower than that in >12 months group. RSV peaked in winter (n = 52), while HIB peaked in spring (n = 38).Conclusion: PLS occurred most often in infants. RSV, SP, HIB, B. pertussis, and MP were the most prevalent pathogens. Since patients with B. pertussis and other pathogens have similar clinical manifestations, diagnosis of pertussis should be based on both clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmation."

The clinical evaluation of CAP among patients with cancers remains unknown. Patients and Methods: This retrospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Tang Du Hospital, China, from September 2018 to August 2019. The demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between CAP patients with and without cancers. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with CAP patients with and without cancers. Results: Data from 149 CAP patients with cancers and 268 CAP patients without cancers were analyzed. Patients without cancers were more likely to show fever, cough and yellow sputum, higher level of neutrophil count than the cancer patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae 14.77% vs 9.33%, p = 0.093) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae 16.11% vs 11.57%, p = 0.189) were among the most commonly encountered pathogens in both the groups. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. pneumoniae 26.50% vs 11.41%, p < 0.001), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae 8.21% vs 1.34%, p = 0.003), and filamentous fungi (10.82% vs 4.7%, p = 0.033) were predominant in CAP patients without cancers. Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae 22.15% vs 14.18%, p = 0.038) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococci (MRS 23.49 vs 15.68, p = 0.049) were more prevalent for CAP cancer patients. Certain pathogens were increasing in a cold season. In patients without cancers, MRS, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease, connective tissue disease, bronchiectasis, respectively. In addition, healthy adults were likely to be infected with M. pneumoniae showing fever. Conclusion: CAP patients with cancers had atypical clinical manifestations and showed no distinct increase in inflammatory markers. The predominant pathogens differed as well as similar between the CAP patients with and without cancers. Certain pathogens follow a seasonal pattern. CNS disease, connective tissue disease and bronchiectasis were associated with the predominant pathogens in patients without cancers."

METHODS: We evaluated the use of DBS for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae detection among children in Mozambique. Blood for DBS and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from children with pneumonia and healthy aged < 5 years. Bacterial detection and serotyping were performed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (NP and DBS; lytA gene for pneumococcus and hpd for H. influenzae) and culture (NP). Combined detection rates were compared between children with pneumonia and healthy. RESULTS: Of 325 children enrolled, 205 had pneumonia and 120 were healthy. Pneumococci were detected in DBS from 20.5 and 64.2% of children with pneumonia and healthy, respectively; NP specimens were positive for pneumococcus in 80.0 and 80.8%, respectively. H. influenzae was detected in DBS from 22.9% of children with pneumonia and 59.2% of healthy; 81.4 and 81.5% of NP specimens were positive for H. influenzae, respectively. CONCLUSION: DBS detected pneumococcal and H. influenzae DNA in children with pneumonia and healthy. Healthy children were often DBS positive for both bacteria, suggesting that qPCR of DBS specimens does not differentiate disease from colonization and is therefore not a useful diagnostic tool for children."

Few data exist regarding the effect of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) on the burden of childhood pneumonia in African settings. METHODS: We collected data on children 1 to 59 months of age at three hospitals in Botswana. Hib vaccine and PCV-13 were introduced in Botswana in November 2010 and July 2012, respectively. We compared pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths pre-vaccine (January 2009 to October 2010) to post-vaccine (January 2013 to December 2017) using seasonally-adjusted interrupted time-series analyses. FINDINGS: We identified 6943 pneumonia hospitalizations and 201 pneumonia deaths. In the pre-vaccine period, pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths increased by 24% (rate: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.64) and 59% (rate: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.87, 2.90) per year, respectively. Vaccine introduction was associated with a 48% (95% CI: 29%, 62%) decrease in the number of pneumonia hospitalizations and a 50% (95% CI: 1%, 75%) decrease in the number of pneumonia deaths between the end of the pre-vaccine period (October 2010) and the beginning of the post-vaccine period (January 2013). During the post-vaccine period, pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths declined by 6% (rate 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.99) and 22% (rate: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.92) per year, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths among children declined sharply following introduction of Hib vaccine and PCV-13 in Botswana. This effect was sustained for more than five years after vaccine introduction, supporting the long-term effectiveness of these vaccines in preventing childhood pneumonia in Botswana."

The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for mortality in this patient population. METHODS: This study evaluated the medical records of 113 hospitalized children with severe CAP, who were transferred to the PICU within 48 h of admission at the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center between 2013 and 2017. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 87 boys (77%) and 26 girls (33%), aged between 1 month and 9 years; 72.6% (82/113) of patients were aged <12 months. The mortality rate was 12.3% (14/113). The most common viral and bacterial pathogens isolated were adenovirus (17.7%, 20/113) and Haemophilus influenzae (8.8%, 10/113). Wheezing, cyanosis, oxygen saturation <90%, Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) >3 on admission, not receiving corticosteroid therapy prior to admission, the need for mechanical ventilation, septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction (MODS), and acute renal failure (ARF) occurring prior to transfer to the PICU, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, and decreased hemoglobin and albumin (ALB) levels were associated with mortality (P < 0.05). Non-survivors were more likely to have an oxygen saturation <90% on admission and lower levels of ALB prior to transfer to the PICU than survivors (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that hospitalized children with severe CAP who were transferred to the PICU within 48 h of hospital admission were mainly aged <1 year.

PIV infection in HIV-infected adults has rarely been reported. We report a case of PIV pneumonia in an adult with AIDS who was successfully treated with oral ribavirin. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old man with history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath that began 3 days before. He was in respiratory distress and required mechanical ventilation on arrival. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture was positive for Hemophilus influenzae and a respiratory viral panel was positive for Parainfluenza virus. The patient was initially started on Cefepime and Trimethoprim- Sulfamethoxazole and later changed to Ceftriaxone based on culture results. As the patient's condition did not improve after 48 h, oral ribavirin was added to treat PIV. The patient subsequently improved and was extubated after 72 h. CONCLUSIONS Oral ribavirin can have a beneficial effect in AIDS patients who have PIV-associated pneumonia. Further investigation of the benefit of oral ribavirin in similar cases is warranted."

We described clinical characteristics and adverse clinical outcomes of U.S. invasive Hia cases detected through multi-state surveillance during 2011-2015. METHODS: Medical record data were abstracted for cases reported in eight jurisdictions conducting active population- and laboratory-based surveillance for invasive Hia disease across the United States. Isolates from sterile sites were serotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Adverse clinical outcomes were defined as any possible complication of meningitis, bacteremic pneumonia, or bacteremia (including hearing loss, developmental delay, and speech delay, but excluding death), and were assessed at hospital discharge and one-year post-disease onset. RESULTS: During 2011-2015, 190 Hia cases were reported to the eight participating sites; 169 (88.9%) had data abstracted. Many patients were aged <5 years (42.6%) or >=65 years (20.7%). Meningitis was the most common clinical presentation among <1 year olds (71.4%); bacteremic pneumonia was the most common presentation among persons aged >=50 years (78.7%). Overall, 95.9% of patients were hospitalized: among those hospitalized, 47.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 6.2% died during hospitalization. At hospital discharge and one-year post-disease onset, adverse outcomes were identified in 17.7% and 17.8% of patients overall, and in 43.9% and 48.5% of patients with meningitis (primarily children). CONCLUSIONS: Hia infection can cause severe disease requiring hospitalization and may also cause short- and long-term adverse clinical outcomes, especially among children.

We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. METHODS: We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14-267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85 000 (4900-546 000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75 000 (4400-483 000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20-60 years) is 769 (148-2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14-307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0-10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3000 (182-21 000). INTERPRETATION: The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With growing antibiotic resistance and a general move towards more rational antibiotic use, early identification of clinical signs for the prediction of radiological pneumonia would help practitioners to start the treatment of patients. The main aim of this study was to reassess the clinical predictors of pneumonia in Nepal. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2015 and November 2015 at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Children aged 3-60 months with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia by a physician were enrolled in the study. Radiological pneumonia was identified and categorized as per World Health Organization guidelines by an experienced radiologist blinded to patient characteristics. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms for radiological pneumonia. RESULTS: Out of 1021 children with fever, 160 cases were clinically diagnosed as pneumonia and were enrolled for this study. Among the enrolled patients, 61% had radiological pneumonia. Tachypnea had the highest sensitivity of 99%, while bronchial breathing had the highest specificity of 100%. During univariate analysis, grunting, wheezing, nasal discharge, decreased breath sounds, noisy breathing and hypoxemia were associated with radiological pneumonia. Only hypoxemia remained an independent predictor when adjusted for all the factors. CONCLUSION: Tachypnea was the most sensitive sign, whereas bronchial breathing was most specific sign for radiological pneumonia."

We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure. RESULTS: From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the predictors of co-infection together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia."

This syndrome is usually secondary to meningococcal septicaemia, but there are many documented cases caused by other bacteria. Purpura is an essential part of the syndrome, but it is not always there. In the current study, a case of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome without purpura in an elderly patient with Haemophilus influenzae bacteraemia has been described. This patient was being managed for sepsis due to pneumonia and an incidental finding of bilateral adrenal haemorrhage was made on a CT of the thorax which was meant to evaluate empyema. This case shows the need to suspect bilateral adrenal haemorrhage in every patient with septic shock."

This study describes the evolution of resistance to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) in Hi isolates and characteristics of patients with Hi severe pneumonia. Methods: A monocentric retrospective observational study including patients from 2008 to 2017 with severe pneumonia hospitalized in ICU. Evolution of amoxicillin and AMC susceptibility was showed. Characteristics of patients with Hi pneumonia were compared to characteristics of patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) pneumonia, as reference. Risk factors for amoxicillin resistance in Hi were investigated. Results: Overall, 113 patients with Hi and 132 with Sp pneumonia were included. The percentages of AMC resistance among Hi strains decreased over the years (from 10% in 2008-2009 to 0% in 2016-2017) while resistance to amoxicillin remained stable at 20%. Also, percentages of Sp resistant strains for amoxicillin decreased over years (from 25% to 3%). Patients with Hi pneumonia experienced higher prevalence of bronchitis (18% vs. 8%, p=0.02, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (43% vs. 30% p=0.03), HAP (18% vs. 7%, p=0.01, ventilator-associated pneumonia (27% vs. 17%, p=0.04, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (8 days vs. 6 days, p=0.04) than patients with Sp pneumonia. Patients with Sp pneumonia had more frequently local complications than patients with Hi pneumonia (17% vs. 7%, p=0.03). De-escalation of antibiotics was more frequent in patients with Sp than in patients with Hi (67% vs. 53%, p=0.03). No risk factors were associated with amoxicillin resistance among patients with Hi pneumonia. Conclusions: Amoxicillin resistance was stable over time, but no risk factors were detected. AMC resistance was extremely low, suggesting that AMC could be used for empiric treatment of Hi pneumonia, as well as other molecules, namely, cephalosporins. Patients with Hi pneumonia had more pulmonary comorbidities and severe diseases than patients with Sp pneumonia."

","SPECIES:Haemophilus influenzaeID:32968689TITLE:Normal Respiratory Flora as a Cause of Community-Acquired Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Background: Intensive studies have failed to identify an etiologic agent in >50% cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Bacterial pneumonia follows aspiration of recognized bacterial pathogens (RBPs) such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus after they have colonize the nasopharynx. We hypothesized that aspiration of normal respiratory flora (NRF) might also cause CAP. Methods: We studied 120 patients hospitalized for CAP who provided a high-quality sputum specimen at, or soon after admission, using Gram stain, quantitative sputum culture, bacterial speciation by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, and viral polymerase chain reaction. Thresholds for diagnosis of bacterial infection were >=105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL sputum for RBPs and >=106 cfu for NRF. Results: Recognized bacterial pathogens were found in 68 of 120 (56.7%) patients; 14 (20.1%) of these had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Normal respiratory flora were found in 31 (25.8%) patients; 10 (32.2%) had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Infection by >=2 RBPs occurred in 10 cases and by NRF together with RBPs in 13 cases. Among NRF, organisms identified as Streptococcus mitis, which share many genetic features of S pneumoniae, predominated. A respiratory virus alone was found in 16 of 120 (13.3%) patients. Overall, an etiologic diagnosis was established in 95.8% of cases. Conclusions: Normal respiratory flora, with or without viral coinfection, appear to have caused one quarter of cases of CAP and may have played a contributory role in an additional 10.8% of cases caused by RBPs. An etiology for CAP was identified in >95% of patients who provided a high-quality sputum at, or soon after, the time of admission."

The most common pathogens associated with this condition are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides, and Hemophilus influenzae. Mortality rates range between 10 and 40% despite the availability of highly effective antibiotic therapy, and severe neurological damage affects 30-52% of survivors. The causes of death in patients with pneumococcal meningitis are multifactorial and involve both neurological complications such as cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, infarction, and septic sinus or venous thrombosis and systemic complications such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We present an unfortunate case of a 42-year-old woman with asplenia and sickle cell disease, admitted for pneumococcal meningitis, who developed diffuse cerebral edema leading to tonsillar herniation and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with a fatal outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case ever reported of meningitis complicated by both SAH and brain herniation."

In the third world countries, information about CAP etiology is scarce. Therefore, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic methods are crucial to determine etiological agents. METHODS: Between March 2016 and March 2017, we have prospectively studied the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular aspects of patients with CAP at 2 tertiary-level hospitals in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 274 children were evaluated, with a median age of 13 months. An etiologic agent was identified in 187 patients (68.2%): 54% (n = 148) were viruses and 14.2% (n = 39) were bacteria. CAP prevalence was highest among children under 2 years (71%; 195/274); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent cause in 22% (60/274), especially among infants, followed by influenza (14.5%; 40/274). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 7% of the total (19/274), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3%;8/274) and Haemophilus influenzae (1.4%;4/274). Together, these cases accounted for 79.5% (31/39) of all bacterial CAP. Pleural effusion (PE) complicated CAP in 13.8% (38/274), of which 29 were of bacterial etiology. RT-PCR increased the detection rate of pneumococcus by 47%. Coinfection occurred in 28 patients (10%); 26 (9.5%) required intensive care and 9 patients (3%) died. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR provided additional diagnostic value to conventional, clinical, and laboratory methods. The higher prevalence of RSV, influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the need for preventive measures with better vaccine uptake and future research for RSV vaccines."

Recent guidelines encourage immediate empiric antibiotic treatment once a diagnosis of CAP is made. Concerns about treatment recommendations, on the one hand, and antibiotic stewardship, on the other, motivated this review of the medical literature on the etiology of CAP. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature on the etiology of CAP using methods defined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed using a combination of the keywords 'pneumonia', 'CAP', 'etiology', 'microbiology', 'bacteriology', and 'pathogen'. We examined articles on antibiotics that were develop to treat pneumonia. We reviewed all 'related articles' as well as studies referenced by those that came up in the search. After we excluded articles that did not give sufficient microbiological data or failed to meet other predetermined criteria, 146 studies remained. Data were stratified into diagnostic categories according to the microbiologic studies that were done; results are presented as the percentage in each category of all cases in which an etiology was established. Results: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP although declining in incidence; this decline has been greater in the US than elsewhere. Haemophilus influenzae is the second most common cause of CAP, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli. The incidence of all bacteria as causes of CAP has declined because, with routine use of PCR for viruses, the denominator, cases with an established etiology, has increased. Viruses were reported on average in about 10% of cases, but recent PCR-based studies identified a respiratory virus in about 30% of cases of CAP, with substantial rates of viral/bacterial coinfection. Conclusion: The results of this study justify current guidelines for initial empiric treatment of CAP. With pneumococcus and Haemophilus continuing to predominate, efforts at antibiotic stewardship might be enhanced by greater attention to the routine use of sputum Gram stain and culture. Because viral/bacterial coinfection is relatively common, the identification of a virus by PCR does not, by itself, allow for discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy."

We studied potential etiologies of SARI among adults in six countries using multi-pathogen diagnostics. METHODS: We enrolled both adults with SARI (acute respiratory illness onset with fever and cough requiring hospitalization) and asymptomatic adults (adults hospitalized with non-infectious illnesses, non-household members accompanying SARI patients, adults enrolled from outpatient departments, and community members) in each country. Demographics, clinical data, and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected from both SARI patients and asymptomatic adults. Specimens were tested for presence of 29 pathogens utilizing the Taqman  Array Card platform. We applied a non-parametric Bayesian regression extension of a partially latent class model approach to estimate proportions of SARI caused by specific pathogens. RESULTS: We enrolled 2,388 SARI patients and 1,135 asymptomatic adults from October 2013 through October 2015. We detected >=1 pathogen in 76% of SARI patients and 67% of asymptomatic adults. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were most commonly detected (>=23% of SARI patients and asymptomatic adults). Through modeling, etiology was attributed to a pathogen in most SARI patients (range among countries: 57.3-93.2%); pathogens commonly attributed to SARI etiology included influenza A (14.4-54.4%), influenza B (1.9-19.1%), rhino/enterovirus (1.8-42.6%), and RSV (3.6-14.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of multi-pathogen diagnostics and modeling enabled attribution of etiology in most adult SARI patients, despite frequent detection of multiple pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. Seasonal flu vaccination and development of RSV vaccine would likely reduce the burden of SARI in these populations."

Methods: We studied two sampling sets (Set 1 and Set 2). Set 1 consisted of results of testing 3382 assays of out-patients and hospital patients (5-88 years old) with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia of yet undetermined aetiology. Set 2 contained results of 1204 assays of hospital patients (12-94 years old) with pneumonia and COVID-19 already diagnosed by molecular biological techniques in test laboratories. The results were collected in twelve Russian cities/provinces in time range 2 March - 5 May 2020. Assays were analysed for 10 bacterial, 15 viral, 2 fungal and 2 parasitic aetiological agents. Results: In Set 1, 4.35% of total pneumonia cases were related to SARS-CoV-2, with substantially larger proportion (18.75%) of deaths of pneumonia with COVID-19 diagnosed. However, studying Set 2, we revealed that 52.82% patients in it were also positive for different typical and atypical aetiological agents usually causing pneumonia. 433 COVID-19 patients (35.96%) were tested positive for various bacterial aetiological agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infections accounting for the majority of secondary pneumonia cases. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a COVID-19 patient as a complication. An essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Russia in March-May 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. The problem of hospital-acquired bacterial infection is exceptionally urgent in treating SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia and its further complications, should be given very serious attention in combating SARS-CoV-2."

These are also commonly found in both healthy and sick children. In this study, we describe the first data on the most frequent bacteria and viruses detected in the nasopharynx of children from the general population in the Eastern DR Congo. METHODS: From January 2014 to June 2015, nasopharyngeal samples from 375 children aged from 2 to 60 months attending health centres for immunisation or growth monitoring were included in the study. Multiplex real-time PCR assays were used for detection of 15 different viruses and 5 bacterial species and for determination of pneumococcal serotypes/serogroups in the nasopharyngeal secretions. RESULTS: High levels of S. pneumoniae were detected in 77% of cases, and H. influenzae in 51%. Rhinovirus and enterovirus were the most commonly found viruses, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was rare (1%). Co-occurrence of both bacteria and viruses at high levels was detected in 33% of the children. The pneumococcal load was higher in those children who lived in a dwelling with an indoor kitchen area with an open fire, i.e. a kitchen with an open fire for cooking located inside the dwelling with the resultant smoke passing to the living room and/or bedrooms; this was also higher in children from rural areas as compared to children from urban areas or children not living in a dwelling with an indoor kitchen area with an open fire/not living in this type of dwelling. Immunization with 2-3 doses of PCV13 was associated with lower rates of pneumococcal detection. Half of the identified serotypes were non-PCV13 serotypes. The most common non-PCV13 serotypes/serogroups were 15BC, 10A, and 12F, while 5, 6, and 19F were the most prevalent PCV13 serotypes/serogroups. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of respiratory pathogens including S. pneumoniae in Congolese children was high but relatively few children had RSV. Non-PCV13 serotypes/serogroups became predominant soon after PCV13 was introduced in DR Congo."

NTHi commonly colonizes the upper respiratory tract and causes recurrent infections of the adjacent organs. There is a rapid development of antibiotic resistance in NTHi strains, and therefore it is important to select appropriate antibiotics for treatment. We report a case of recurrent NTHi meningitis in a 5-year-old girl with a previous history of recurrent otitis media. The patient presented with fever accompanying recurrent vomiting, and beta-lactamase-positive amoxicillin/clavulanate-resistant NTHi was isolated in cerebrospinal fluid culture. Antibiotic resistance testing revealed penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation, which is an important emerging mechanism of antibiotic resistance of NTHi. Cystic cochleovestibular malformation was also identified, which may be the predisposing condition for recurrent otitis media, and invasive NTHi infection. Acute symptoms resolved with antibiotic therapy (cefotaxime, 200 mg/kg per day). After surgical revision, the patient has been in good health without recurrence. In children with recurrent respiratory tract infections, or invasive NTHi infection, it is important to consider the presence of underlying diseases and infections due to antibiotic resistant pathogens, in order to select an appropriate antibiotic agent for treatment."

Patients The study participants consisted of 7 crewmembers of the passenger cruise-liner, Diamond Princess, who were admitted to our hospital after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 aboard the ship. Methods The data on patient background and biochemical test results were obtained from the patients' medical records. All patients had a chest X-ray, and a throat swab and sputum samples were sent for culture on admission. Results The median age of the 7 patients, of whom 4 were male and 3 were female, was 39 years (range: 23-47 years). On admission, none of them had fever, but 4 (57%) had a cough. None of them showed any signs of organ damage on laboratory testing. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in one individual, which resolved spontaneously, while the other 6 had normal chest X-ray findings. Culture of throat swabs and sputum samples revealed that 4 patients (57%) had bacterial upper respiratory infections (Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus). The period from a positive PCR test to negative conversion ranged from 5 to 13 days, with a median of 8 days. Conclusion Healthy young adults without risk factors who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an asymptomatic infection or may experience mild COVID-19. In addition to obesity, an older age, underlying illness, and being overweight can lead to a risk of exacerbation; thus, hospital management for such individuals may be desirable.

Although worldwide incidence in industrialised countries where Hib vaccination is commonly used has dropped sharply since implementation of H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination, there is limited data on the disease burden caused by H. influenzae in Malaysia post vaccination era. A change in predominant serotype from type b to non-b serotypes of H. influenzae in invasive diseases was reported worldwide. We investigated the carriage of H. influenzae post vaccination era among 2-4 years old. METHODOLOGY: Randomly, we collected 436 oropharyngeal swabs from healthy children aged 2-4 years in 30 registered childcare centres in Kuala Lumpur (August 2018-May 2019). Informed consent and written questionnaires were obtained from parents. H. influenzae was identified by standard microbiological methods. Univariable analysis was carried out to describe variables associated with colonization. All variables with p < 0.25 were included in multivariable logistic regression model. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A higher carriage rate was noted among the unvaccinated children (4/28; 14.3%) compared to vaccinated children (16/326; 4.9%) but were not statistically significant. The serotypes were type a (9; 37.5%), type b (5; 20.8%), type c (3; 12.5%), type d (2; 8%), type e (1; 4.2%) and type f (4; 16.7%). Variables like age, basic sanitation, immunization status, body mass index were included in multivariable logistic regression test since p values in univariate analysis were<0.25. Planned sewage system was found to be significant (Adjusted OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.46; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Fewer carriage rates were observed among children post Hib vaccination era. Hib carriage is still possible after vaccination. The presence non-b serotypes may imply emerging replacement serotypes."

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in the childhood immunization programme in 2013 but the serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are unknown. We did a cross-sectional nasopharyngeal carriage study in Luanda and Saurimo, Angola (PCV13 3rd dose coverage 67% and 84%, respectively) during November to December 2017 comprising 940 children aged 4-12 years. The main objective was to assess vaccine serotype coverage and antimicrobial susceptibility rates for S. pneumoniae. Our secondary aim was to characterize colonizinig strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pneumococcal colonization was found in 35% (95% CI 32-39%) of children (n = 332), with 41% of serotypes covered by PCV13. The most common serotypes were 3 (8%), 18C (6%), 23F (6%), 11A (6%), 34 (6%), 19F (5%) and 16 (5%). Carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was detected in 13% (95% CI 11-15%) and 15% (95% CI 13-17%) of children, respectively. Non-susceptibility to penicillin was common among pneumococci (40%), particularly among PCV13-included serotypes (50% vs. 33%; p = 0.003), although the median minimal inhibitory concentration was low (0.19 microg/mL, IQR 0.13-0.25 microg/mL). Most pneumococci and H. influenzae were susceptible to amoxicillin (99% and 88%, respectively). Furthermore, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was>70% among all three species. Multidrug-resistant pneumococci (non-susceptible to >= 3 antibiotics; 7% [n = 24]) were further studied with whole genome sequencing to investigate clonality as an underlying cause for this phenotype. No clearly dominating clone(s) were, however, detected. The results indicate that continued use of PCV13 may have positive direct and herd effects on pneumococcal infections in Angola as carriage of vaccine serotypes was common in the non-vaccinated age group. Finally, amoxicillin is assessed to be a feasible empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections in Angola."

The prevalence of bacterial infections in these patients is not well established, and more data are needed to guide empiric antibiotic therapy and improve patient outcomes. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, we assessed bacterial coinfections identified in culture from 99 French patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 and hospitalized in intensive care units. We concomitantly evaluated an innovative molecular diagnostic technology technique, the BioFire, FilmArray Pneumonia Panel plus (FA-pneumo) assay, to identify these coinfections at an early stage, and its concordance with conventional culture. Results: We showed that a bacterial coinfection was detected in 15% of patients based on conventional culture. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were the most prevalent pathogens. The sensitivity of FA-pneumo compared with culture was 100%. In contrast, the specificity varied between 88.4% and 100% according to the pathogen, and our results highlighted that 60.5% of bacterial targets reported using this assay were not recovered by culture; 76.9% of discordant results corresponded to bacteria belonging to commensal oral flora and/or reported with <=105 copies/mL bacterial nucleic acids. Conclusions: Based on its excellent sensitivity, the FA-pneumo assay is useful to rule out bacterial coinfections in the context of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and avoid the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. However, positive tests should be interpreted carefully, taking into consideration deoxyribonucleic acid bacterial load and all clinical and biological signs."

Because empiric therapies for CAP should cover the major pathogens, reports examining CAP aetiology are considered crucial, particularly in Nordic countries that still rely on penicillin G or V treatments for most patients with CAP. The primary objective of our study was to report CAP aetiology. Secondary objectives included the estimation of positivity rates for different tests and the odds of a positive test for various subgroups. METHODS: In this cohort study, microbiological data were analysed for an overall cohort (variable degree of microbiological testing) and for a subgroup that was tested for both, bacteria, viruses and fungi, using routine methods (defined as extensive testing). RESULTS: The overall cohort comprised 2,264 patients, including 315 who were extensively tested. Bacterial and viral monoinfections were the most commonly identified infections. The dominant pathogen identified among extensively tested patients was Haemophilus influenzae (23.7%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.6%). The tests with the highest positivity rates were sputum cultures (34.7%) and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR, 24.4%). The odds of achieving a microbiological diagnosis increased significantly when extensive testing was performed compared with selective testing (OR 2.86, 95% CI 2.24-3.64). CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that H. influenzae is the dominant responsible pathogen for bacterial CAP in Denmark. Thus, we believe that the current treatment recommendations that encourage the use of penicillin G or V for the majority of patients with CAP need to be revised."

","SPECIES:Haemophilus influenzaeID:33281908TITLE:Acute bacterial sinusitis in children: an updated review.ABSTRACT:Background: In the pediatric age group, approximately 7.5% of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are complicated by acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS). Despite its prevalence, ABS is often overlooked in young children. The diagnosis and management present unique challenges in primary care. This is an updated narrative review on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of ABS. Methods: A PubMed search was performed using the key term 'acute sinusitis'. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and children. Results: Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the major pathogens in uncomplicated ABS in otherwise healthy children. In complicated ABS, polymicrobial infections are common. The diagnosis of acute sinusitis is mainly clinical and based on stringent criteria, including persistent symptoms and signs of a URI beyond 10 days, without appreciable improvement; a URI with high fever and purulent nasal discharge at onset lasting for at least 3 consecutive days; and biphasic or worsening symptoms. Conclusion: Data from high-quality studies on the management of ABS are limited. The present consensus is that amoxicillin-clavulanate, at a standard dose of 45 mg/kg/day orally, is the drug of choice for most cases of uncomplicated ABS in children in whom antibacterial resistance is not suspected. Alternatively, oral amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day can be administered. For those with severe ABS or uncomplicated acute sinusitis who are at risk for severe disease or antibiotic resistance, oral high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day) is the drug of choice."

However, the factors contributing to this susceptibility are incompletely understood. In a retrospective analysis of clinical samples collected from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 358 children we sought associations between physician-attended illness visits and bacterial colonization in the first five years of life. A subset of children was identified by unsupervised clustering analysis as infection and allergy prone (IAP). Several respiratory infection- and allergy-mediated illnesses co-occurred at higher rates in IAP children, while the rates of other illnesses were not significantly different between the groups. Analyses of nasopharyngeal (NP) pathobionts and microbiota commensals showed that early age of first colonization with pathobionts Streptococcus pneumonia, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis was associated with IAP children, and particularly Moraxella abundance was negatively associated with NP microbiome diversity. We conclude that mucosal pathobiont exposures in early life can influence susceptibility to respiratory illnesses in children."

AIMS: To describe the epidemiology and microbiology of SCAP in Central Australia. METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological study describing the characteristics, incidence rates (IR) and microbiological aetiology of SCAP in Central Australia. Adult patients admitted to Alice Springs Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between 2011-2014 that fitted the IDSA/ATS definition of SCAP were included. Medical records were reviewed and compared between Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Primary outcomes were incidence rate and microbiological aetiology of SCAP. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LoS). RESULTS: A total of 185 patents were included (156 Indigenous, 29 non-Indigenous). The overall SCAP IR per 1000 person-years was 3.24 (3.75 Indigenous and 1.87 non-Indigenous) with an IR difference of 2.71 after adjustment (p<0.001). Those aged >=50 had an IR 74.8% higher than those younger. Male IR was 50% higher than females. There was a significant difference between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups for age (48 vs. 64 years), but not for 30-day mortality (7.7% vs. 10.3%), ICU LoS (4.8 vs. 4.6 days) and hospital LoS (10.9 vs. 15.1 days), respectively. Likely causative pathogen(s) were identified in 117 patients; Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (28.2%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (19.7%), Influenza A/B (16.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14.5%). CONCLUSION: A high incidence of SCAP was observed in Central Australia, disproportionately affecting the Indigenous population. Prevention strategies are imperative, as well as early identification of SCAP and appropriate empiric antibiotic regimens. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Assessment of anti-microbial immune function is part of that assessment at many centres although there is little evidence-base on its added value in clinical assessment of this patient group. As part of reviewing our local pathway we have retrospectively reviewed these tests in 327 consecutive referrals to our severe asthma service, in an evaluation to describe the utility of these tests and allow refinement of the local guideline for patient assessment. Methods and Results: Serum immunoglobulin concentrations were in the normal range in most patients though 12 patients had serum IgG <5.5 g/L and many had suboptimal anti-Haemophilus (127 of 249 patients tested) and anti-Pneumococcal (111 of 239) immune responses. As expected many patients had evidence of sensitisation to Aspergillus although specific IgG was not confined to those with evidence of allergic sensitisation/allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Eighteen of 277 patients tested had serological evidence of Strongyloides infection. Bacteria and/or yeast were cultured from the sputum in 76 out of 110 patients productive of sputum, and the most common microbes cultured were Candida sp. (44 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (21 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (18 patients). Conclusions: Many patients had evidence of infection, colonisation or sensitisation to potential pathogens relevant to asthma. Strongyloides infection was evident in several patients, which may be a major issue when considering the risk of hyper-infection following immunosuppression and supports our local screening strategy."

Despite established guidelines for empirical therapy, several factors may influence etiology and, consequently, antibiotic choices. The aims of this study were to analyze the etiology of CAP in adults admitted to a northern Portugal University Hospital and evaluate the yield of the different methods used to reach an etiological diagnosis, as well as analyze of the impact of patient demographic and clinical features on CAP etiology. We retrospectively analyzed 1901 cases of CAP with hospitalization. The diagnostic performance increased significantly when blood and sputum cultures were combined with urinary antigen tests. The most frequent etiological agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae (45.7%), except in August, when it was overtaken by gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Legionella pneumophila infections. Viral infections were almost exclusive to winter and spring. A negative microbiological result was associated with increasing age, non-smoking and lack of both blood/sputum cultures. Younger age was a predictor for S. pneumoniae, Influenza and L. pneumophila infections. Active smoking without any previously known respiratory disease was a risk factor for legionellosis. COPD was associated with Haemophilus influenzae cases, while dementia was typical in GNB and S. aureus patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart disease were negative predictors of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively. P. aeruginosa was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 13.02, 95% CI 2.94-57.7). This study highlights the importance of a comprehensive microbiological diagnostic workup and provides clues to predicting the most probable CAP causative agents, based on a patient's clinical profile. These may be taken into account when establishing first line antibiotherapy."

This pilot study evaluates whether isolations of H. haemolyticus are frequent enough in Germany to cause a relevant diagnostic problem, considering the fact that even H. influenzae is a mere colonizer in about 30% of isolations. In microbiological laboratories of two hospitals located in Northern and Southern Germany, the distribution of Haemophilus spp. was analyzed during a six-month-period. Site of infection, sex, and age of the patients was taken into consideration. A total of 77 Haemophilus spp. isolates was acquired and discriminated on species level, comprising: 48 H. influenzae, 25 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 H. haemolyticus, and 1 Haemophilus parahaemolyticus. The proportion of H. haemolyticus was calculated to range between 1.2% and 16.2 % within the 95% confidence limits. Commensalic Haemophilus spp. were isolated from oropharynx-associated sites only. H. influenzae, in contrast, was detected in clinically relevant materials like lower respiratory materials and conjunctiva swabs. Altogether, there was a low proportion of clinical H. haemolyticus isolates. Accordingly, the problem of unnecessary antibiotic therapies due to misidentifications of H. haemolyticus as H. influenzae is quantitatively negligible compared with the risk of confusing H. influenzae colonizations with infections.

Empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with RTI must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. Europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of S. pneumoniae from France and Spain. Uniquely, in Italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. Resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-Lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. In 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 European countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. The MIC(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of S. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/L, the MICs for only five strains being &gt;2 mg/L, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations &lt;/=0.5 mg/L. The MIC(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of H. influenzae and 323 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of M. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/L. The MIC(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of Legionella pneumophila (MIC(90) 0.015 mg/L), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (MICs 0.06-0.12 mg/L). Current susceptibility data indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in European countries. The enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of S. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of RTI."

Streptococcus pneumoniae now causes approximately 30% of outpatient acute pneumonia-less than in former decades-whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae is found in both young and elderly patients. The Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus are now seen more frequently as respiratory tract pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia patients, and they are the major organisms causing pneumonia in residents of homes for the elderly or nursing homes, and in immuno-compromised patients. Agents that were previously considered non-pathogenic for the respiratory tract include serotypes of Haemophilus influenzae other than type b, H. parainfluenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis; these organisms affect mainly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Legionella species can cause sporadic as well as epidemic disease of the lower respiratory tract. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a newly recognized pathogen responsible for mild to severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In 60-80% of cases, hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus. These organisms colonize the mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract and penetrate into the lower tract by aspiration or intubation."

RSV and IV-A were prevalent in winter, whose detected rates were 35.73% (941/2634) and 4.44% (117/2634) respectively.hMPV infection was common in spring, with the detected rate at 10.55% (278/2634); while HBoV infection was common in summer and autumn, with the positive rate at 9.99% (149/1491) and 9.71% (98/1009). MP and CP were frequently detected in summer, up to 31.27% (819/2619) and 10.07% (43/427) respectively. RSV was the most common pathogen in bronchiolitis (33.27% (866/2603)) and MP was the most common pathogen in bronchopneumonia (26.05% (1152/4422)) and lober pneumonia (52.25% (267/511)). CONCLUSION: MP and RSV were the most common pathogens in respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children. The novel virus included hMPV and HBoV, which also played an important role in ARI.

Fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute Q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. In southern Taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has never been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, May 2012 to April 2013, 166 cases of adult CAP and 15 cases of acute Q fever were prospectively investigated. Cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with CAP. From April 2004 to April 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute Q fever were also included retrospectively for analysis. The geographic distribution of Q fever and CAP cases was similar. Q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than CAP. Based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were independent characteristics associated with Q fever. In patients with Q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. Twelve (7.2%) cases of CAP were seropositive for C. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute Q fever. Among CAP cases, 22.9% had a CURB-65 score  2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), S. pneumoniae (6.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. Moreover, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Taiwan, Q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as the major presentation and is not a common etiology of CAP."

HIV was heterosexually transmitted. Predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). Transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'Tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were contaminated. Pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. Bacterial pathogens isolated included Staph. aureus (5), S. pneumoniae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), H. parainfluenzae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Invading Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. No diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. It is concluded that in Central Africa pulmonary complications in AIDS patients are similar to those in Europe and North America but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. M. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. This study has confirmed that P. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently."

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens and blood specimens of 1 613 children with CAP were collected between January 2014 and December 2014 for bacterial culture and detection of 7 respiratory viruses and antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). RESULTS: The overall positive rate of bacteria was 50.22% (810 cases). Hemophilus parainfluenzae (40.8%), Streptococcus pneumonia (29.7%) and Moraxelle catarrhalis (7.3%) were the predominant ones. Among the viruses, the top detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 58.3%), followed by parainfluenza virus type3 (17.4%) and adenovirus (14.3%). A total of 481 cases (29.82%) were MP-positive. The co-infection rate was 32.18% (519 cases), and the mixed infections of bacteria and viruses were common (47.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RSV and Hemophilus parainfluenzae are the major pathogens of CAP in children from the Chongqing area. MP is also an important pathogen.

Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Of the H. influenzae isolates, 61 (64%) were serotype b and 34 (36%) were nontypable; 95% of the type b isolates were members of a single clonal group (as defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE outer membrane protein profile, and biotype). This clone is rarely observed among type b strains recovered from patients with invasive type b disease in the USA or Europe. The nontypable isolates in Islamabad also were clonally restricted: 9 clonal groups were found among 34 isolates, with just 5 clonal groups accounting for most (82%) of the strains.

A 65-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with rheumatic valve disease was submitted to surgical mitral valve repair in 1996. Physical examination did not reveal any murmurs; physical examination of the lungs and abdomen was normal. The patient was admitted to hospital with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and fever. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an approximately 8-mm filamentous image with chaotic motion in the ventricular face of the anterior mitral valve leaflet compatible with vegetation. Treatment with ceftriaxone and gentamicin was initiated. Haemophilus parainfluenzae grew in five blood culture samples. Along the hospital stay, the patient's level of consciousness decreased, and she was diagnosed with ischemic stroke of cardioembolic etiology. The patient developed septic shock refractory to the prescribed treatment and died 12 days after admission. Even though the patient started being treated for endocarditis before the infectious agent was identified, the prompt use of antimicrobials hindered the growth of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and made its isolation difficult."

Moreover, preoperative treatments such as chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (which have recently been applied worldwide) might affect the bacterial flora of the sputum. To investigate the association among preoperative treatments, the bacterial flora of sputum, and the clinical and pathological features in resected esophageal cancer patients, this study newly investigates the effect of preoperative treatments on the bacterial flora of sputum. We investigated the association among preoperative treatments, the bacterial flora of sputum, and clinical and pathological features in 163 resected esophageal cancer patients within a single institution. Pathogenic bacteria such as Candida (14.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (6.1%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (4.9%), Klebisiella pneumoniae (3.7%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), Escherichia coli (1.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%), and Haemophilus influenzae (1.2%) were found in the sputum. The pathogen detection rate in the present study was 34.3% (56/163). In patients with preoperative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, the indigenous Neisseria and Streptococcus species were significantly decreased (P= 0.04 and P= 0.04). However, the detection rates of pathogenic bacteria were not associated with preoperative treatments (all P&gt; 0.07). There was not a significant difference of hospital stay between the sputum-monitored patients and unmonitored patients (35.5 vs. 49.9 days; P= 0.08). Patients undergoing preoperative treatments exhibited a significant decrease of indigenous bacteria, indicating that the treatment altered the bacterial flora of their sputum. This finding needs to be confirmed in large-scale independent studies or well-designed multicenter studies."

METHODS: The literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data were obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, Web-of Science, and the Chinese databases Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. All CAP etiological studies on children under 5 y of age from China published in Chinese and English between the years of 2001 and 2015 were included. A total of 48 studies were included in the final review, comprising 100 151 hospitalized children with CAP episodes. Heterogeneity and the percentage of variation between studies was analyzed based on Q statistic and I2 indices, respectively. Random effect models were used to calculate the weighted average rate in all analyses. RESULTS: The most frequently detected bacterial agents were Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.2%), Escherichia coli (5.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.9%), Haemophilus influenza (3.6%) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (3.3%). The most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (20.3%, in just 2 studies), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 17.3%), human bocavirus (9.9%), parainfluenza virus (5.8%), human metapneumovirus (3.9%) and influenza (3.5%).

Despite the high prevalence of respiratory illness among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims, knowledge about the etiologic pathogens is yet very limited. Thus, this study aimed to determine the spectrum of bacterial respiratory pathogens among the Hajj pilgrims returning to Malaysia in year 2016. METHODS: Expectorated sputum specimens were collected from the Hajj pilgrims with symptomatic respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Subsequently, the bacterial pathogens were identified using the standard bacteriological culture method and Vitek II system. RESULTS: This study indicated that 255 (87.33%) out of 292 cultured sputa were positive with at least one potential pathogenic bacteria. Out of 345 total bacterial isolates, 60% (n=207) were Haemophilus influenzae, which was associated with both single bacterium infection (132/173, 76.3%) and multiple bacterial infections (75/82, 91.5%).

Recently, multidrug resistant (MDR) strains have emerged. We aim to analyse the epidemiology of HPAR at Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge between 2013 and 2017 to determine its putative role in sexually transmitted infections (STI). Strains were classified by sample origin, and antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by disk-diffusion tested on Mueller-Hinton Fastidious. MDR was defined as the resistance of the antimicrobial to three or more antibiotic class. Molecular typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after restriction with SmaI and Cfr9I. We classified 944 HPAR isolates as being of urogenital (n = 175; 18.5%), respiratory (n = 719; 76.2%), or other (n = 50; 5.3%) origins. Among the urogenital isolates, 50 (28.6%) were MDR, which was significantly higher than that found in respiratory samples (40/719; 5.6%; p &lt; 0.01). The frequency of MDR increased progressively among urogenital samples from 13.3% (2013) to 33.3% (2017) (r = 0.8; p = 0.035). The resistance rates for all 944 episodes were significantly higher for cotrimoxazole (51.4%), tetracycline (46.3%), chloramphenicol (28.0%), ciprofloxacin (21.1%), and ampicillin (20.6%). After PFGE, no clonal relationship was found. Clinical charts were available for 40 symptomatic patients with MDR HPAR infections presenting mostly urethritis (n = 26; 65.0%). In all cases, symptoms were treated effectively with combination therapy. Furthermore, in 10 of those patients with urethritis, MDR HPAR was the only potential pathogen to be identified. The emergence of MDR HPAR is a matter of concern, and the detection as a single pathogen highlights its putative role as cause of STI."

This study aimed at investigating the genomic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Taiwan and compared their evolutionary trajectories with the global strains. We performed culture and full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains followed by phylogenetic analysis. A 382-nucleotides deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was found in a Taiwanese strain isolated from a patient on February 4, 2020 who had a travel history to Wuhan. Patients in the first wave also included several sporadic, local transmission cases. Genomes of 5 strains sequenced from clustered infections were classified into a new clade with ORF1ab-V378I mutation, in addition to 3 dominant clades ORF8-L84S, ORF3a-G251V and S-D614G. This highlighted clade also included some strains isolated from patients who had a travel history to Turkey and Iran. The second wave mostly resulted from patients who had a travel history to Europe and Americas. All Taiwanese viruses were classified into various clades.

Various doubts have already appeared in preliminary stages of microbiological diagnostics of Haemophilus spp. A total of 87 H. parainfluenzae isolates were obtained from throat or nasopharyngeal swabs from adults 18 to 70 years old, both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic diseases between 2013 to 2015 in eastern Poland. Haemophilus spp. were identified by colony morphology, Gram-staining, API NH and MALDI-TOF MS technique. Both susceptibility to various antimicrobials and phenotypes of Haemophilus spp. resistance to beta-lactams were determined. Statistically significant association between applied guidelines and drug resistance patterns were observed to as follows: ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance phenotypes according to CLSI vs. EUCAST were as follows: 3.4% vs. 8.0% for BLNAR and 6.9% vs. 19.5% for BLPACR isolates. In conclusion, this is the first study that reports comparative analysis of drug susceptibility interpretation using CLSI and EUCAST of haemophili rods from human respiratory microbiota in Poland. In case of susceptible, increased exposure (formerly intermediate) category of susceptibility within H. parainfluenzae isolates we have observed EUCAST as more restrictive than CLSI. Moreover, BLNAI and BLPAI phenotype isolates have been observed, as well as BLPBR using only CLSI or EUCAST guidelines, respectively."

Efficacy was good in 80.4% of patients. More specifically, high efficacy was obtained in 76.5% of 85 pneumococcal respiratory infections, 72% of 50 Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae infections, 100% of 18 Mycoplasma infections, 100% of 16 Chlamydia infections and 93% of 14 Legionella infections. Tolerance was good in 83.5% of patients, moderate in 15.4% and poor in 6%. Venous irritation was the most frequent complication, observed in 16.3% of patients. No serious complication or sequel was observed. The authors conclude that spiramycin adipate constitutes an appropriate first-line treatment of acute bronchial and/or pulmonary infections in adults.

Here, the authors report on the clinical courses of six CF patients colonized with I. limosus. Five patients suffered from either an acute respiratory exacerbation or a progressive loss of pulmonary function, whereas one patient was in a stable clinical situation. This study focused on two aims: (i) the clonal analysis of I. limosus isolates by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, and (ii) the clarification of whether the presence of I. limosus in the respiratory tract is associated with a specific serum antibody response. Serum IgG was detected by immunoblotting using I. limosus whole-cell-lysate proteins as antigens. Sera from healthy blood donors (n=10) and from CF patients colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10) were found to be immunoblot negative. All six Inquilinus-positive patients raised serum IgG antibodies against various I. limosus antigens. Surprisingly, in one patient, a specific I. limosus serum antibody response was already detected 1 year prior to Inquilinus-positive sputum cultures. Two prominent antigens were characterized by MALDI-MS: a 23 kDa protein revealed homology to the outer membrane lipoprotein OmlA of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and an 18 kDa protein to a protein-tyrosine phosphatase of Burkholderia cepacia. In conclusion, detection of I. limosus is accompanied by a specific serum antibody response and may reflect the infectious/pathogenic potential of I. limosus. Moreover, IgG immunoblotting may be useful to detect early infection with I. limosus and may support the selective cultivation of this novel emerging pathogen."

Its correct identification ensures effective patient management and infection control strategies. However, little is known about how often CF sputum isolates are falsely identified as P. aeruginosa. We used P. aeruginosa-specific duplex real-time PCR assays to determine if 2,267 P. aeruginosa sputum isolates from 561 CF patients were correctly identified by 17 Australian clinical microbiology laboratories. Misidentified isolates underwent further phenotypic tests, amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis, and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Participating laboratories were surveyed on how they identified P. aeruginosa from CF sputum. Overall, 2,214 (97.7%) isolates from 531 (94.7%) CF patients were correctly identified as P. aeruginosa. Further testing with the API 20NE kit correctly identified only 34 (59%) of the misidentified isolates. Twelve (40%) patients had previously grown the misidentified species in their sputum. Achromobacter xylosoxidans (n = 21), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 15), and Inquilinus limosus (n = 4) were the species most commonly misidentified as P. aeruginosa. Overall, there were very low rates of P. aeruginosa misidentification among isolates from a broad cross section of Australian CF patients. Additional improvements are possible by undertaking a culture history review, noting colonial morphology, and performing stringent oxidase, DNase, and colistin susceptibility testing for all presumptive P. aeruginosa isolates. Isolates exhibiting atypical phenotypic features should be evaluated further by additional phenotypic or genotypic identification techniques."

Under the umbrella of EuroCareCF, two quality assurance trials of CF microbiology were performed in 2007 and 2008. Nine formulations with CF bacterial isolates were dispatched. A total of 31/37 laboratories from 18/21 European countries participated in the 2007 and 2008 trials. The common CF pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were correctly identified by almost all participants in both trials, even if the strains presented uncommon phenotypes. Burkholderia cenocepacia IIIB and Burkholderia vietnamensis CF isolates, however, were correctly assigned to the species level by only 26% and 27% of the laboratories, respectively. Emerging pathogens such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Inquilinus limosus, and Pandoraea pnomenusa were also not detected or were misclassified by many laboratories.

We report the first case in Italy of I.limosus isolation from the sputum sample of a cystic fibrosis patient. The patient is a 20-years-old man with cystic fibrosis, regularly attending the Regional Care Center for Cystic Fibrosis at the Federico II University Hospital of Naples.

The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis indicated the bac- terium isolated as I. limosus, confirmed by 16s rDNA sequence analysis. The described clinical case demonstrates how the bacterial biodiversity in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients is still underestimated. Cystic fibrosis lung represents an ecological niche suitable for growth of a wide variety of unusual bacteria not commonly associated with human diseases, such as I. limosus.

To date, only few small series of invasive K. kingae infections have been published, mostly from single medical centers. A nationwide multicenter study was performed to investigate the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory features of children with culture-proven K. kingae infections. METHODS: Clinical microbiology laboratories serving all 22 medical centers in Israel were contacted in a search for children aged 0 to 18 years from whom K. kingae was isolated from a normally sterile site, dating from as far back as possible until December 31, 2007. Medical records of identified patients were reviewed using uniform case definitions. RESULTS: A total of 322 episodes of infection were identified in 321 children, of which 96% occurred before the age of 36 months. The annual incidence in children aged &lt;4 years was 9.4 per 100,000. Infections showed a seasonal nadir between February and April. Skeletal system infections occurred in 169 (52.6%) children and included septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and tenosynovitis. Occult bacteremia occurred in 140 children (43.6%), endocarditis in 8 (2.5%), and pneumonia in 4 (1.2%). With the exception of endocarditis cases, patients usually appeared only mildly ill.

STUDY DESIGN: Between October 2009 and September 2016, we extracted the results of K kingae-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses performed for bone or joint specimens in patients from 2 pediatric tertiary care centers in Paris. We used data of respiratory virus detection from the Reseau National des Laboratoires network with coordination with the National Influenza Center of France. The Spearman rank correlation was used to assess a correlation between weekly distributions, with P &lt; .05 denoting a significant correlation. RESULTS: During the 7-year study period, 322 children were diagnosed with K kingae osteoarticular infection, and 317 testing episodes were K kingae-negative. We observed high activity for both K kingae osteoarticular infection and human rhinovirus (HRV) during the fall (98 [30.4%] and 2401 [39.1%] cases, respectively) and low activity during summer (59 [18.3%] and 681 [11.1%] cases, respectively). Weekly distributions of K kingae osteoarticular infection and rhinovirus activity were significantly correlated (r = 0.30; P = .03). In contrast, no significant correlation was found between the weekly distribution of K kingae osteoarticular infection and other respiratory viruses (r = -0.17, P = .34 compared with respiratory syncytial virus; r = -0.13, P = .34 compared with influenza virus; and r = -0.22, P = .11 compared with metapneumovirus).

Kingella infections have rarely been described in older individuals with chronic medical conditions or immune compromise. This is a case report of a healthy, older child who developed an invasive infection due to Kingella kingae. Clinical and laboratory details are provided of an otherwise healthy 11-year-old female who developed an acute onset of septic arthritis of her shoulder. The organism was identified by culture and 16S polymerase chain reaction. Her clinical course necessitated an antibiotic change after the organism was correctly identified. The affected child had close contact with a 2-year-old sibling who recently had a viral upper respiratory infection. This case illustrates the potential for Kingella kingae to rarely cause invasive infection in older, healthy children. Supplemental laboratory techniques may be helpful to identify this organism. Although it is reasonable to limit the antibiotic spectrum for older children, clinicians should be aware of this possibility, particularly if there is a history of close contact with young children."

The pharyngeal carriage of K. negevensis was studied by re-examining the results of a previous longitudinal study conducted in a cohort of healthy Israeli children from whom upper respiratory tract specimens were sequentially cultured between the ages of 2 and 36 months. Isolates were identified as K. negevensis by a species-specific nucleic amplification assay and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. beta-lactamase production was determined by the nitrocephin test. Kingella negevensis was detected in 26 of 4,472 (0.58%) oropharyngeal cultures obtained from 24 of 716 children (3.35%) and was not isolated from any of 4,472 nasopharyngeal specimens. Following the first 6 months of life during which none of the children was colonized, the prevalence of carriage gradually increased reaching a peak of 1.09% at 24 months of age and decreased thereafter. Kingella negevensis strains showed genomic heterogeneity, and two clones represented 22 of 26 (84.62%) isolates. Twelve of the 26 (46.15%) isolates, belonging to two distinct clones, produced beta-lactamase. Kingella negevensis shows remarkable similarities with K. kingae in terms of colonization site, age-related patterns of acquisition and carriage, and clonal distribution of beta-lactamase production. Additional research is needed to investigate potential colonization sites of K. negevensis outside the respiratory tract, explore the mechanisms of pharyngeal colonization by the organism, and determine its role as an invasive human pathogen."

Extracorporeal membrane oxyge nation (ECMO) is a support for both heart and respiratory failure. OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of infectious endocarditis (IE) due to KK which required ECMO support secondary to refractory cardiogenic shock. CLINICAL CASE: 19-months-old previously healthy female patient, with a 2-day his tory of fever, and diagnosed with hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The patient developed refractory cardiogenic shock, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and deep hemodynamic compromise that required veno-arterial ECMO support. The echography showed an image compa tible with mitral valve vegetation, confirming IE with transthoracic echocardiography. Blood culture was positive for KK. She had an ischemic stroke and required two heart surgeries, the first one for the mass resection and the second one for mitral valve repair, which had a posterior ring pseudoa neurysm. The patient had a favorable evolution and was discharged 73 days after admission. At one year of follow-up, she had no cardiological symptoms, but a mild right brachial-crural hemiparesis persisted. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of IE due to KK that required extracorporeal life support. KK endocarditis is an uncommon pathology that can cause multiorgan failure, which can be successfully supported with ECMO."

The clinical presentation and radiological imaging (Rx and CT of thorax) suggest the pattern of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). BOOP is not a disease, but a non specific pattern of answer to a lung injury. It can be either idiopathic or associated with a variety of causes, such as infections, drugs, radiations and connective tissue diseases. Besides the clinical course is complicated by the onset of an ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The gold standard for the diagnosis is represented by lung biopsy with hystopathologic confirmation but, if it cannot be done, it's necessary to start immediately steroid therapy because BOOP may be fatal. The patient received antibiotic and steroid therapy with success."

The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia."

The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia."

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to MBL-producing isolates were analyzed. METHODS: During a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an MBL-producing strain belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. We screened for MBL production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of bacteremia and 3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an MBL-producing isolate were studied. Most of the patients had previously been colonized with an MBL-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. The isolated pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to &gt;32 microg/mL) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. Tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. Molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(VIM-1) cluster in all isolates. Among the 12 K. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. Five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have failed. Twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. The attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the MIC of carbapenems. Colonization with an MBL-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. Both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria."

A total of 1,935 consecutive nonrepeat clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were collected between January 2003 and July 2005. The isolates with cefoxitin zone diameters less than 18 mm (screen positive) were selected for PCR of the bla(AmpC) genes and sequencing. Fifty-four (2.79%) isolates harbored PABLs, as demonstrated by PCR and isoelectric focusing. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of bla(DHA-1) and bla(CMY-2) genes. The Southern blot hybridization studies confirmed that bla(CMY-2) and bla(DHA-1) were located on plasmids. Based on species, PABLs were detected in 4.29% (29 isolates of DHA-1 and 1 isolate of CMY-2) of K. pneumoniae, 1.91% (11 isolates of DHA-1 and 12 isolates of CMY-2) of E. coli, and 3.03% (1 isolate of DHA-1) of K. oxytoca isolates. In contrast to our anticipation, the occurrence rate of DHA-1-producing K. pneumonia significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), from 7.54% in 2003 to 2.72% in 2004. The results of random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis indicate that the prevalences of DHA-1-producing K. pneumoniae and CMY-2-producing E. coli strains were not due to epidemic strains. In conclusion, DHA-1 was the most prevalent acquired AmpC beta-lactamase in this collection of isolates from a medical center in China, and DHA-1-producing K. pneumoniae was the most prevalent bacterium harboring a PABL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CMY-2-type AmpC beta-lactamases in the Chinese mainland."

In total 212 strains were tested. The Klebsiella genus was represented by the following species: Klebsiella pmeumoniae ss. pneumoniae (182 isolates, 85.8%), Klebsiella pneumonia ss. ozaenae (1 isolate, 0.5%), Klebsiella oxytoca (29 isolates, 13.7%). The susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method. Carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) remained to be the most active antibacterial agents. However, 1 imipenem resistant strain and 2 meropenem resistant strains were isolated. As for the 3rd generation cephalosporins, the lowest MICs were observed with the use of the inhibitor-protected agents, such as ceftazidime/clavulanic acid (MIC50 0.25 mcg/ml, MIC90 64 mcg/ml). 48.8%, 16.9%, 29.7% and only 10.5% of the isolates was susceptible to cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefoperazone respectively. Detecting of the beta-lactamase genes (TEM, SHV and CTX) was performed by PCR in 42 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae ss. pneumoniae. Alone or in various combination the TEM type beta-lactamases were detected in 16 (38.1%) isolates. SHV and CTX were detected in 29 (69%) and 27 (64.3%) isolates respectively. Combinations of 2 and 3 different determinants of resistance to beta-lactams were revealed in 23.8% and 26.2% of the isolates respectively.

Patients are typically male, older than 48 years, and have a history of chronic alcoholism. The majority of these pneumonias are community acquired. Bulging interlobar fissures and cavitation are radiographic findings said to be distinctive for Klebsiella pneumonia. We prospectively studied 15 cases of bacteremically proven Klebsiella pneumonia and found clinical and radiographic features strikingly different from those described in the literature. Immunosuppression (from corticosteroids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, neutropenia, hematologic malignancy, and transplantation) now rivals alcoholism as the primary risk factor. Cases tended to be nosocomial rather than community acquired. Neither bulging interlobar fissure nor cavitation was seen in any case. The right upper lobe was involved in 11 of our 15 cases. Pneumonia due to Klebsiella oxytoca was more likely to be isolated from patients with bilateral infiltrates, while Klebsiella pneumoniae was more likely in patients with unilateral infiltrates."

METHODOLOGY: Blood specimens received by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of Gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. RESULTS: During the seven-year period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of Gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. The eight most frequent species found were Acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (8%), Salmonella Typhi (7.5%), Escherichia coli (6.2%), Alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). At 80% susceptibility or greater, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime were active only on E. coli and S. Typhi. Cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except K. pneumonia while Amikacin showed activity against five species, A. faecalis, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and S. Typhi. Gentamycin was active against three species: E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and S. Typhi. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while Ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and S.

According to the result of the culture, the suitable antibiotic targeting the pathogen (e.g., MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca) that had grown most predominantly in the culture was used until clinical resolution of VAP, leading to avoidance of overusing broad-spectrum antibiotics and ultimately a favorable outcome. During vancomycin (VCM) therapy for MRSA VAP, MRSA bacteremia occurred even though the trough value of VCM was sufficiently high. After the change from VCM to linezolid (LZD), the VAP improved promptly, indicating that LZD is superior to VCM in the treatment of MRSA pneumonia."

METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished."

AIM: To investigate the risk factors for the acquisition of clonal multidrug-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca (MDRKO) producing the metallo-beta-lactamase IMP-8 and hyperproducing chromosomal OXY-2 beta-lactamase during a well-characterized outbreak, and to describe the clinical features of infections due to MDRKO. METHODS: A four-wave outbreak due to MDRKO occurred in the intensive care unit of a Spanish hospital between 2009 and 2011. The risk factors for acquisition of MDRKO during waves 1 and 2 (in which colonized patients served as the main reservoir for the epidemic strain) were analysed using a case-control study by Cox regression and logistic regression analysis. Clinical data and treatments of patients infected with MDRKO were also analysed. FINDINGS: For the study of risk factors, 26 cases and 45 controls were studied. None of the variables studied in the Cox regression analysis showed an association with MDRKO acquisition; time at risk was the only associated variable by logistic regression analysis. Colonization pressure was not associated with earlier acquisition. Overall, 14 patients were infected with MDRKO; ventilator-associated pneumonia (seven patients) was the most frequent type of infection. Monotherapy tended to be associated with higher mortality than combination therapy [60% (3/5) vs 16.6% (1/6); P = 0.07]. CONCLUSIONS: Time at risk was the most significant risk determinant for the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in this epidemiological context and should be included in any study of risk factors for the acquisition of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Combination therapy may be superior to monotherapy for the treatment of CRE infections."

The chronic form of the disease caused by K. oxytoca has been documented only once before. A 50-year-old immunocompetent male smoker presented with haemoptysis for 12 months. Imaging demonstrated a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe with emphysematous changes. Sputum stains and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. However, three sputum samples for aerobic culture as well as bronchial aspirate cultured pure growth of K. oxytoca. A diagnosis of chronic pneumonia due to K. oxytoca was established and with appropriate therapy, the patient was largely asymptomatic. The remarkable clinical and radiological similarity to pulmonary tuberculosis can result in patients with chronic Klebsiella pneumonia erroneously receiving anti-tuberculous therapy. "

We performed a retrospective analysis of prevalence and treatment for CRE infections patients. METHODS: This study was conducted in three tertiary care hospitals from January 1, 2010 to December 30, 2016. Baseline data, treatment, and outcomes were collected in patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), bacteremia, complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI)/acute pyelonephritis (AP), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), superficial wound infection (SWI), biliary tract infection (BTI), deep wound infection (DWI) and sterile body fluids infection (SBFI) due to CRE.

Methods: A retrospective, observational, descriptive and analytical study of the culture results from January, 2014 to December, 2015. The causative microorganisms were identified, as well as sensitivity and antibiotic resistance. Results: Of the three main HAI in the ICU were Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP), whose most common germs were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Urinary Tract Infection Associated with Urinary Catheter (IVU-CU), Escherichia coli BLEE and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated in 70%, and 56% of the bloodstream infections of the germs that caused this infection were three, the most frequent being Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella oxytoca and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusions: VAP was the most frequent HAI and resistant methicillin Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent in this type of infection. The proposed empiric antibiotic treatment was as follows: VAP (vancomycin plus amikacin plus meropenem), IVU-CU (meropenem) and STIs (vancomycin plus cefepime)."

This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted in a specialized centre for the treatment of burns from January 2009 to December 2013. The sample consisted of 404 patients, divided into two groups: the first group comprised 142 patients without infection, and the second group was made up of 262 patients who had acquired HAIs. There was a predominance of males in both groups. Mean age of the patients without infection was 37 years (SD 14.89), and 38 years (SD 15.78) for the patients with HAIs. Of the 523 infections observed in this study, pneumonia was the most frequent with 216 (41%) cases, followed by urinary tract infections with 137 (26%) episodes. The pathogens identified were Acinetobacter baumannii (93, 40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50, 21%) and Klebsiella (pneumoniae/oxytoca) (23, 10%) and were resistant to most common antimicrobials. In the study population, no pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. The present study describes high rates of infection in burn victims. Pneumonia was the most frequent site of infection, followed by urinary tract infections caused respectively by non-fermenting bacteria with a high frequency of antimicrobial resistance."

However, little is known about the respiratory microorganisms in patients with endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB), which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the tracheobronchial tree due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. We retrospectively reviewed data for histopathologically and microbiologically confirmed EBTB patients diagnosed at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea between January 2013 and January 2019. Bacterial cultures were performed on bronchial washing from these patients at the time of EBTB diagnosis. A total of 216 patients with EBTB were included in the study. The median age was 73 years and 142 (65.7%) patients were female. Bacteria were detected in 42 (19.4%) patients. Additionally, bacterial co-infection was present in 6 (2.8%) patients. Apart from MTB, the most common microorganisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14, 33.3%) followed by Klebsiella species (n = 12, 28.6%; 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Klebsiella oxytoca), Streptococcus species (n = 5, 11.9%), Enterobacter species (n = 4, 9.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 7.1%). A variety of microorganisms were isolated from the bronchial washing indicating that changes in microorganism composition occur in the airways of patients with EBTB. Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical significance of this finding."

After ten minutes cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she was resuscitated but her consciousness did'nt recover. CT-scans on the day of admission showed no abnormalities but on the second hospital day it showed symmetrical low density areas within the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the hippocampus, and the occipital lobe. There were marked enhanced effect in cerebral sulci due to cytotoxic edema of hypoxic encephalopathy. She was comatose for a week, her pupils were dilated, light reflex and other brain stem reflex were absent. CT-scans on the sixth hospital day showed marked brain swelling with disappearance of the ventricular systems (so called brain tamponade). Brain death was confirmed on the basis of Japanese Criteria on the seventh and tenth day of admission. She had been suffering from pneumonia and urinary tract infection with an elevation of temperature since the fourth hospital day. We detected Enterobacter Cloacae (E. Cloacae), Klebsiella Oxytoca from the cultures of sputum and urine. On the tenth hospital day her temperature was running up to 39.4 degrees C and blood count revealed a peripheral blood leucocytosis of 40,300/mm3 with a shift to the left. E. Cloacae was also detected from the cultures of blood. Skull roentgenogram showed multiple gas collections in the ventricular systems. CT-scans on the fourteenth hospital day showed multiple gas-containing brain abscess. The etiology of this infection was considered due to septicemia of E. Cloacae. She died from acute renal failure on the fifteenth hospital day. Consent for autopsy was not accepted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Here, we describe a case of tubercular osteomyelitis in an old fused hip of a patient with RA who received prednisolone, salazosulfapyridine (SASP), and low-dose methotrexate (MTX). A 77-year-old man with a 4-year history of RA was admitted with a complaint of general fatigue. His symptoms of RA had been well controlled with a combination of prednisolone, SASP, and low-dose MTX. Because the laboratory data showed an increase in serum C-reactive protein levels, we suspected pneumonia. There was expansion of a pre-existing consolidation in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest computed tomography, and the sputum culture was positive for Klebsiella oxytoca. His family physician prescribed empiric antibiotics for pneumonia. Although the QuantiFERON  test result was positive, the acid-fast bacillus staining result was negative in the sputum. He started complaining of pain in his left hip, where arthrodesis was performed for an unknown reason at the age of 20 years. Sonographic examination of his left thigh revealed fluid collection. The aspiration culture of the fluid was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was initiated on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Surgical debridement of the fused left hip was performed twice along with a removal of previously implanted materials. Although infrequent, osteoarticular tuberculosis can occur during immunosuppressive therapy, especially in elderly patients. Physicians should be aware of a history of possible tuberculosis infection, such as hip arthrodesis, when prescribing MTX along with SASP and corticosteroid in the elderly."

Materials and Methods: A total of 120 unique CRE clinical isolates were collected and carbapenemase genes were detected using PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using standard broth microdilution method and the results were interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints. Results: The 120 carbapenem-resistant strains included 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Escherichia coli, 10 Enterobacter cloacae, five Klebsiella aerogenes, and three Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Seventy-four percent of these 120 CRE isolates were collected from patients located in non-ICUs; 65.0% of these CRE isolates were collected from male patients; and 34.2% of these isolates were isolated from respiratory tracts. Four different carbapenemase genes were identified among 103 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates, including bla KPC-2 (n=77), bla NDM-1 (n=16), bla NDM-5 (n=12) and bla IMP-4 (n=2). Overall, 21.7%, 37.5%, 40.8%, 75.0%, and 100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, CAZ/AVI, and ATM/AVI, respectively. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 96.7% isolates (n=116) were resistant to aztreonam, and the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) significantly reduced the MICs of those aztreonam-resistant isolates by more than 128-fold (range: <=0.125-4 mg/L), and 90.0% (n=108) of total 120 isolates were inhibited at ATM/AVI concentration <=1 mg/L. Conclusion: Our study revealed significant antimicrobial resistance among the CRE isolates against some commonly used antibiotics in three secondary Chinese hospitals. ATM/AVI exhibited potent activity against CRE isolates, including double carbapenemase-producing isolates, whereas CAZ/AVI was active against all KPC producers."

We report the predisposing factors, clinical features and outcome of 44 hospitalized patients in whom Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated. Twenty-one (48%) isolates were community-acquired and 23 (52%) were considered nosocomial in origin. Most of the patients were elderly males with serious underlying diseases. There were significant differences between those patients who acquired Klebsiella oxytoca in the hospital and in the community. Nosocomially acquired organisms were associated with a higher mortality (52% vs. 24%) (p less than 0.05), a higher incidence of infection vs. colonization (83% vs. 57%) (p less than 0.05), and a higher percentage of cases of pneumonia (43% vs. 19%) (p less than 0.05). The clinical features, the hospital service and the patients' underlying diseases were similar when patients who died and those who survived were compared. Patients who died were exposed to antibiotics more often prior to the positive culture with K. oxytoca (p less than 0.05). K. oxytoca is a significant pathogen in hospitalized elderly patients. It is likely to cause infections, especially pneumonia, and carry a high mortality. The organism can become endemic within the hospital setting with continued carriage and nosocomial spread."

Ten of the Klebsiella isolations from sputum and one from a blood culture were identified as Klebsiella oxytoca. The clinical and radiological features of six patients are described. Four of these patients had lobar pneumonia, one bronchopneumonia, and one acute respiratory tract infection superimposed on cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. One of the patients with lobar pneumonia had a small-cell carcinoma of the bronchus. We concluded that Klebsiella oxytoca was of definite pathogenic significance in these six patients and of uncertain significance in the remaining five patients. Klebsiella oxytoca has not previously been described as a specific pathogen in the respiratory tract.

The annual number of patients with positive blood cultures increased from 306 in 1988 to 622 in 1993, representing a 4.5-6% positivity rate of drawn cultures. After E. coli, Klebsiella was the leading cause of Gram-negative bacteraemia. During this period, the absolute number of Klebsiella bacteraemia increased from 25 in 1988 to 84 in 1993; this represents a true increase in Klebsiellaa bacteraemia, from 6-7% of positive cultures in the late 1980s to 12-13% in more recent years. There were 210 cases with K. pneumoniae and 31 with K. oxytoca. A representative sample of 80 records was retrieved and subdivided into two groups: community-acquired Klebsiella bacteraemia (CAKB) vs. hospital-acquired Klebsiella bacteraemia (HAKB). Urinary tract infection was the underlying source of 58% of CAKB vs 28% of HAKB (p &lt; 0.01); pneumonia occurred significantly more often in HAKB (25%) than in CAKB (7%) (p &lt; 0.01). In HAKB, as compared to CAKB, serious manifestations of illness were more common, e.g. shock (65% vs. 37%, p &lt; 0.046) and respiratory failure (45% vs. 20%, p &lt; 0.046). Overall mortality was 32%, 22% of patients with CAKB died vs. 42% of those with HAKB (p &lt; 0.05). Multiple drug resistance was very common: only 57% of all Klebsiella strains were susceptible to gentamicin, 66% to ceftriaxone, 70% to ciprofloxacin, and 83% to amikacin. The susceptibility rates of Klebsiella spp isolated from patients with HAKB were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.001). Sepsis due to multiple-drug-resistant Klebsiellaa has become frequent, carrying significant morbidity and mortality. Restriction of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in the hospital and the community as well as implementation of infection control measures are needed to contain this problem."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 74-year-old patient suffering from a nasal polyposis that had been repeatedly operated was admitted for surgery of the frontal sinus. The day of surgery, the difficult intubation required a laryngotracheoscopy, which found a dystrophic trachea, with a sprinkling of whitish nodules, and hard swelling. The pathologic exams of a large biopsy specimen using a rigid bronchoscopy provided the diagnosis of tracheopathia osteoplastic. A complementary workup to search for the etiology was undertaken. The risk and the difficulty of the intubation led to suspending the surgery. RESULTS: The CT scan as well as the histological, bacteriological, and immunological tests showed nothing specific. The etiopathogenic hypothesis was the association of chronic disease of the upper airways such as the ozena or the chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, an endocrine factor, dermatomyositis, exposure to toxic substances such as silica, or tracheobronchial amyloidosis. The bronchial microbiology test is positive in more than 50% of patients, and often Klebsiella ozaenae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa is found. CONCLUSION: Tracheopathia osteoplastica is a rare tumor, with unknown etiology and physiopathology. The discovery is most often incidental. Progession is slow and it does not compromise the vital prognosis. The treatment is symptomatic. Few surgical tracheal operations are described in the literature."

It is occasionally seen in the United States of America (USA). It predominately affects the nasal mucosa but can also involve the rest of the upper respiratory tract. The well-known causative agent for rhinoscleroma is the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, a subspecies of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, Klebsiella ozaenae can also, albeit very rarely, cause rhinoscleroma. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology examination that shows the characteristic Mikulicz cells, considered pathognomonic for this infection. We report a patient with histologically proven rhinoscleroma with pharyngolaryngeal involvement in whom cultures yielded Klebsiella ozaenae. To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of rhinoscleroma due to Klebsiella ozaenae have been reported in the literature to date. Our case illustrates the importance of recognizing this infection in a nonendemic setting such as the USA. A lack of awareness and a delay in the diagnosis of this disease can lead to complications including upper airway obstruction, physical deformity, and, rarely, sepsis. In addition, it must be remembered that the treatment of rhinoscleroma is challenging and requires a prolonged course of antibiotics to achieve a definite cure and avoid relapses. "

The clinical data of all patients including gender, age, past medical history, exposure to antibiotics, medication, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, serum albumin, tracheotomy, re-intubation, prognosis, and pathogenic bacteria and drug sensitivity test of VAP patients were collected. The patients were divided into VAP group and non-VAP group according to the occurrence of VAP. The differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The risk factors of VAP were analyzed by multivariate Logistic regression. The distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in sputum culture of lower respiratory tract of VAP patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 234 patients on mechanical ventilation, 95 patients had VAP, and the incidence of VAP was 40.60%.

The isolation rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was the highest, reaching 31.48% (34/108); the isolation rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii were 22.22% (24/108), 8.33% (9/108) and 9.26% (10/108), respectively. Gram-positive (G+) bacteria accounted for 6.48% (7/108), of which Staphylococcus aureus was 4.63% (5/108); and fungi was 7.41% (8/108). Drug resistance analysis showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100% sensitive to amikacin (AMK), meropenem (MEM) and polymyxin (POL), and were suggested as the preferred drug. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% sensitive to AMK, tobramycin (TOB) and POL, but 100% resistant to compound trimethoprim (PCST). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was 100% sensitive to PCST and 100% resistant to AMK, piperacillin (PIP), piperacillin tazobactam (TZP) and TOB. Acinetobacter baumannii was 100% sensitive to cefoxitin (FOX), cefuroxime (CXM) and POT. Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to gentamicin (GEN), furantoin (NIT), rifampicin (RIF), vancomycin (VAN) and teicoplanin (TEC), while the drug resistance to clindamycin (CLI) and penicillin (PEN) was high (both 80.00%). Most pathogens were multidrug-resistant. The mortality of patients with multidrug resistant bacteria infection was significantly higher than that of non-multidrug resistant bacteria infection [51.85% (28/52) vs. 30.56% (11/36), chi 2 = 4.240, P = 0.046]. CONCLUSIONS: VAP was associated with brain injury and cerebrovascular accident, duration of mechanical ventilation &lt; 7 days, albumin &gt; 28 g/L and tracheotomy. VAP patients were infected mainly with G- bacteria and showed multiple drug resistance."

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi locus sequence typing were performed to evaluate the clonal relationships of these isolates. Statistical methods were then used to understand their possible relationship between CRKP and their GNNs. Among the 63 CRKP isolates, 84.1% produced a KPC-2 carbapenemase gene, followed by blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-38 like. 13 different STs and 29 clones were identified. Less heterogeneous clone backgrounds were observed in 53 KPC-2 K. pneumoniae isolates, and 6 STs have been found to contain KPC-2, of which the predominant ST11 harbored 47 KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. Particularly, the two infrequent isolates co-possessing blaKPC-2 and blaIMP-38 like shared a different clonal relationship. 87 GNNs isolates of CRKP were established, the analysis present that different strains showed significant or no difference with CRKP upon antibiotics susceptibility. Conclusion, ST11 harboring KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were dominant for NP, and both clonal spread and horizontal transfer contributed to the dissemination of CRKP. However, additional studies are needed to explore the biological relationship with their GNNs."

The major causes of pneumonia in neurologic patients may differ from those in the general population, resulting in a different pathogen distribution. We investigated the trends of pathogen distribution in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients and the related antibiotic resistance in those with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: A retrospective study was performed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea. Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology with a positive respiratory specimen culture between 2007 and 2016 were included. Pneumonia events in patients were screened by chronologically associating the date of respiratory specimen acquisition for culture studies and the date of antibiotics administration. Subgroup analyses regarding multidrug resistance in HAP were performed in different pneumonia categories, by presence of &gt;=1 risk factor and by time period (first half vs. second half of study period). Microbial resistance profiles of isolates from patients with pneumonia were analyzed. Results: We identified 351 pneumonia cases in 227 patients involving 36 different pathogens. 232 cases were HAP, of which 70 cases were intensive care unit (ICU)-HAP. The leading pathogens were Stapylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, which were isolated in 133 (37.9%), 72 (20.5%), 55 (15.7%), 44 (12.5%), 33 (9.4%), and 27 (7.7%) cases, respectively. Cases with HAP showed a higher proportion of P. aeruginosa and a lower proportion of S. pneumoniae (both, p &lt; 0.05) than those with non-HAP. ICU-HAP isolates showed a higher multidrug resistance (MDR) rate than non-ICU-HAP isolates (p &lt; 0.005) in those with &gt;=1 MDR risk factor. Non-susceptibility to imipenem (p &lt; 0.0005), piperacillin-tazobactam (p &lt; 0.001), cefepime (p &lt; 0.005), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p &lt; 0.05) in Gram-negative pathogens increased over time in both ICU and non-ICU settings. Conclusions: S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, and E. aerogenes were the leading isolates in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients. Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative pathogens in neurologic patients with culture-positive HAP has recently increased."

Pneumonia of polymicrobial aetiology predicts worse pathology with fulminating clinical course. Reports of necrotising pneumonia from multiple bacterial infections are scanty in published literature. We report a case of a toddler with NP in whom Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus, two pathogens which are well documented in its aetiopathogenesis, were isolated concurrently from his sputum and blood. Severe pneumonia, which shows slow response to recommended antibiotics treatment, should raise the suspicion of NP and possibly one of the polymicrobial origins.

In recent year, few investigations have reported the enhancement of K. pneumoniae population in patients using corticosteroid containing inhaler. OBJECTIVES: The biological mechanism(s) behind this increased incidence has not been elucidated. Therefore, the objective of this investigating was to explore the relation between Klebsiella pneumoniae and increment in carbapenamase producing Enterobacteriaceae score (ICS). METHODS: The available genomes of K. pneumoniae and the amino acid sequences of steroid catabolism pathway enzymes were taken from NCBI database and KEGG pathway tagged with UniPort database, respectively. We have used different BLAST algorithms (tBLASTn, BLASTp, psiBLAST, and delBLAST) to identify enzymes (by their amino acid sequence) involved in steroid catabolism. RESULTS: A total of 13 enzymes (taken from different bacterial candidates) responsible for corticosteroid degradation have been identified in the genome of K. pneumoniae. Finally, 8 enzymes (K. pneumoniae specific) were detected in four clinical strains of K. pneumoniae. This investigation intimates that this ability to catabolize corticosteroids could potentially be one mechanism behind the increased pneumonia incidence. CONCLUSION: The presence of corticosteroid catabolism enzymes in K. pneumoniae enhances the ability to utilize corticosteroid for their own nutrition source. This is the first report to demonstrate the corticosteroid degradation pathway in clinical strains of K. pneumoniae."

Lack of a microbiological diagnosis impairs precision treatment in CAP. METHODS: Specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract of 195 CAP patients, viruses were measured by the Single-plex real-time PCR assay and the conventional culture method was exploited for bacteria. RESULTS: Among the 195 patients, there were 46 (23.59%) pure bacterial infections, 20 (10.26%) yeast infections, 32 (16.41%) pure viral infections, 8 (4.10%) viral-yeast co-infections, and 17 (8.72%) viral-bacterial co-infections. The two most abundant bacteria were Acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas the most common virus was influenza A. CONCLUSIONS: Non-influenza respiratory microorganisms frequently co-circulated during the epidemic peaks of influenza, which easily being ignored in CAP therapy. In patients with bacterial and viral co-infections, identifying the etiologic agent is crucial for patient's therapy."

The actual burden of HIV-infected patients with pneumonia is not well documented in Mekelle region of Ethiopia. This study estimated the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in HIV patients, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens implicated in pneumonia, and associated risk factors in Mekelle zone, Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, during August-December 2016. Methods: Sputum specimens were collected from 252 HIV seropositive individuals with suspected pneumonia. Data on sociodemographics and risk factors were also collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood, Chocolate, and Mac Conkey agar plates (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) were used to grow the isolates. The isolated colonies were identified based on Gram stain, colony morphology, pigmentation, hemolysis, and biochemical tests. The antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 and p-value &lt; 0.05 with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of the 252 samples, 110 (43.7%) were positive for various bacterial species. The predominant bacterial species were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=26, 23.6 %) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17, 15.5 %), Escherichia coli (n=16, 14.5%), Klebsiella spp. (n=15, 13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=9, 8.2%), Enterobacter spp. (n=7, 6.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4, n=3.6%), Proteus spp. (n=4, 3.6%), Citrobacter freundii (n=7, 6.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3, 2.7%), and Haemophilus influenzae (n=2, 1.8%). Young age (18-29), recent CD4+ count less than 350 cells/mL, alcohol consumption, and HIV WHO stage II showed significant association with the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia. Resistance to penicillin, co-trimoxazole, and tetracycline was observed in 81.8%, 39.8%, and 24.5% of the isolates, respectively. Conclusions: The problem of pneumonia among HIV patients was significant in the study area. The high prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria isolated from the patient's samples possesses a health risk in immunocompromised HIV patients. There is a need to strengthen and expand culture and susceptibility procedures for the administration of appropriate therapy to improve patients management and care which may aid in decreasing the mortality."

Studies focusing on S. aureus pneumonia in DM is limited, we sought to make a relatively comprehensive exploration of clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, and risk factors for mortality of S. aureus pneumonia in DM and non-diabetics mellitus (non-DM). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in Ruijin Hospital from 2014 to 2017. The characteristics of DM and non-DM patients were assessed, including demographics, comorbidities, using of invasive mechanical ventilation, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age &gt;=65 years (CURB-65) score, length of hospital stay, clinical outcomes, antimicrobial susceptibility. Independent risk factors for mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 patients with S. aureus pneumonia were included in our study, including 144 with DM and 221 non-DM. DM patients were more susceptible to MRSA infection (65.3% vs. 56.1%, P &gt; 0.05), suffered from much severer pneumonia with a higher CURB-65 score, invasive mechanical ventilation rate (46.5% vs. 28.1%, P &lt; 0.01) and mortality rates (30.6% vs. 23.1%, P &gt; 0.05); almost all DM patients had higher antimicrobial resistance than non-DM patients, the DM group had a higher co-infection rate (47.2% vs. 45.7%, P &gt; 0.05), and Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common bacterium in DM, while Klebsiella pneumoniae ranked first in patients with non-DM. Independent risk factors for pneumonia-related mortality were MRSA and CURB-65. Higher HbA1c levels were linked to a higher MRSA infection and co-infection rate and more severe pneumonia, leading to an increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: DM patients with poor glucose control are more susceptible to MRSA infection. They suffer from higher antimicrobial resistance, a higher co-infection rate, and much severer pneumonia than non-DM. MRSA itself is an independent risk factor for mortality in all patients."

The increase in multi-drug resistant bacteria has not been accompanied by the validation of new drugs, or by any new antimicrobial strategies to exploit the available agents. VAP due to Gram-negative bacteria has increased mortality, both due to the resistant pathogens themselves and due to inappropriate treatment. Local epidemiology, patients' characteristics and clinical responses provide the most important information for therapeutic decision-making. Moreover, data on VAP therapy due to resistant bacteria are lacking, and the choice of treatment is often based on clinical practice and individual experience. Areas covered: This review summarizes the strategies available for treating the three most prevalent resistant Gram-negative organisms causing VAP: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. The review covers the results of a Pubmed search, clinical practice guidelines and reviews, and the authors' experience. Expert opinion: The existing evidence focuses on bloodstream infections or other sites rather than pneumonia and there are no recommendations for the treatment of VAP by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, especially for combination regimens. The approval of new drugs is needed to provide effective and safe alternatives for treating carbapenemase-producing strains. Precision medicine and personalized approach are also fundamental in future research."

Bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated with this infection varied between geographical regions. Knowledge of the pathogens in a given area and their up-to-date AMR profile is essential for optimal management of patients. This study was aimed at assessing the type of bacterial isolates and their AMR among CAP adult patients at the Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 April to 30 July 2018. Demographic related data were collected from the study participants using a structured questionnaire. Sputum samples were collected and processed to identify pathogens using the conventional culture and biochemical tests as per the standard procedures. The Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method was implemented for the AMR testing. Descriptive and multivariable analysis was conducted using SPSS version 23. Results: Among 414 presumptively diagnosed study participants for CAP, bacterial pathogens were identified from 167 (40.3%) participants. Among these, multidrug resistance (MDR) accounted for 127(76%) of the isolates. The predominant isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae at 60(35.9%) and Klebsella pneumoniae at 30(18%). Overcrowded living conditions [AOR 1.579 (95%CI: 1.015-2.456)] and alcohol use [AOR 4.043 (95% CI, 2.537-6.443)] were found statistically associated with culture positive sputum. Conclusions: The study showed high prevalence of mono- and multi-drug resistant isolates in the study area. Therefore, regular surveillance of the type of isolates and their AMR patterns should be considered.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae causing pneumonia at a large teaching hospital in China. METHODS: We collected patient's clinical data and ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains causing pneumonia (from December 2015 to June 2016) at a hospital in Wuhan. The susceptibilities, multi-locus sequence typing, homologous analysis, ESBL genes by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were determined. RESULTS: A total of 59 ESBL-producing strains (31 E. coli and 28 K. pneumoniae) isolated from patients with pneumonia were analyzed. The majority of strains were isolated from patients were with hospital-acquired pneumonia (37/59, 62.7%), followed by community-acquired pneumonia (13/59, 22.0%), and ventilator-related pneumonia (9/59, 15.3%). The E. coli ST131 (9 isolates, 29.0%) and K. pneumoniae ST11 (5 isolates, 17.9%) were the predominant sub-types. The most prevalent ESBL gene was CTX-M-14, followed by SHV-77, CTX-M-3, SHV-11, and CTX-M-27. At least 33 (55.9%) of the ESBL-producing strains carried two or more ESBL genes. The ISEcp1 and IS26 were found upstream of all blaCTX-M (CTX-Ms) and of most blaSHV (SHVs) (57.6%), respectively.

We describe a case of sustained and severe hypoglycemia in a patient treated with tigecycline for pneumonia due to MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old man was admitted for treatment of pneumonia. At admission he had prediabetes. In the hospital he developed renal failure. On day 3, the patient experienced severe shortness of breath. He was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilator support. In the ICU the antibiotic regimen was cefoperazone and sulbactam (1 g every 12 h). Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy was started on that day. Test for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was positive, and so the nephrologist and rheumatologist agreed on a diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, with renal and pulmonary involvement and acute renal failure. Plasmapheresis, and high-dose methylprednisolone treatment were started on day 6, and there was obvious improvement in the patient's condition. The steroid regimen was gradually tapered to oral prednisone (35 mg every day) on day 19. Afterwards, the patient's pneumonia worsened. Sputum culture showed Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to only tigecycline. Tigecycline treatment (100 mg every 12 h) was administered on day 20. Hypoglycemia started about 37 h after the first dose of tigecycline. Infusion of 50% glucose through the femoral vein was required for over 20 h to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. Tigecycline was stopped, but the hypoglycemia resolved only after a further 34 h. The insulin and C-peptide levels were found to be markedly elevated during the hypoglycemia. The Naranjo scale score of 7 indicated that the likelihood of tigecycline causing severe hypoglycemia was ""probable."" CONCLUSION: This is the first report of sustained severe hypoglycemia due to tigecycline. Oversecretion of insulin appears to have been the cause of the hypoglycemia in our patient. The mechanism needs to be investigated."

Patients with Klebsiella pneumonia infection were stratified into two groups based on the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). MLR was calculated by dividing monocytes count by lymphocytes count obtained from routine blood examination. The area under the curve (AUC) values was determined using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between the variables was tested with Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between MLR and the severity of Klebsiella pneumonia infection.One hundred fifty-two patients were finally enrolled for analysis. Among those, 43 (28.29%) cases had severe KPI. MLR was found to be an independent risk factor of the serious Klebsiella pneumonia infection (OR: 23.74, 95% CI: 5.41-104.11, P &lt; .001). Besides, MLR was positively correlated with NEWS score (r = 0.57, P &lt; .001). In the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, MLR, with an optimal cut-off value of 0.665, predicted the severe coronary lesion with a sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 84.4%.MLR was an independent predictor of the severe Klebsiella pneumonia infection. Compared with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), MLR has a better performance to evaluate the severity of Klebsiella pneumonia infection."

","SPECIES:Klebsiella pneumoniaeID:31619219TITLE:Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to be based on site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed or because of unrecognition of the pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managing in general wards. METHODS: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 h were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study. RESULTS: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood culture than patients with non-severe CAP (24% VS 4.5%; p = .008). Initial antibiotic treatment were discordant with the IDSA/ATS guidelines in 42% of all patients hospitalized with CAP, and 52% of patients with severe CAP. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and initial antibiotic treatment discordant to guidelines for severe CAP in ICU (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3-17.1) were independent risk factors of the unfavorable outcome of patients with severe CAP. Patients with unfavorable outcome had lower number of hospital-free days than patients with favorable outcome (5.2 +- 8 days VS 18 +- 7.1 days; p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes."

BACKGROUND: Stroke patients are at risk of colonisation by respiratory pathogens due, in part, to sudden discontinuation of effective oral hygiene. When combined with reduced cough reflex sensitivity, aspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal contents and can lead to pneumonia. Relationships between oral bacteria, cough sensitivity and pneumonia have not been established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 102 patients with acute stroke underwent saliva sampling and cough reflex testing at admission to hospital, discharge, and one month. A qPCR assay compared levels of bacteria in saliva. Pneumonia events were recorded. RESULTS: Relative levels of bacteria were lowest at admission to hospital (6.04 x 10-6 ). There was a slight (non-significant) increase in bacterial levels at discharge (1.69 x 10-2 , p = .73). By one-month, bacterial levels had signficiantly increased (9.17 x 10-2 ) relative to admission [p &lt; .001] and discharge [p &lt; .001]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli are not typically found in healthy mouths, yet were detected in 22% of patients during hospitalisation. Combined bacterial levels measured at one month was associated with pneumonia (p = .004) but there was no relationship to cough sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Acute stroke patients were at increased risk of colonization from respiratory pathogens throughout their recovery. The presence of these pathogens in saliva at one month was associated with adverse respiratory events. Data support the development of protocols to explore risk factors and sequelae of microbiological changes in stroke."

Klebsiella spp. are major pathogens in healthcare-associated infections, and their importance is increasing. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of Klebsiella spp. chest infections by evaluating the differences in the characteristics of chest infections caused by Klebsiella spp. and pneumoniae. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients hospitalized with pneumonia, lung abscess/necrotizing pneumonia, and empyema due to Klebsiella spp. and S. pneumoniae for 15 years at our institution in Saitama, Japan. Patients Patients with chest infections due to Klebsiella spp. (K group, n=76) and S. pneumoniae (S group, n=446) were included. Results The K group more frequently was male, older, coinfected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and had diabetes mellitus, a history of upper digestive system surgery, alcohol drinking habit, a smoking habit, and an impaired premorbid performance status than the S group. The percentages of lung abscesses or necrotizing pneumonia (31.6% vs. 0.9%) and empyema without pulmonary parenchymal shadow (3.9% vs. 0.7%) were higher in the K group than those in the S group. Severity on admission and mortality did not differ between the groups; however, patients in the K group required a longer duration of antibiotics administration and hospital stay than those in the S group. Conclusion Klebsiella spp. chest infections have some marked characteristics when compared with pneumococcal infections, and our results serve to differentiate Klebsiella spp. infection from pneumococcal infection."

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics."

During a two-month study period, 154 (mean age: 75.2 ++ 12.2 years; 94 males) out of 620 (24.8%) hospitalized patients underwent 174 blood cultures and were enrolled in the study. The rate of true-positive cultures was 11.5% (20/174) and the rate of false-positive (contaminants) was 5.7% (10/174). A total of 23 microorganisms (5 multidrug resistant strains), most frequently Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), were isolated. The positivity rate was significantly higher in patients with urinary tract infection (31%) and abdomen infection (26.1%) than in patients with pneumonia (4.9%; p<0.01). Although the positivity rate in patients exposed to antibiotics was lower than in those not exposed, the difference was not statistically significant. Therapy changes due to blood culture positivity were observed in 7.1% of the patients overall. In-hospital death was observed in nine of the 136 patients with negative blood cultures (6.6%) and in none of the 18 patients with positive blood cultures. These results indicate that the yield and clinical impact of blood cultures is quite low in patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward and suggest the need to improve the adequacy of the indications to perform the test."

In this retrospective study, 257 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu Province were enrolled from January 22 to February 2, 2020. They were re-confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and tested for 39 respiratory pathogens. In total, 24 respiratory pathogens were found among the patients, and 242 (94.2 %) patients were co-infected with one or more pathogens. Bacterial co-infections were dominant in all COVID-19 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The highest and lowest rates of co-infections were found in patients aged 15-44 and below 15, respectively. Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease. In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases.

Among these, sporadic hvKp-related community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an acute-onset, rapidly progressing disease that can likely turn fatal, if left untreated. However, the clinical diagnosis of hvKp infection remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms, lack of awareness regarding this disease, and no consensus definition of hvKp. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old man presented with high-grade fever and sudden-onset chest pain. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 11,600 cells/mul and C-reactive protein level (>32 mg/dl). A chest X-ray and computed tomography revealed a focal consolidation in the left lower lung field. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of fulminant CAP caused by a hvKp K2-ST86 strain was made based upon multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. OUTCOMES: The pneumonia became fulminant. Despite intensive care and treatment, he eventually died 15.5 hours after admission. LESSONS: This is the first case of fatal fulminant CAP caused by a hvKp K2-ST86 strain reported in Japan. MLST was extremely useful for providing a definitive diagnosis for this infection. Thus, we propose that a biomarker-based approach should be considered even for an exploratory diagnosis of CAP related to hvKp infection."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from 2009 to 2012 were recruited for this population-based and observational study. Diabetes complications severity index (DCSI) score and defined daily dose (DDD) were used for analysis. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia by DPP4i use, with adjustments for propensity score. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia for DPP4i users. RESULTS: 34774 patients were included. The incidence rate of KP pneumonia in DDP4i users was 1.51 per 1000 person-years and that for the comparison was 2.25 per 1000 person-years. DDP4i users also had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of KP pneumonia (log-rank test p-value = 0.03). DDP4i users had a significantly lower risk of developing KP pneumonia compared with nonusers (adjusted HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48-0.95).

The risk factors of pneumonia in convalescent patients who have experienced stroke remain poorly defined. METHODS: To identify the risk factors of pneumonia, we applied logistic regression as a statistical method using SPSS23.0 statistical software, based on a sample of 380 patients. And statistical description method was used to analyze pathogens' characteristics and drug resistance. RESULTS: Ultimately, the obtained logistic model has statistical significance (chi2(13) = 91.560, P <0.0005). The sensitivity of the model is 41.7%, the specificity is 97.6%, the positive predictive value is 76.9%, and the negative predictive value is 89.8%. The Barthel index (BI) (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), basic lung diseases (OR=4.24, 95% CI: 1.02-17.61), trachea ventilation (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 1.18-36.34), feeding tube (OR=6.06, 95% CI: 2.59-14.18), and hypoproteinemia (OR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.56-10.10) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lower BI scores, basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are independent risk factors of pneumonia among convalescent patients with stroke. The main pathogens that caused pneumonia were gram-negative bacteria, and such organisms have different degrees of resistance to drugs."

The biggest problem in infections with K.pneumoniae is that treatment options are limited due to multiple antibiotic resistance and consequently the increased morbidity and mortality. The widespread and improper use of carbapenems can lead to epidemics that are difficult to control, especially in intensive care units because of the acquired resistance to this group of antibiotics. Outbreaks and sporadic cases caused by carbapenem resistant K.pneumoniae (CRKP) species have been reported all over the world in recent years with increased frequency. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors related to carbepenem resistance and mortality caused by K.pneumoniae infections in a university hospital anesthesia intensive care unit. The study was conducted between January 1st, 2016, and December 31st, 2018. Retrospective data were obtained from the patient and laboratory-based surveillance records. Adult patients (>= 18 years) with K.pneumoniae growth in the blood, urine, abscess and tracheal aspirate samples collected 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit were considered as the relevant infection locus-related agent and treated with antibacterial therapy. Clinical samples collected from patients were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood and eosin-methylene-blue (EMB) agar except the blood samples. Blood samples were cultured in blood culture bottles and incubated in an automated system. Gram staining was performed for the samples showing growth signal within five days and then inoculated onto 5% sheep blood and EMB agar media and were incubated for 18-24 hours at 35.5-37 C. Identification of the isolates was performed using Bruker IVD MALDI Biotyper 2.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Almanya) based on ""matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)"". K.pneumoniae isolates were identified by obtaining reliability scores of 2.0 and above in the study. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed with Phoenix 100 (BD, New Jersey, ABD) automated system. Interpretations were made according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Combination disk diffusion test and polymerase chain reaction based tests were used to show the presence of carbapenemase in CRKP isolates. A total of 88 patients with K.pneumoniae infection were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 74 +- 15 (range= 21-93) years and 60.2% were female. CRKP was detected in 32 patients (36.4%) and carbapenem-sensitive K.pneumoniae (CSKP) was detected in 56 patients. The presence of OXA-48 was found to be 68.8% in the carbapenem screening test performed by combination disc method in patients with CRKP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that previous use of colistin [Odds ratio (OR)= 19.108; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 2.027-180.133; p= 0.010] and aminoglycoside (OR= 12.189; 95% CI= 1.256-118.334; p= 0.031) was an independent risk factor in terms of CRCP among the patients with K.pneumoniae infection. The 28-day mortality rates were 71.9% in the CRKP group (23/32) and 37.5% in the CSKP group (21/56). Presence of CRKP in terms of 28-day mortality (OR= 5.146; 95% CI= 1.839-14.398; p= 0.002) was an independent risk factor. The data obtained in this study will guide for conducting effective and continuous surveillance studies and implementing rational antibiotic programs to prevent the increase in CRKP."

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to HV-KP is uncommon and details of its clinical and microbiological features are limited. We report the first case of CAP due to capsular genotype K2-ST86 HV-KP in Okinawa, Japan and review infections caused by the K2-ST86 strain. A 79-year-old woman presenting with fever and productive cough persisting for the past three days was admitted to hospital. Her vital signs indicated septic shock. Lung examination by auscultation revealed holo-crackle and lobar pneumonia in chest radiography, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was suspected. However, sputum and blood cultures revealed Gram-negative coccus identified as K. pneumoniae. Genetic analysis identified the isolated strain as the K2 serotype harboring rmpA, iutA, entB, and mrkD. Therefore, we identified the isolated strain as hypervirulent. The isolate belonged to ST86 as determined by multilocus sequence typing. The case was not complicated by predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy related to HV-KP infection; thus, this CAP-causing HV-KP strain may differ from the typical HV-KP strain that induces liver abscess. A literature review identified only nine cases with CAP due to HV-KP. In all cases, the disease mainly occurred in older males with diabetes mellitus, which makes the present case unusual, and had high rates of septic shock and death. No case, including ours, was complicated by metastatic infection, suggesting that CAP due to HV-KP poses little distant metastasis risk, even in patients with bloodstream infection. In our review, consistent with our case, K2-ST86 was the most common strain of HV-KP in patients with CAP. Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and microbiological features of HV-KP CAP, with a focus on the K2-ST86 strain. Physicians should always consider K. pneumoniae in cases of sepsis CAP with lobar pneumonia."

This study was done to determine the common bacterial pathogens, treatment outcomes and associated factors for microbiological confirmed CAP among adults attending the Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure hospital in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods: This was a hospital based cross sectional study involving patients with community acquired pneumonia attending Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure regional Hospital. Demographic and other data were collected using standardized data collection tool. Sputum culture was done followed by identification of the isolates and antibiotics susceptibility testing. Results: A total of 353 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 353 sputum samples, 265(75%) were of good quality. Of 353 non-repetitive sputum cultures, 72/353 (20.4, 95% CI: 16.2-24.6) were positive for the bacterial pathogens with five patients having more than one pathogen. Good quality sputa had significantly higher yield of pathogenic bacteria than poor quality sputa (26.1% vs.3.4%, P = 0.001). The majority 64 (83.1%) of the isolates were gram negative bacteria. Common bacteria isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae 23/77(29.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 10/77 (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9/77 (11.7%) and Escherichia coli 7/77 (9.1%). Of 23 K. pneumoniae isolates, 20/23 (87.0%) were resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ceftriaxone was found to be associated with prolongation of CAP symptoms (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Gram negative bacteria resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were most frequently isolated bacteria among adults' patients with CAP attending BMC and Sekou Toure hospital. Routine sputum culture should be performed to guide appropriate treatment of CAP among adults in developing countries."

Methods: Data of 324 cases with liver cirrhosis from the Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology, the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University were collected, including 217 cases of bacterial pneumonia. Baseline characteristics of the patients, factors affecting the efficacy of antibacterial treatment and prognosis were compared and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to screen and predict the antibacterial efficacy indicators and a prediction model was established. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the value of the established model and Child-Turcortte-Pugh, model for end-stage liver disease, and model for end-stage liver disease combined with serum sodium concentration predict the therapeutic efficacy. Results: Chronic HBV and HCV infections were the main causes of cirrhosis, followed by cryptogenic cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Diabetes, cardio-cerebrovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were susceptible factors for bacterial pneumonia. As infection occurred, the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes, serum C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels had increased significantly. The results of pathogenic analysis showed that the top three pathogenic bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftriaxone was 50.0%, and that of ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefoperazone sulbactam were 27.8%. Imipenem and piperacillin tazobactam containing beta-lactamase inhibitors were the most effective antibacterial therapies. Regression analysis showed that age, procalcitonin, and albumin was significantly correlated with antibacterial effects. The PAA model was established and had predicted the efficacy of Child-Turcortte-Pugh, model for end-stage liver disease, and model for end-stage liver disease combined with serum sodium. The specificity and sensitivity of the PAA was confirmed to be 94.12% and 93.62%, which was significantly higher than other models. Conclusion: The main common pathogenic bacterium of cirrhosis combined with bacterial pneumonia is Klebsiella pneumonia (G-bacilli). In addition, gram positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus) and other are also visible. The elderly, diabetics and patients using hormones are prone to secondary fungal infections. Age, procalcitonin and serum albumin can accurately predict the antibacterial effect, guide clinical treatment and judge the prognosis of the established PAA model."

Parenteral administration of colistin results in poor alveolar penetration and subtherapeutic concentration; therefore, direct drug deposition at site of infection may improve the effectiveness while minimizing the systemic exposure. The aim of this study is to describe the safety and effectiveness of inhaled colistin for the treatment of NP caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens. Method: Patients who received inhaled colistin from May 2015 to May 2019 at 2 different tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were identified from pharmacy databases and their charts were retrospectively reviewed. Results: 86 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 56 +- 20 years. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) was 17 +- 5. The responsible pathogens for NP were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%) Acinetobacter baumannii (28%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%). Most patients (76/86) received concomitant intravenous antibiotics. Mean colistin total daily dose was 6 +- 3 million international units divided into 2-3 doses. Mean inhaled colistin duration of therapy was 11 +- 6 days. Favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 51 (59%) patients while favorable microbiological outcome occurred in 29 (34%) patients. Death due to all causes was noted in 39 (45%) cases. Renal injury occurred in 19 (22%) patients, all received concomitant intravenous colistin. Conclusion: Inhaled colistin can be considered as salvage therapy as adjunct to intravenous administration for treatment of patients with NP due to MDR Gram-negative pathogens."

Thus, research on secondary infections is essential. Here, we review clinical data of secondary bacterial infections developed after the onset of pulmonary viral infections. We review the most recent clinical data and current knowledge of secondary bacterial infections and their treatment in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients; case reports from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 and the best-studied respiratory virus, influenza, are described. We outline treatments used or prophylactic measures employed for secondary bacterial infections. This evaluation includes recent clinical reports of pulmonary viral infections, including those by COVID-19, that reference secondary infections. Where data was provided for COVID-19 patients, a mortality rate of 15.2% due to secondary bacterial infections was observed for patients with pneumonia (41 of 268). Most clinicians treated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections with prophylactic antibiotics (63.7%, n = 1,901), compared to 73.5% (n = 3,072) in all clinical reports of viral pneumonia included in this review. For all cases of viral pneumonia, a mortality rate of 10.9% due to secondary infections was observed (53 of 482). Most commonly, quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides were administered, but also the glycopeptide vancomycin. Several bacterial pathogens appear to be prevalent as causative agents of secondary infections, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae."

However, the positive rate of KP detected from clinical pleural effusion by traditional methods, including bacterial culture, is meager. Therefore, new detection methods are urgently needed to improve the positive detection rate of KP and other bacteria in pleural effusion. METHODS: Simulated pleural fluid of KP infection was first set up. Then circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from cultured hydrothorax and detected by fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to verify KP cfDNA in the pleural fluid. The specificity, sensitivity, and repeatability of this method are verified by detecting the cfDNAs in pleural effusion, samples of malignant pleural effusion, tuberculous pleural effusion, and other common microbial infections. Finally, this method was compared with three traditional methods, pleural effusion, precipitation DNA, sputum culture, and pleural effusion culture to explore the clinical diagnostic value of this method. RESULTS: KP cfDNA was positive by fluorescence PCR from the simulated KP infected pleural effusion, which confirmed KP cfDNA in pleural effusion. KP cfDNA was positive by fluorescence PCR from the pleural effusion of KP infected patients, while with the same detection method, KP cfDNA in clinical carcinomatous hydrothorax, tuberculosis hydrothorax, and other standard microbial infection samples was negative, which confirmed the method had high specificity, high sensitivity, and reproducibility. Compared with the three traditional methods, this method has a higher positive rate. Compared with the gold standard, sputum bacterial culture, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of this method were 91.67%, 95.45%, 91.7%, and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of cfDNA by fluorescence PCR is possible. Moreover, the positive rate of this method in clinical pleural effusions is high."

Rectal colonization with CPE is a risk factor for bacterial translocation leading to subsequent endogenous CPE infections. This prospective observational study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of rectal colonization of CPE, the carbapenemase genotypes, and to identify the independent risk factors for the acquisition of CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards in a university hospital in China. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 150 fecal samples from rectal swabs were consecutively obtained for inpatients from the intensive care unit (ICU) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) wards from November 2018 to May 2019, and screening test for CPE was conducted by using prepared in-house trypsin soybean broth (TSB) selective media and MacConkey agar. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method and carbapenemase genes were characterized by both the GeneXpert Carba-R and PCR for blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM and blaOXA. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to characterize the genetic relationships among the carbapenemase-producing K. Pneumonia (CPKP) isolates. In order to further investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of CPE colonization, a prospective case-control study was also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six suspected CPE strains, including 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1 Enterobacter Kobe, and 1 Raoultella ornithinolytica, were identified in 25 non-duplicated rectal swab samples from 25 patients, with a carriage rate of 16.67% (25/150). Through GeneXpert Carba-R and subsequent PCR and sequencing, all the suspected CPE isolates were identified to be positive for the carbapenemase genes, of which 17 were blaKPC-carriers, and another 9 were blaNDM-producers. MLST designated all the CPKP isolates to be ST11 clone. Multivariate analysis indicated that urinary system diseases, operation of bronchoscopy, and combined use of antibiotics were independent risk factors for acquiring CPE colonization in high-risk patients from the ICU and HSCT wards. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high prevalence of rectal CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards, and a predominant colonization of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae clone ST11. Stricter infection control measures are urgently needed to limit the dissemination of CPE strains, especially in patients who were afflicted by urinary system diseases, have underwent bronchoscopy, and were previously exposed to combined antibiotic use."

Bacterial identification methods such as culture and biochemical tests are routinely used with limited accuracy in many low- and middle-income countries, including Sudan. The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of identification of K. pneumoniae in Khartoum, Sudan. Two hundred and fifty K. pneumoniae isolates were collected and identified using conventional phenotypic methods, biochemically using API 20E and genotypically by amplification of 16S-23S rDNA and sequencing of rpoB, gapA and pgi. Only 139 (55.6 %) of the isolates were confirmed as K. pneumoniae genotypically by PCR and 44.4 % were identified as non- K. pneumoniae . The results demonstrate that the identification panels used by the hospitals were inaccurately identifying K. pneumonia and led to overestimation of the prevalence of this organism. The current identification methods used in Khartoum hospitals are highly inaccurate, and therefore we recommend the use of a comprehensive biochemical panel or molecular methods, when possible, for accurate identification of K. pneumoniae ."

The aim of the study was to analyze the microbial factors of HAIs and the drug resistance of microorganisms to selected antibiotics and their consumption. Material and Methods: The retrospective study included 3708 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Teaching Hospital in Wroclaw, who were diagnosed with 742 HAIs in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018. The aim of the study was the analysis of microorganisms isolated in the respective clinical forms of HAIs, including the occurrence of ""alert pathogens"", presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and consumption of selected antibiotics. Findings: During the study period, 846 microorganisms were cultured in patients with HAIs, and among them, Acinetobacter baumannii MDR represented 31.8%; Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBLs, 11.3%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR, 4.1% and MRSA, 2.2%; and Enterococcus spp. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 1.3%. Among all the pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were dominant (71.6%). Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 21.6% and 7%, respectively. The total number of strains responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central line-associated blood stream infection (CLA-BSI) was as follows: 458 (54.1%), 274 (32.4%), and 114 (13.5%), respectively. Among the etiological factors of VAP, there was a prevalence of A. baumannii MDR (41.9%), as well as in the case of UTI (21.9%). With regards to CLA-BSI, MRCNS (29.8%) was the dominant pathogen. The ""alert pathogens"" accounted for 54.7% of all the analyzed strains. The MDR strains represented 72.6% and 9.7% among A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In the years 2011 vs. 2018, an increase in infections with MDR bacilli was observed, 34.6% vs. 61.0% (p = 0.0008), respectively, including A. baumannii MDR 16.54% vs. 34.56 % (p = 0.0009) and Enterobacterales ESBL+/AMPC 11.8% vs. 15.44 % (p = 0.3921). Resistance to methicillin was confirmed in 35.2% of S. aureus strains. Resistance to vancomycin was found among 30.9% of Enterococcus spp. The observed period was marked by an increase in the consumption of carbapenems: 197.7 vs. 235.9 defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patients-days. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be dominant pathogens in healthcare-associated infections. The most frequently cultured pathogens were multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae ESBL(+), and P. aeruginosa. The study showed an increase in the incidence of ""alert pathogens"" and MDR bacilli, as well as the tendency of a growing resistance to antibiotics during the observed period.

We aim to investigate the epidemiology and the risk factors for CRKP colonization and infections, and to evaluate the application performance of MALDI-TOF MS in clustering CRKP. Results: CRKP colonization and infections incidence was 2.7 (35/1,319,427) per 100,000 patient-days. Inpatients in CRKP group had higher medical expense than CSKP group. Inpatients with underlying conditions, particularly with pulmonary diseases, and with antimicrobial use prior to culture within 30 days, especially with carbapenem use, were risk factors for CRKP acquisition. All CRKP isolates were detected producing KPC-2. The MALDI-TOF MS system and PFGE system provided similar results, with a good concordance between the two methods (adjusted Rand's coefficient, 0.846) and a high probability of MALDI-TOF MS to predict PFGE results (Wallace coefficient, 0.908). Conclusions: Underlying conditions, particularly pulmonary diseases, and antimicrobial use prior to culture within 30 days, especially carbapenem use, are risk factors for CRKP acquisition. Bla KPC-2 is the mainstream gene of CRKP in our geographic area of analysis. As only simple sample preparation is needed and the results can be obtained in a short time, MALDI-TOF MS may be considered a probable alternative to PFGE in clustering KPC-2-producing CRKP."

Results: Among the 734 patients with hematologic malignancies, 3% (22/734) of the patients developed CRKP BSI during their hospitalization. Overall 28-day all-cause mortality reached 77.3% (17/22). Patients with Pitt bacteremia score (PBS) >4, pneumonia and septic shock were more frequent in the non-survivors versus the survivors. Compared with the non-survivors in antimicrobial treatment, combination therapy of tigecycline and polymyxin B was more common in the survivors. The independent risk factors associated with CRKP BSI were CRKP rectal colonization (OR, 11.067; CI=4.43-27.644; P<0.001; 3 points), severe neutropenia (OR, 4.095; CI=0.876-19.141; P=0.073; 1 point) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within the previous 30 days to onset of BSI (OR, 18.444; CI=1.787-190.343; P=0.014; 4 points). The total risk score of >=5 indicated that the probability of CRKP BSI occurrence was above 48%. Conclusion: CRKP BSI in patients with hematologic malignancies is associated with high mortality. The risk factor-based prediction model might help clinicians to start prompt effective anti-infective therapy in patients with suspicion of CRKP BSI and improve outcomes."

METHODS: We conducted a search on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Collaborative database for both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing polymyxin monotherapy versus polymyxin-based combination therapy in patients with CR-KP infection. The primary outcome was mortality. We divided all included studies into several groups according to different combination-combination and different infection types. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for outcome analysis. RESULTS: Ten studies with 481 patients were included. Polymyxin monotherapy was associated with a high mortality than polymyxin-based combination therapy in the treatment of CR-KP bloodstream infections (BSI) (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.14-3.27, P = 0.01) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.15-12.71, P = 0.03). In subgroup analysis of different combination, mortality was significantly higher with polymyxin monotherapy compared with combination therapy with tigecycline (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.05-3.37, P = 0.03), or with cabapenem (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.25-7.74, P = 0.01), but no differences were found in combination with aminoglycosides (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.72-2.29, P = 0.38). Three-drug combination therapy based polymyxin also associated a significant survival benefit (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 1.60-9.32, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Polymyxin-based combination therapy provides significant survival benefit in treatment of CR-KP that appears to be more pronounced when a carbapenem or tigecycline is included in the regimen."

METHODS: For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. CONCLUSION: The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed."

Patients The study participants consisted of 7 crewmembers of the passenger cruise-liner, Diamond Princess, who were admitted to our hospital after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 aboard the ship. Methods The data on patient background and biochemical test results were obtained from the patients' medical records. All patients had a chest X-ray, and a throat swab and sputum samples were sent for culture on admission. Results The median age of the 7 patients, of whom 4 were male and 3 were female, was 39 years (range: 23-47 years). On admission, none of them had fever, but 4 (57%) had a cough. None of them showed any signs of organ damage on laboratory testing. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in one individual, which resolved spontaneously, while the other 6 had normal chest X-ray findings. Culture of throat swabs and sputum samples revealed that 4 patients (57%) had bacterial upper respiratory infections (Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus). The period from a positive PCR test to negative conversion ranged from 5 to 13 days, with a median of 8 days. Conclusion Healthy young adults without risk factors who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an asymptomatic infection or may experience mild COVID-19. In addition to obesity, an older age, underlying illness, and being overweight can lead to a risk of exacerbation; thus, hospital management for such individuals may be desirable. Culturing respiratory samples may be useful for diagnosing secondary bacterial pneumonia."

We aimed to investigate pulmonary manifestations by computed tomography (CT). In total, 100 patients with 117 episodes of pulmonary infection were included. Chest CT scans of every episode were analyzed. Random nodules were the most common findings (79.49%), followed by ground-grass opacities (74.36%), focal consolidations (62.39%), and masses (59.83%). Cavities (12.82%) and multiple small abscesses (17.09%) could be found in the consolidations and masses. CT revealed interstitial pneumonia with tree-in-bud opacities (17.09%), interlobular septal thickening (23.08%) and emphysema (35.04%), which were more severe in the bilateral upper lobes. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (78.63%) and axillary lymphadenopathy (65.81%) were common. Fungal infection (n = 27) was the most common and presented with multiple nodules and masses. Approximately 1/4 of fungal infections had interstitial pneumonia. In Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) infections, large areas of consolidation were common. In tuberculosis infection, the pulmonary infections were more severe and complex. For Bacillus Calmette-Guerin disease, left-sided axillary lymphadenopathy was a characteristic manifestation. CT images of CGD demonstrated variable pulmonary abnormalities. The main infectious organisms have unique imaging features."

METHODS: In this 1.5-year, multicenter, prospective study, we investigated the usefulness of mNGS of BALF for identifying pathogens of SCAP in hospitalized adults, comparing it with other laboratory methods. RESULTS: Of 329 SCAP adults, a microbial etiology was established in 304 cases (92.4%). The overall microbial yield was 90.3% for mNGS versus 39.5% for other methods (P < 0.05). The most frequently detected pathogens in immunocompetent patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.8%), rhinovirus (9.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.7%), and Chlamydia psittaci (8.0%), while in immunocompromised patients they were Pneumocystis jirovecii (44.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%). Notably, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified from two patients solely by mNGS in January 2020; uncommon pathogens including Orientia tsutsugamushi and Nocardia otitidiscaviarum were identified from one patient, respectively. Furthermore, mixed infections were detected in 56.8% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A high microbial detection rate was achieved in SCAP adults using mNGS testing of BALF. The most frequently detected pathogens of SCAP differed between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. mNGS testing may be an powerful tool for early identification of potential pathogens for SCAP to initiate a precise antimicrobial therapy."

We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia)-associated SPE in the emergency department. METHODS: Records of patients with primarily extrapulmonary infection of K. pneumoniae who were admitted to the emergency department between 2014 and 2019 were retrieved. The identifications of K. pneumoniaeassociated SPE were mainly dependent on the clinical manifestations, typical imaging findings, and presence of a primary source of K. pneumoniae infection. RESULTS: A total of 33 cases were identified as SPE with extrapulmonary K. pneumoniae infection. The main clinical manifestations were a febrile/fragile state (100%), respiratory symptoms (18.2%), and digestive symptoms (33.3%). Eight patients (24.2%) developed septic shock, 2 (6.0%) experienced respiratory failure, and 2 (6.0%) complicated endophthalmitis. The major source of infection was liver abscess (n=26, 78.8%), followed by septicemia (n=8, 24.2%), intestinal infection (n=3, 9.1%), and ascites (n=1, 3.0%). The computed tomography (CT) features included the following: peripheral wedge-shaped opacity (n=12, 36.4%), a feeding vessel sign (n=3, 9.1%), multiple nodular lesions (n=5, 15.2%), multifocal lung ill-infiltrations (n=15, 45.5%), patchy ground-glass opacities (n=6, 18.2%), focal consolidations (n=9, 27.3%), lung abscesses (n=4, 12.1%), and pleural effusion (n=21, 63.6%). Re-examination of lung HRCT conducted in 7 patients demonstrated imaging improvement after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumonia-SPE presented special clinical and imaging characteristics, which bear similarities to the signs of pneumonia, but was potentially catastrophic.

METHODS: Twenty MDR-GNB infected patients were retrospectively collected by using electronic medical record systems in West China hospital. RESULTS: For all of the 20 patients, the mean age was 54.5 +- 17.37 years and 14 (70%) were male. Pneumonia (n = 12, 60%), complicated intra-abdominal infection (n = 10, 50%), and bloodstream infection (n = 7, 35%) were the most common infection sources. Klebsiella pneumoniae (18/33) was the predominant pathogen. Fourteen-day clinical cure rate was achieved in 45%. The 14-day and 30-day mortality rates were 25% and 55%, respectively. However, no significant difference was found in 30-day mortality between the treatment of ceftazidime/avibactam monotherapy and combination regimens (p > 0.05). Three patients suffered from adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea.

METHODS: This study included all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the ICU between the period of January 2018 to December 2019. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients in pneumonia were included. Mortality rate was 45.9%. In patients with HAP had higher length of stay days in hospital and ICU, the use of sedative agents, sepsis rate and mortality rate as compared in patients with CAP (for all p<0.05). Microorganism was identified in 27(36.6%) of the patients. Respiratory samples were positive in 25.4% of patients with CAP and 60.8% of patients with HAP. Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent etiologic agents (40.7% and 22.2%, respectively). Acinetobacter baumannii was not susceptible to the third generation cephalosporin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, fluoroquinolone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Among gram-positive bacteria, the most common isolate was staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 75% but these isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The predominance of gram-negative agents was observed in pneumonia patients and due to the high resistance to antibiotics, treatment strategies need to be reconsidered in order to improve the poor prognosis."

From 2010 and 2015, adult cases of monomicrobial bloodstream infections caused by cefepime-susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] <= 8 mg/L) K. pneumoniae isolates with carbapenem resistance were reviewed. Those treated by cefepime were compared with those treated by other active agents (OAA) using a propensity score-matched analysis to assess therapeutic effectiveness. The primary endpoint was 30-day crude mortality. A total of 114 patients experienced cefepime-susceptible CRKP bacteremia and 40 (35.1%) died during hospitalization. Thirty-three (29.0%) patients received cefepime therapy. Fifteen (13.3%) patients acquired bloodstream infections due to carbapenemase-producing isolates, and 86.7% of carbapenemase-producing isolates were classified as the cefepime susceptible-dose-dependent (SDD) category. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 30-day mortality was independently associated with the presence of a critical illness (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 12.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.88-42.83; P < .001), pneumonia (aOR, 5.97; 95% CI, 1.65-21.76; P = .007), and rapidly fatal underlying disease (aOR, 6.43; 95% CI, 1.30-31.09; P = .002). In contrast, cefepime-based therapy (aOR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.003-0.38; P = .006) and combination therapy (aOR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.36; P = .001) were protective against a fatal outcome. Based on current breakpoints for Enterobacterales, cefepime therapy was not associated with an unfavorable outcome for CRKP BSIs with MIC-based dosing strategies. However, the susceptibility result of SDD to cefepime should alert clinicians for possible therapeutic failure."

The purpose of this case series is to state that CMV may lead to severe pneumonia along with other bacteria. METHODOLOGY: CMV pneumonia was diagnosed with the thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan findings, bronchoscopic biopsy, real time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and clinical symptoms. For extraction of CMV DNA from the clinical sample, EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (Qiagen, Germany) was used, and aplification was performed with CMV QS-RGQ Kit (Qiagen, Germany) on Rotor Gene Q 5 Plex HMR (Qiagen, Germany) device. RESULTS: All recipients had severe pneumonia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and at least two-fold increase in transaminases on seventh, twenty-eighth and twenty-second days after surgery, respectively. Thoracic CT scan revealed as diffuse interstitial infiltration in the lung parenchyma. Bronchoscopy, Gram-staining and culture from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed in all of them. During bronchoscopy, a bronchial biopsy was administered to two recipients. One recipient could not be performed procedure because of deep thrombocytopenia. PCR results were positive from serum and BAL fluid. Bronchial biopsy was compatible with CMV pneumonia. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosae was found in two cases and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one case BAL fluid cultures. CONCLUSIONS: CMV pneumonia can be seen simultaneously with bacterial agents due to the indirect effects of the CMV. It should be kept in mind that CMV pneumonia may cause severe clinical courses and can be mortal."

Results: A total of 1 590 cases were collected, including 831 cases from BSI, 450 cases from HAP and 309 cases from IAI. The most prevalent pathogens causing BSI were Escherichia coli (29.2%, 243/831), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%, 135/831) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%, 84/831); the most prevalent pathogens causing IAI were E. coli (26.2%, 81/309), Enterococcus faecium (15.5%, 48/309) and K. pneumoniae (13.3%, 41/309); while Acinetobacter baumanii (24.7%, 111/450), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%, 93/450) and K. pneumoniae (16.2%, 73/450) were dominated in HAP. All S. aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides; 77.8% (105/135) of S. aureus strains were susceptible to ceftaroline. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.6% (40/135) of all the S. aureus, and was lower than the accounted rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) (83.7%, 41/49). One E. faecium strain (1.1%, 1/95) resistant to vacomycin and teicoplanin and one E. faecalis strain (2.3%, 1/43) resistant to linezolid was found. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 56.1% (193/344) in E. coli and 22.1% (55/249) in K. pneumonia; the rate of carbapenem resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 4.1% (14/344) and 22.9% (57/249), respectively; the percentage of ceftazidime/avibactam resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 2.3% (8/344) and 2.0% (5/249), respectively; the percentage of colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 1.5% (5/344) and 7.6% (19/249), respectively; no E. coli and K. pneumonia strains were found resistant to tigecycline. The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa were 78.9% (146/185) and 36.7% (66/180), respectively. A. baumanii showed low susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents except colistin (99.5%, 184/185) and tigecycline (91.4%, 169/185).

The most common bacteria isolated through ETA and BC included Klebsiella species 11 (25.59%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 9 (20.93%), Escherichia coli 7 (16.28%), methicillin-resistant Staph ylo coccus aureus (MRSA) 6 (13.95%), Enterobacter species 5 (11.63%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 (2.32%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (9.30%). The results showed that Enterobacteriaceae isolates from COVID-19 patients had the highest resistance to cotrimoxazole (74%), piperacillin (67.5%), ceftazidime (47.5%), and cefepime (42.5%). All isolates were susceptible to amikacin (100%). S. aureus isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (100%) and the rates of resistance to oxacillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were over (90%). P. aeruginosa was susceptible (90%) to imipenem. Conclusions: Bacterial co-infection is relatively infrequent in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. According to the results, one of the causes of death of these patients could be a secondary infections."

The management of infectious pseudoaneurysm remains controversial. CASE SUMMARY: We reported a 79-year-old man with previous Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary infection and multiple comorbidities who presented with a progressive pulsate mass at the right groin and with right lower limb pain. Computed tomography angiography showed a 6 cm x 6 cm x 9 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery accompanied by occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery. He underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) with stent-graft, and etiology of infectious pseudoaneurysm was confirmed. Then, 3-mo antibiotic therapy was given. One-year follow-up showed the stent-graft was patent and complete removal of surrounding hematoma. CONCLUSION: The femoral artery pseudoaneurysm can be caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae deriving from the pulmonary infection. Moreover, this unusual case highlights the use of EVT and prolonged antibiotic therapy for infectious pseudoaneurysm."

The clinical course and the underlying immunity of the host contribute to the development of secondary bacterial infections in the infected patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims at analyzing the secondary bacterial infections in confirmed H1N1 cases admitted in our hospital (from 2015 to 2018) with respect to the comorbidities, complications, associated bacteria with its antibiotic susceptibility pattern and the outcome of such episodes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 164 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital with H1N1 was extracted from medical records using a semi-structured case report form. Data was entered and analyzed with SPSS version 17. A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Most patients were aged above 40 years with female preponderance. In our study 42% of patients had comorbidities. Only 14 (8.53%) had secondary bacterial infection confirmed by culture. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common bacteria that were isolated. They were treated based on the culture reports. There was no mortality in patients with secondary bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: The early start of the antiviral agents and adherence to the antibiotic policy of the hospital contributed to lower secondary bacterial infections and zero mortality."

The aim of this study was to report our experience with colonization/infection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) and Candida auris among critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). All COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs at San Martino Policlinico Hospital-IRCCS in Genoa, Italy, were screened from 28 February to 31 May 2020. One-hundred and eighteen patients admitted to COVID-19 ICUs were included in the study. Among them, 12 (10.2%) became colonized/infected with CRPA, 6 (5.1%) with C. auris and 2 (1.6%) with CR-Kp. All patients with CRPA received prior treatment with meropenem, and in 11 (91.7%) infection was not preceded by colonization. Four patients (66.7%) developed C. auris candidemia. A significant spread of resistant pathogens was observed among critically ill COVID-19 patients. Dedicated strategies are warranted to prevent horizontal spread and maintain effective antimicrobial stewardship programs in the setting of COVID-19 care."

K. pneumoniae infection in pregnancy, leading to acute chorioamnionitis (AC), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and early pregnancy loss in the second trimester, has been rarely reported. Herein, we present a case of K. pneumoniae AC that caused intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) at 19 weeks + 5 days. The 36-year-old mother was admitted at 18 weeks + 1 day of gestation for threatened abortion. IUFD occurred 11 days after. Fetal postmortem showed severe AC and funisitis, neutrophils within alveoli and intestinal lumen, associated with rod-like bacteria. Fetal blood and lung cultures grew K. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-non-producing strain. Antibiogram revealed sensitivity for piperacillin/tazobactam. Three days after IUFD, the mother presented with fever (37.8  C) which persisted for one week. Maternal blood and urine cultures were negative. According to fetal microbiological results, available 6 days after IUFD, initial treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced with piperacillin/tazobactam with full patient recovery. Therefore, in the event of PPROM and IUFD, fetal microbiological investigations should always be performed to isolate the proper etiologic agent and start the correct medical treatment."

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

AIM: To determine and analyze the incidence, risk factors and etiologic agents of NI in newborns admitted in the NICU to help plan-ning future surveillance and prevention strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out at the NICU of St George University Hospital, Plovdiv, Bul-garia from January 1, 2017 to June 31, 2018. The number of neonates included in the study was 507. Descriptive statistics such as count,  percent, mean and standard deviation was used. Chi-square test was performed to prove associations. Odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were computed from the results of the binominal logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 507 hospitalized newborns in NICU, 48 presented with 54 NI. The incidence and the density incidence rates were 9.5% and 7.67 per 1,000 patient-days, respectively. Nosocomial infections were detected in neonates from all birth weight (BW) classes, but it was low BW and premature neonates that were at major risk to acquire them. The most common infection sites were ventilator-asso-ciated pneumonia (VAP) (67.27%), bloodstream infection (23.64%) and conjunctivitis (9.09%). Major pathogens were Gram-negative such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis NIs were strongly associated with intubation, presence of a venous catheter, the duration of antibiotic treatment and increased CRP> 10 mg/l. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the burden of NIs, identifies the major focus for future NI control and prevention programs."

However, clinical information with respect to its utilization in infection caused by ESBL producers is limited. The aim of this study was a comparison of mortality rates of loading dose (LD) colistin and carbapenems as definitive therapies in a cohort of patients with infections caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A retrospective cohort study in 396 patients with ESBL-producing E.coli and K.pneumoniae infection at a university-affiliated hospital was conducted between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2015 to compare outcomes of infected patients who received LD colistin (95 patients) with carbapenems (301 patients). The three primary outcomes were 30-day mortality, clinical response and microbiological response. The most common infection types were urinary tract infection (49.49%), followed by pneumonia (40.66%), bacteremia (13.64%), skin and soft tissue infections (4.80%) and intra-abdominal infection (3.03%). LD colistin group provided higher 30-day mortality when compared with carbapenems group (HR 7.97; 95% CI 3.68 to 17.25; P = 0.001). LD colistin was also independently associated with clinical failure (HR 4.30; 95% CI 1.93 to 9.57; P = 0.001) and bacteriological failure (HR 9.49; 95% CI 3.76 to 23.96; P = 0.001) when compared with those who received carbapenems. LD colistin treatment was associated with poorer outcomes, i.e. mortality rate, clinical response and microbiological response. Moreover, when adjusted confounding factors, LD colistin was still less effective than carbapenems. It should be noted that, however, the use of Vitek-2 to assess colistin susceptibility could provide inaccurate results. Also, the difference in baseline characteristics could still remain in retrospective study although compensation by hazard ratio adjustment was performed. Therefore, clinical utilization of LD colistin should be recommended as an alternative for treatment ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae only in the circumstances where carbapenems cannot be utilized, but this recommendation must be considered carefully."

However, clinical data regarding the epidemiology of VAP in China are limited. Methods: A multicenter, longitudinal, observational study was performed from March 2013 to December 2015 to prospectively collect data on patients diagnosed with VAP. Specifically, patients supported by invasive mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 hours were included. Clinical data were recorded for each VAP patient. The exact pathogen distribution and the incidence of VAP were calculated. Risk factors associated with mortality were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results: A total of 2492 patients received mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 hours and were enrolled in the study. A total of 129 (5.0%) patients fulfilled the VAP criteria, and 38 (29.5%) patients were diagnosed with early-onset VAP. The incidence of VAP was 4.5 per 1000 ventilation days, with a 28-day mortality rate of 45%. Individual pathogens, including 115 bacteria and 2 fungi, were identified in 117 (90.7%) enrollees, and 87 (75.7%) bacteria were multidrug-resistant organisms. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most commonly detected pathogens causing VAP. No difference in the distribution of pathogens was observed between early- and late-onset VAP or between surviving and non-surviving patients. Multivariate regression revealed that older ages and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Scores were correlated with increased 28-day mortality rates. Conclusions: High pathogen resistance and mortality were found in both early- and late-onset VAP. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01943331."

METHODS: 234 patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours admitted to ICU of Shexian People's Hospital of Huangshan City from January 2016 to June 2018 were enrolled. The clinical data of all patients including gender, age, past medical history, exposure to antibiotics, medication, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, serum albumin, tracheotomy, re-intubation, prognosis, and pathogenic bacteria and drug sensitivity test of VAP patients were collected. The patients were divided into VAP group and non-VAP group according to the occurrence of VAP. The differences of each index between the two groups were compared. The risk factors of VAP were analyzed by multivariate Logistic regression. The distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in sputum culture of lower respiratory tract of VAP patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 234 patients on mechanical ventilation, 95 patients had VAP, and the incidence of VAP was 40.60%. (1) Risk factors of VAP: it was shown by univariate analysis that there were significant differences between VAP patients and non-VAP patients in past history, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay, albumin &lt; 28 g/L, antibiotic exposure and tracheotomy, but there were no significant differences in gender, age, glucocorticoid, sedative, gastric motility and coma between the two groups. It was shown by multivariate Logistic regression analysis that brain injury and cerebrovascular accident, the duration of mechanical ventilation &gt; 7 days, albumin &lt; 28 g/L and tracheotomy were independent risk factors for VAP occurrence [brain injury: odds ratio (OR) = 41.40, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 2.14-799.60, P = 0.014; cerebrovascular accident: OR = 36.07, 95%CI = 1.86-699.64, P = 0.018; the duration of mechanical ventilation &gt; 7 days: OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.11-1.36, P &lt; 0.001; albumin &lt; 28 g/L: OR = 2.27, 95%CI = 1.03-5.01, P = 0.042; tracheotomy: OR = 3.33, 95%CI = 1.30-8.56, P = 0.012]. (2) Distribution and drug resistance of VAP pathogens: a total of 108 strains of pathogens were isolated from sputum samples of 95 patients with VAP. Gram-negative (G-) bacteria accounted for 86.11% (93/108). The isolation rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was the highest, reaching 31.48% (34/108); the isolation rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii were 22.22% (24/108), 8.33% (9/108) and 9.26% (10/108), respectively. Gram-positive (G+) bacteria accounted for 6.48% (7/108), of which Staphylococcus aureus was 4.63% (5/108); and fungi was 7.41% (8/108). Drug resistance analysis showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100% sensitive to amikacin (AMK), meropenem (MEM) and polymyxin (POL), and were suggested as the preferred drug. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% sensitive to AMK, tobramycin (TOB) and POL, but 100% resistant to compound trimethoprim (PCST). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was 100% sensitive to PCST and 100% resistant to AMK, piperacillin (PIP), piperacillin tazobactam (TZP) and TOB. Acinetobacter baumannii was 100% sensitive to cefoxitin (FOX), cefuroxime (CXM) and POT. Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to gentamicin (GEN), furantoin (NIT), rifampicin (RIF), vancomycin (VAN) and teicoplanin (TEC), while the drug resistance to clindamycin (CLI) and penicillin (PEN) was high (both 80.00%). Most pathogens were multidrug-resistant. The mortality of patients with multidrug resistant bacteria infection was significantly higher than that of non-multidrug resistant bacteria infection [51.85% (28/52) vs. 30.56% (11/36), chi 2 = 4.240, P = 0.046].

The major causes of pneumonia in neurologic patients may differ from those in the general population, resulting in a different pathogen distribution. We investigated the trends of pathogen distribution in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients and the related antibiotic resistance in those with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: A retrospective study was performed at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea. Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology with a positive respiratory specimen culture between 2007 and 2016 were included. Pneumonia events in patients were screened by chronologically associating the date of respiratory specimen acquisition for culture studies and the date of antibiotics administration. Subgroup analyses regarding multidrug resistance in HAP were performed in different pneumonia categories, by presence of &gt;=1 risk factor and by time period (first half vs. second half of study period). Microbial resistance profiles of isolates from patients with pneumonia were analyzed. Results: We identified 351 pneumonia cases in 227 patients involving 36 different pathogens. 232 cases were HAP, of which 70 cases were intensive care unit (ICU)-HAP. The leading pathogens were Stapylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, which were isolated in 133 (37.9%), 72 (20.5%), 55 (15.7%), 44 (12.5%), 33 (9.4%), and 27 (7.7%) cases, respectively. Cases with HAP showed a higher proportion of P. aeruginosa and a lower proportion of S. pneumoniae (both, p &lt; 0.05) than those with non-HAP. ICU-HAP isolates showed a higher multidrug resistance (MDR) rate than non-ICU-HAP isolates (p &lt; 0.005) in those with &gt;=1 MDR risk factor. Non-susceptibility to imipenem (p &lt; 0.0005), piperacillin-tazobactam (p &lt; 0.001), cefepime (p &lt; 0.005), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (p &lt; 0.05) in Gram-negative pathogens increased over time in both ICU and non-ICU settings. Conclusions: S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, and E. aerogenes were the leading isolates in culture-positive pneumonia in hospitalized neurologic patients.

Studies focusing on S. aureus pneumonia in DM is limited, we sought to make a relatively comprehensive exploration of clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, and risk factors for mortality of S. aureus pneumonia in DM and non-diabetics mellitus (non-DM). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in Ruijin Hospital from 2014 to 2017. The characteristics of DM and non-DM patients were assessed, including demographics, comorbidities, using of invasive mechanical ventilation, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age &gt;=65 years (CURB-65) score, length of hospital stay, clinical outcomes, antimicrobial susceptibility. Independent risk factors for mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 patients with S. aureus pneumonia were included in our study, including 144 with DM and 221 non-DM. DM patients were more susceptible to MRSA infection (65.3% vs. 56.1%, P &gt; 0.05), suffered from much severer pneumonia with a higher CURB-65 score, invasive mechanical ventilation rate (46.5% vs. 28.1%, P &lt; 0.01) and mortality rates (30.6% vs. 23.1%, P &gt; 0.05); almost all DM patients had higher antimicrobial resistance than non-DM patients, the DM group had a higher co-infection rate (47.2% vs. 45.7%, P &gt; 0.05), and Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common bacterium in DM, while Klebsiella pneumoniae ranked first in patients with non-DM. Independent risk factors for pneumonia-related mortality were MRSA and CURB-65. Higher HbA1c levels were linked to a higher MRSA infection and co-infection rate and more severe pneumonia, leading to an increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: DM patients with poor glucose control are more susceptible to MRSA infection. They suffer from higher antimicrobial resistance, a higher co-infection rate, and much severer pneumonia than non-DM. MRSA itself is an independent risk factor for mortality in all patients."

The increase in multi-drug resistant bacteria has not been accompanied by the validation of new drugs, or by any new antimicrobial strategies to exploit the available agents. VAP due to Gram-negative bacteria has increased mortality, both due to the resistant pathogens themselves and due to inappropriate treatment. Local epidemiology, patients' characteristics and clinical responses provide the most important information for therapeutic decision-making. Moreover, data on VAP therapy due to resistant bacteria are lacking, and the choice of treatment is often based on clinical practice and individual experience. Areas covered: This review summarizes the strategies available for treating the three most prevalent resistant Gram-negative organisms causing VAP: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. The review covers the results of a Pubmed search, clinical practice guidelines and reviews, and the authors' experience. Expert opinion: The existing evidence focuses on bloodstream infections or other sites rather than pneumonia and there are no recommendations for the treatment of VAP by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, especially for combination regimens. The approval of new drugs is needed to provide effective and safe alternatives for treating carbapenemase-producing strains. Precision medicine and personalized approach are also fundamental in future research."

Bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated with this infection varied between geographical regions. Knowledge of the pathogens in a given area and their up-to-date AMR profile is essential for optimal management of patients. This study was aimed at assessing the type of bacterial isolates and their AMR among CAP adult patients at the Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 April to 30 July 2018. Demographic related data were collected from the study participants using a structured questionnaire. Sputum samples were collected and processed to identify pathogens using the conventional culture and biochemical tests as per the standard procedures. The Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method was implemented for the AMR testing. Descriptive and multivariable analysis was conducted using SPSS version 23. Results: Among 414 presumptively diagnosed study participants for CAP, bacterial pathogens were identified from 167 (40.3%) participants. Among these, multidrug resistance (MDR) accounted for 127(76%) of the isolates. The predominant isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae at 60(35.9%) and Klebsella pneumoniae at 30(18%). Overcrowded living conditions [AOR 1.579 (95%CI: 1.015-2.456)] and alcohol use [AOR 4.043 (95% CI, 2.537-6.443)] were found statistically associated with culture positive sputum. Conclusions: The study showed high prevalence of mono- and multi-drug resistant isolates in the study area. Therefore, regular surveillance of the type of isolates and their AMR patterns should be considered. Interventions for reducing community acquired pneumonia should be integrated with lifestyle factors related to household and alcohol use."

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae causing pneumonia at a large teaching hospital in China. METHODS: We collected patient's clinical data and ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains causing pneumonia (from December 2015 to June 2016) at a hospital in Wuhan. The susceptibilities, multi-locus sequence typing, homologous analysis, ESBL genes by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were determined. RESULTS: A total of 59 ESBL-producing strains (31 E. coli and 28 K. pneumoniae) isolated from patients with pneumonia were analyzed. The majority of strains were isolated from patients were with hospital-acquired pneumonia (37/59, 62.7%), followed by community-acquired pneumonia (13/59, 22.0%), and ventilator-related pneumonia (9/59, 15.3%). The E. coli ST131 (9 isolates, 29.0%) and K. pneumoniae ST11 (5 isolates, 17.9%) were the predominant sub-types. The most prevalent ESBL gene was CTX-M-14, followed by SHV-77, CTX-M-3, SHV-11, and CTX-M-27. At least 33 (55.9%) of the ESBL-producing strains carried two or more ESBL genes. The ISEcp1 and IS26 were found upstream of all blaCTX-M (CTX-Ms) and of most blaSHV (SHVs) (57.6%), respectively. Moreover, three ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 strains which were resistant to carbapenems carried the blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2, two of which also bearing blaOXA-48 were resistant to all antibiotics (including Tigecycline). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired pneumonia is more likely correlated with ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. ESBL-producing E. coli ST131 and multi-drug resistance ESBL-producing, as well as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases-2 (KPC-2) bearing K. pneumoniae ST11 are spreading in patients with pneumonia in hospital."

We describe a case of sustained and severe hypoglycemia in a patient treated with tigecycline for pneumonia due to MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old man was admitted for treatment of pneumonia. At admission he had prediabetes. In the hospital he developed renal failure. On day 3, the patient experienced severe shortness of breath. He was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilator support. In the ICU the antibiotic regimen was cefoperazone and sulbactam (1 g every 12 h). Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy was started on that day. Test for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) was positive, and so the nephrologist and rheumatologist agreed on a diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, with renal and pulmonary involvement and acute renal failure. Plasmapheresis, and high-dose methylprednisolone treatment were started on day 6, and there was obvious improvement in the patient's condition. The steroid regimen was gradually tapered to oral prednisone (35 mg every day) on day 19. Afterwards, the patient's pneumonia worsened. Sputum culture showed Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to only tigecycline. Tigecycline treatment (100 mg every 12 h) was administered on day 20. Hypoglycemia started about 37 h after the first dose of tigecycline. Infusion of 50% glucose through the femoral vein was required for over 20 h to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. Tigecycline was stopped, but the hypoglycemia resolved only after a further 34 h. The insulin and C-peptide levels were found to be markedly elevated during the hypoglycemia. The Naranjo scale score of 7 indicated that the likelihood of tigecycline causing severe hypoglycemia was ""probable."" CONCLUSION: This is the first report of sustained severe hypoglycemia due to tigecycline. Oversecretion of insulin appears to have been the cause of the hypoglycemia in our patient. The mechanism needs to be investigated."

Patients with Klebsiella pneumonia infection were stratified into two groups based on the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). MLR was calculated by dividing monocytes count by lymphocytes count obtained from routine blood examination. The area under the curve (AUC) values was determined using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between the variables was tested with Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between MLR and the severity of Klebsiella pneumonia infection.One hundred fifty-two patients were finally enrolled for analysis. Among those, 43 (28.29%) cases had severe KPI. MLR was found to be an independent risk factor of the serious Klebsiella pneumonia infection (OR: 23.74, 95% CI: 5.41-104.11, P &lt; .001). Besides, MLR was positively correlated with NEWS score (r = 0.57, P &lt; .001). In the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, MLR, with an optimal cut-off value of 0.665, predicted the severe coronary lesion with a sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 84.4%.MLR was an independent predictor of the severe Klebsiella pneumonia infection.

Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed or because of unrecognition of the pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managing in general wards. METHODS: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 h were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study. RESULTS: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood culture than patients with non-severe CAP (24% VS 4.5%; p = .008). Initial antibiotic treatment were discordant with the IDSA/ATS guidelines in 42% of all patients hospitalized with CAP, and 52% of patients with severe CAP. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and initial antibiotic treatment discordant to guidelines for severe CAP in ICU (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3-17.1) were independent risk factors of the unfavorable outcome of patients with severe CAP. Patients with unfavorable outcome had lower number of hospital-free days than patients with favorable outcome (5.2 +- 8 days VS 18 +- 7.1 days; p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes."

Klebsiella spp. are major pathogens in healthcare-associated infections, and their importance is increasing. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of Klebsiella spp. chest infections by evaluating the differences in the characteristics of chest infections caused by Klebsiella spp. and pneumoniae. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients hospitalized with pneumonia, lung abscess/necrotizing pneumonia, and empyema due to Klebsiella spp. and S. pneumoniae for 15 years at our institution in Saitama, Japan. Patients Patients with chest infections due to Klebsiella spp. (K group, n=76) and S. pneumoniae (S group, n=446) were included. Results The K group more frequently was male, older, coinfected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and had diabetes mellitus, a history of upper digestive system surgery, alcohol drinking habit, a smoking habit, and an impaired premorbid performance status than the S group. The percentages of lung abscesses or necrotizing pneumonia (31.6% vs. 0.9%) and empyema without pulmonary parenchymal shadow (3.9% vs. 0.7%) were higher in the K group than those in the S group. Severity on admission and mortality did not differ between the groups; however, patients in the K group required a longer duration of antibiotics administration and hospital stay than those in the S group. Conclusion Klebsiella spp. chest infections have some marked characteristics when compared with pneumococcal infections, and our results serve to differentiate Klebsiella spp. infection from pneumococcal infection."

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics."

During a two-month study period, 154 (mean age: 75.2 ++ 12.2 years; 94 males) out of 620 (24.8%) hospitalized patients underwent 174 blood cultures and were enrolled in the study. The rate of true-positive cultures was 11.5% (20/174) and the rate of false-positive (contaminants) was 5.7% (10/174). A total of 23 microorganisms (5 multidrug resistant strains), most frequently Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), were isolated. The positivity rate was significantly higher in patients with urinary tract infection (31%) and abdomen infection (26.1%) than in patients with pneumonia (4.9%; p<0.01). Although the positivity rate in patients exposed to antibiotics was lower than in those not exposed, the difference was not statistically significant. Therapy changes due to blood culture positivity were observed in 7.1% of the patients overall. In-hospital death was observed in nine of the 136 patients with negative blood cultures (6.6%) and in none of the 18 patients with positive blood cultures. These results indicate that the yield and clinical impact of blood cultures is quite low in patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward and suggest the need to improve the adequacy of the indications to perform the test."

Among these, sporadic hvKp-related community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an acute-onset, rapidly progressing disease that can likely turn fatal, if left untreated. However, the clinical diagnosis of hvKp infection remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms, lack of awareness regarding this disease, and no consensus definition of hvKp. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old man presented with high-grade fever and sudden-onset chest pain. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 11,600 cells/mul and C-reactive protein level (>32 mg/dl). A chest X-ray and computed tomography revealed a focal consolidation in the left lower lung field. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of fulminant CAP caused by a hvKp K2-ST86 strain was made based upon multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. OUTCOMES: The pneumonia became fulminant. Despite intensive care and treatment, he eventually died 15.5 hours after admission. LESSONS: This is the first case of fatal fulminant CAP caused by a hvKp K2-ST86 strain reported in Japan. MLST was extremely useful for providing a definitive diagnosis for this infection. Thus, we propose that a biomarker-based approach should be considered even for an exploratory diagnosis of CAP related to hvKp infection."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lower BI scores, basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are independent risk factors of pneumonia among convalescent patients with stroke. The main pathogens that caused pneumonia were gram-negative bacteria, and such organisms have different degrees of resistance to drugs."

The biggest problem in infections with K.pneumoniae is that treatment options are limited due to multiple antibiotic resistance and consequently the increased morbidity and mortality. The widespread and improper use of carbapenems can lead to epidemics that are difficult to control, especially in intensive care units because of the acquired resistance to this group of antibiotics. Outbreaks and sporadic cases caused by carbapenem resistant K.pneumoniae (CRKP) species have been reported all over the world in recent years with increased frequency. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors related to carbepenem resistance and mortality caused by K.pneumoniae infections in a university hospital anesthesia intensive care unit. The study was conducted between January 1st, 2016, and December 31st, 2018. Retrospective data were obtained from the patient and laboratory-based surveillance records. Adult patients (>= 18 years) with K.pneumoniae growth in the blood, urine, abscess and tracheal aspirate samples collected 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit were considered as the relevant infection locus-related agent and treated with antibacterial therapy. Clinical samples collected from patients were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood and eosin-methylene-blue (EMB) agar except the blood samples. Blood samples were cultured in blood culture bottles and incubated in an automated system. Gram staining was performed for the samples showing growth signal within five days and then inoculated onto 5% sheep blood and EMB agar media and were incubated for 18-24 hours at 35.5-37 C. Identification of the isolates was performed using Bruker IVD MALDI Biotyper 2.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Almanya) based on ""matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)"". K.pneumoniae isolates were identified by obtaining reliability scores of 2.0 and above in the study. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed with Phoenix 100 (BD, New Jersey, ABD) automated system. Interpretations were made according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. Combination disk diffusion test and polymerase chain reaction based tests were used to show the presence of carbapenemase in CRKP isolates. A total of 88 patients with K.pneumoniae infection were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 74 +- 15 (range= 21-93) years and 60.2% were female. CRKP was detected in 32 patients (36.4%) and carbapenem-sensitive K.pneumoniae (CSKP) was detected in 56 patients. The presence of OXA-48 was found to be 68.8% in the carbapenem screening test performed by combination disc method in patients with CRKP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that previous use of colistin [Odds ratio (OR)= 19.108; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 2.027-180.133; p= 0.010] and aminoglycoside (OR= 12.189; 95% CI= 1.256-118.334; p= 0.031) was an independent risk factor in terms of CRCP among the patients with K.pneumoniae infection. The 28-day mortality rates were 71.9% in the CRKP group (23/32) and 37.5% in the CSKP group (21/56). Presence of CRKP in terms of 28-day mortality (OR= 5.146; 95% CI= 1.839-14.398; p= 0.002) was an independent risk factor. The data obtained in this study will guide for conducting effective and continuous surveillance studies and implementing rational antibiotic programs to prevent the increase in CRKP."

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to HV-KP is uncommon and details of its clinical and microbiological features are limited. We report the first case of CAP due to capsular genotype K2-ST86 HV-KP in Okinawa, Japan and review infections caused by the K2-ST86 strain. A 79-year-old woman presenting with fever and productive cough persisting for the past three days was admitted to hospital. Her vital signs indicated septic shock. Lung examination by auscultation revealed holo-crackle and lobar pneumonia in chest radiography, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was suspected. However, sputum and blood cultures revealed Gram-negative coccus identified as K. pneumoniae. Genetic analysis identified the isolated strain as the K2 serotype harboring rmpA, iutA, entB, and mrkD. Therefore, we identified the isolated strain as hypervirulent. The isolate belonged to ST86 as determined by multilocus sequence typing. The case was not complicated by predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy related to HV-KP infection; thus, this CAP-causing HV-KP strain may differ from the typical HV-KP strain that induces liver abscess. A literature review identified only nine cases with CAP due to HV-KP. In all cases, the disease mainly occurred in older males with diabetes mellitus, which makes the present case unusual, and had high rates of septic shock and death. No case, including ours, was complicated by metastatic infection, suggesting that CAP due to HV-KP poses little distant metastasis risk, even in patients with bloodstream infection. In our review, consistent with our case, K2-ST86 was the most common strain of HV-KP in patients with CAP. Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and microbiological features of HV-KP CAP, with a focus on the K2-ST86 strain. Physicians should always consider K. pneumoniae in cases of sepsis CAP with lobar pneumonia."

Identification of the pathogens is crucial in the management of CAP. This study was done to determine the common bacterial pathogens, treatment outcomes and associated factors for microbiological confirmed CAP among adults attending the Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure hospital in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods: This was a hospital based cross sectional study involving patients with community acquired pneumonia attending Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure regional Hospital. Demographic and other data were collected using standardized data collection tool. Sputum culture was done followed by identification of the isolates and antibiotics susceptibility testing. Results: A total of 353 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 353 sputum samples, 265(75%) were of good quality. Of 353 non-repetitive sputum cultures, 72/353 (20.4, 95% CI: 16.2-24.6) were positive for the bacterial pathogens with five patients having more than one pathogen. Good quality sputa had significantly higher yield of pathogenic bacteria than poor quality sputa (26.1% vs.3.4%, P = 0.001). The majority 64 (83.1%) of the isolates were gram negative bacteria. Common bacteria isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae 23/77(29.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 10/77 (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9/77 (11.7%) and Escherichia coli 7/77 (9.1%). Of 23 K. pneumoniae isolates, 20/23 (87.0%) were resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ceftriaxone was found to be associated with prolongation of CAP symptoms (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Gram negative bacteria resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were most frequently isolated bacteria among adults' patients with CAP attending BMC and Sekou Toure hospital. Routine sputum culture should be performed to guide appropriate treatment of CAP among adults in developing countries."

Parenteral administration of colistin results in poor alveolar penetration and subtherapeutic concentration; therefore, direct drug deposition at site of infection may improve the effectiveness while minimizing the systemic exposure. The aim of this study is to describe the safety and effectiveness of inhaled colistin for the treatment of NP caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens. Method: Patients who received inhaled colistin from May 2015 to May 2019 at 2 different tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were identified from pharmacy databases and their charts were retrospectively reviewed. Results: 86 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 56 +- 20 years. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) was 17 +- 5. The responsible pathogens for NP were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%) Acinetobacter baumannii (28%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%). Most patients (76/86) received concomitant intravenous antibiotics. Mean colistin total daily dose was 6 +- 3 million international units divided into 2-3 doses. Mean inhaled colistin duration of therapy was 11 +- 6 days. Favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 51 (59%) patients while favorable microbiological outcome occurred in 29 (34%) patients. Death due to all causes was noted in 39 (45%) cases. Renal injury occurred in 19 (22%) patients, all received concomitant intravenous colistin. Conclusion: Inhaled colistin can be considered as salvage therapy as adjunct to intravenous administration for treatment of patients with NP due to MDR Gram-negative pathogens."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%. The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem increased annually. The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones, Aminoglycosides were <5% even when compared to carbapenems. Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

However, the positive rate of KP detected from clinical pleural effusion by traditional methods, including bacterial culture, is meager. Therefore, new detection methods are urgently needed to improve the positive detection rate of KP and other bacteria in pleural effusion. METHODS: Simulated pleural fluid of KP infection was first set up. Then circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from cultured hydrothorax and detected by fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to verify KP cfDNA in the pleural fluid. The specificity, sensitivity, and repeatability of this method are verified by detecting the cfDNAs in pleural effusion, samples of malignant pleural effusion, tuberculous pleural effusion, and other common microbial infections. Finally, this method was compared with three traditional methods, pleural effusion, precipitation DNA, sputum culture, and pleural effusion culture to explore the clinical diagnostic value of this method. RESULTS: KP cfDNA was positive by fluorescence PCR from the simulated KP infected pleural effusion, which confirmed KP cfDNA in pleural effusion. KP cfDNA was positive by fluorescence PCR from the pleural effusion of KP infected patients, while with the same detection method, KP cfDNA in clinical carcinomatous hydrothorax, tuberculosis hydrothorax, and other standard microbial infection samples was negative, which confirmed the method had high specificity, high sensitivity, and reproducibility. Compared with the three traditional methods, this method has a higher positive rate. Compared with the gold standard, sputum bacterial culture, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of this method were 91.67%, 95.45%, 91.7%, and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of cfDNA by fluorescence PCR is possible. Moreover, the positive rate of this method in clinical pleural effusions is high."

Rectal colonization with CPE is a risk factor for bacterial translocation leading to subsequent endogenous CPE infections. This prospective observational study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of rectal colonization of CPE, the carbapenemase genotypes, and to identify the independent risk factors for the acquisition of CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards in a university hospital in China. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 150 fecal samples from rectal swabs were consecutively obtained for inpatients from the intensive care unit (ICU) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) wards from November 2018 to May 2019, and screening test for CPE was conducted by using prepared in-house trypsin soybean broth (TSB) selective media and MacConkey agar. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method and carbapenemase genes were characterized by both the GeneXpert Carba-R and PCR for blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaVIM and blaOXA. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to characterize the genetic relationships among the carbapenemase-producing K. Pneumonia (CPKP) isolates. In order to further investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of CPE colonization, a prospective case-control study was also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six suspected CPE strains, including 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1 Enterobacter Kobe, and 1 Raoultella ornithinolytica, were identified in 25 non-duplicated rectal swab samples from 25 patients, with a carriage rate of 16.67% (25/150). Through GeneXpert Carba-R and subsequent PCR and sequencing, all the suspected CPE isolates were identified to be positive for the carbapenemase genes, of which 17 were blaKPC-carriers, and another 9 were blaNDM-producers. MLST designated all the CPKP isolates to be ST11 clone. Multivariate analysis indicated that urinary system diseases, operation of bronchoscopy, and combined use of antibiotics were independent risk factors for acquiring CPE colonization in high-risk patients from the ICU and HSCT wards. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high prevalence of rectal CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and HSCT wards, and a predominant colonization of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae clone ST11. Stricter infection control measures are urgently needed to limit the dissemination of CPE strains, especially in patients who were afflicted by urinary system diseases, have underwent bronchoscopy, and were previously exposed to combined antibiotic use."

Bacterial identification methods such as culture and biochemical tests are routinely used with limited accuracy in many low- and middle-income countries, including Sudan. The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of identification of K. pneumoniae in Khartoum, Sudan. Two hundred and fifty K. pneumoniae isolates were collected and identified using conventional phenotypic methods, biochemically using API 20E and genotypically by amplification of 16S-23S rDNA and sequencing of rpoB, gapA and pgi. Only 139 (55.6 %) of the isolates were confirmed as K. pneumoniae genotypically by PCR and 44.4 % were identified as non- K. pneumoniae . The results demonstrate that the identification panels used by the hospitals were inaccurately identifying K. pneumonia and led to overestimation of the prevalence of this organism. The current identification methods used in Khartoum hospitals are highly inaccurate, and therefore we recommend the use of a comprehensive biochemical panel or molecular methods, when possible, for accurate identification of K. pneumoniae ."

The aim of the study was to analyze the microbial factors of HAIs and the drug resistance of microorganisms to selected antibiotics and their consumption. Material and Methods: The retrospective study included 3708 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Teaching Hospital in Wroclaw, who were diagnosed with 742 HAIs in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018. The aim of the study was the analysis of microorganisms isolated in the respective clinical forms of HAIs, including the occurrence of ""alert pathogens"", presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and consumption of selected antibiotics. Findings: During the study period, 846 microorganisms were cultured in patients with HAIs, and among them, Acinetobacter baumannii MDR represented 31.8%; Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBLs, 11.3%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR, 4.1% and MRSA, 2.2%; and Enterococcus spp. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 1.3%. Among all the pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were dominant (71.6%). Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 21.6% and 7%, respectively. The total number of strains responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central line-associated blood stream infection (CLA-BSI) was as follows: 458 (54.1%), 274 (32.4%), and 114 (13.5%), respectively. Among the etiological factors of VAP, there was a prevalence of A. baumannii MDR (41.9%), as well as in the case of UTI (21.9%). With regards to CLA-BSI, MRCNS (29.8%) was the dominant pathogen. The ""alert pathogens"" accounted for 54.7% of all the analyzed strains. The MDR strains represented 72.6% and 9.7% among A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In the years 2011 vs. 2018, an increase in infections with MDR bacilli was observed, 34.6% vs. 61.0% (p = 0.0008), respectively, including A. baumannii MDR 16.54% vs. 34.56 % (p = 0.0009) and Enterobacterales ESBL+/AMPC 11.8% vs. 15.44 % (p = 0.3921). Resistance to methicillin was confirmed in 35.2% of S. aureus strains. Resistance to vancomycin was found among 30.9% of Enterococcus spp. The observed period was marked by an increase in the consumption of carbapenems: 197.7 vs. 235.9 defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patients-days. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be dominant pathogens in healthcare-associated infections. The most frequently cultured pathogens were multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae ESBL(+), and P. aeruginosa. The study showed an increase in the incidence of ""alert pathogens"" and MDR bacilli, as well as the tendency of a growing resistance to antibiotics during the observed period. Microbiological analysis of HAIs and the consumption of antibiotics is the necessary element of the proper antibiotic policy in hospitals."

We aim to investigate the epidemiology and the risk factors for CRKP colonization and infections, and to evaluate the application performance of MALDI-TOF MS in clustering CRKP. Results: CRKP colonization and infections incidence was 2.7 (35/1,319,427) per 100,000 patient-days. Inpatients in CRKP group had higher medical expense than CSKP group. Inpatients with underlying conditions, particularly with pulmonary diseases, and with antimicrobial use prior to culture within 30 days, especially with carbapenem use, were risk factors for CRKP acquisition. All CRKP isolates were detected producing KPC-2. The MALDI-TOF MS system and PFGE system provided similar results, with a good concordance between the two methods (adjusted Rand's coefficient, 0.846) and a high probability of MALDI-TOF MS to predict PFGE results (Wallace coefficient, 0.908). Conclusions: Underlying conditions, particularly pulmonary diseases, and antimicrobial use prior to culture within 30 days, especially carbapenem use, are risk factors for CRKP acquisition. Bla KPC-2 is the mainstream gene of CRKP in our geographic area of analysis. As only simple sample preparation is needed and the results can be obtained in a short time, MALDI-TOF MS may be considered a probable alternative to PFGE in clustering KPC-2-producing CRKP."

Materials and Methods: A single-centre, retrospective case-control study representing 734 patients with hematologic malignancies between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, was conducted. Demographic and clinical data were collected from the hospital electronic medical records system. Results: Among the 734 patients with hematologic malignancies, 3% (22/734) of the patients developed CRKP BSI during their hospitalization. Overall 28-day all-cause mortality reached 77.3% (17/22). Patients with Pitt bacteremia score (PBS) >4, pneumonia and septic shock were more frequent in the non-survivors versus the survivors. Compared with the non-survivors in antimicrobial treatment, combination therapy of tigecycline and polymyxin B was more common in the survivors. The independent risk factors associated with CRKP BSI were CRKP rectal colonization (OR, 11.067; CI=4.43-27.644; P<0.001; 3 points), severe neutropenia (OR, 4.095; CI=0.876-19.141; P=0.073; 1 point) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within the previous 30 days to onset of BSI (OR, 18.444; CI=1.787-190.343; P=0.014; 4 points). The total risk score of >=5 indicated that the probability of CRKP BSI occurrence was above 48%. Conclusion: CRKP BSI in patients with hematologic malignancies is associated with high mortality. The risk factor-based prediction model might help clinicians to start prompt effective anti-infective therapy in patients with suspicion of CRKP BSI and improve outcomes."

METHODS: We conducted a search on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Collaborative database for both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing polymyxin monotherapy versus polymyxin-based combination therapy in patients with CR-KP infection. The primary outcome was mortality. We divided all included studies into several groups according to different combination-combination and different infection types. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for outcome analysis. RESULTS: Ten studies with 481 patients were included. Polymyxin monotherapy was associated with a high mortality than polymyxin-based combination therapy in the treatment of CR-KP bloodstream infections (BSI) (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.14-3.27, P = 0.01) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.15-12.71, P = 0.03). In subgroup analysis of different combination, mortality was significantly higher with polymyxin monotherapy compared with combination therapy with tigecycline (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.05-3.37, P = 0.03), or with cabapenem (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.25-7.74, P = 0.01), but no differences were found in combination with aminoglycosides (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.72-2.29, P = 0.38). Three-drug combination therapy based polymyxin also associated a significant survival benefit (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 1.60-9.32, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Polymyxin-based combination therapy provides significant survival benefit in treatment of CR-KP that appears to be more pronounced when a carbapenem or tigecycline is included in the regimen."

METHODS: For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. CONCLUSION: The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed."

Patients The study participants consisted of 7 crewmembers of the passenger cruise-liner, Diamond Princess, who were admitted to our hospital after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 aboard the ship. Methods The data on patient background and biochemical test results were obtained from the patients' medical records. All patients had a chest X-ray, and a throat swab and sputum samples were sent for culture on admission. Results The median age of the 7 patients, of whom 4 were male and 3 were female, was 39 years (range: 23-47 years). On admission, none of them had fever, but 4 (57%) had a cough. None of them showed any signs of organ damage on laboratory testing. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in one individual, which resolved spontaneously, while the other 6 had normal chest X-ray findings. Culture of throat swabs and sputum samples revealed that 4 patients (57%) had bacterial upper respiratory infections (Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus). The period from a positive PCR test to negative conversion ranged from 5 to 13 days, with a median of 8 days. Conclusion Healthy young adults without risk factors who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an asymptomatic infection or may experience mild COVID-19. In addition to obesity, an older age, underlying illness, and being overweight can lead to a risk of exacerbation; thus, hospital management for such individuals may be desirable. Culturing respiratory samples may be useful for diagnosing secondary bacterial pneumonia."

We aimed to investigate pulmonary manifestations by computed tomography (CT). In total, 100 patients with 117 episodes of pulmonary infection were included. Chest CT scans of every episode were analyzed. Random nodules were the most common findings (79.49%), followed by ground-grass opacities (74.36%), focal consolidations (62.39%), and masses (59.83%). Cavities (12.82%) and multiple small abscesses (17.09%) could be found in the consolidations and masses. CT revealed interstitial pneumonia with tree-in-bud opacities (17.09%), interlobular septal thickening (23.08%) and emphysema (35.04%), which were more severe in the bilateral upper lobes. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (78.63%) and axillary lymphadenopathy (65.81%) were common. Fungal infection (n = 27) was the most common and presented with multiple nodules and masses. Approximately 1/4 of fungal infections had interstitial pneumonia. In Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) infections, large areas of consolidation were common. In tuberculosis infection, the pulmonary infections were more severe and complex. For Bacillus Calmette-Guerin disease, left-sided axillary lymphadenopathy was a characteristic manifestation. CT images of CGD demonstrated variable pulmonary abnormalities. The main infectious organisms have unique imaging features."

We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia)-associated SPE in the emergency department. METHODS: Records of patients with primarily extrapulmonary infection of K. pneumoniae who were admitted to the emergency department between 2014 and 2019 were retrieved. The identifications of K. pneumoniaeassociated SPE were mainly dependent on the clinical manifestations, typical imaging findings, and presence of a primary source of K. pneumoniae infection. RESULTS: A total of 33 cases were identified as SPE with extrapulmonary K. pneumoniae infection. The main clinical manifestations were a febrile/fragile state (100%), respiratory symptoms (18.2%), and digestive symptoms (33.3%). Eight patients (24.2%) developed septic shock, 2 (6.0%) experienced respiratory failure, and 2 (6.0%) complicated endophthalmitis. The major source of infection was liver abscess (n=26, 78.8%), followed by septicemia (n=8, 24.2%), intestinal infection (n=3, 9.1%), and ascites (n=1, 3.0%). The computed tomography (CT) features included the following: peripheral wedge-shaped opacity (n=12, 36.4%), a feeding vessel sign (n=3, 9.1%), multiple nodular lesions (n=5, 15.2%), multifocal lung ill-infiltrations (n=15, 45.5%), patchy ground-glass opacities (n=6, 18.2%), focal consolidations (n=9, 27.3%), lung abscesses (n=4, 12.1%), and pleural effusion (n=21, 63.6%). Re-examination of lung HRCT conducted in 7 patients demonstrated imaging improvement after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumonia-SPE presented special clinical and imaging characteristics, which bear similarities to the signs of pneumonia, but was potentially catastrophic.

From 2010 and 2015, adult cases of monomicrobial bloodstream infections caused by cefepime-susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] <= 8 mg/L) K. pneumoniae isolates with carbapenem resistance were reviewed. Those treated by cefepime were compared with those treated by other active agents (OAA) using a propensity score-matched analysis to assess therapeutic effectiveness. The primary endpoint was 30-day crude mortality. A total of 114 patients experienced cefepime-susceptible CRKP bacteremia and 40 (35.1%) died during hospitalization. Thirty-three (29.0%) patients received cefepime therapy. Fifteen (13.3%) patients acquired bloodstream infections due to carbapenemase-producing isolates, and 86.7% of carbapenemase-producing isolates were classified as the cefepime susceptible-dose-dependent (SDD) category. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 30-day mortality was independently associated with the presence of a critical illness (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 12.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.88-42.83; P < .001), pneumonia (aOR, 5.97; 95% CI, 1.65-21.76; P = .007), and rapidly fatal underlying disease (aOR, 6.43; 95% CI, 1.30-31.09; P = .002). In contrast, cefepime-based therapy (aOR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.003-0.38; P = .006) and combination therapy (aOR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.36; P = .001) were protective against a fatal outcome. Based on current breakpoints for Enterobacterales, cefepime therapy was not associated with an unfavorable outcome for CRKP BSIs with MIC-based dosing strategies. However, the susceptibility result of SDD to cefepime should alert clinicians for possible therapeutic failure."

The purpose of this case series is to state that CMV may lead to severe pneumonia along with other bacteria. METHODOLOGY: CMV pneumonia was diagnosed with the thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan findings, bronchoscopic biopsy, real time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and clinical symptoms. For extraction of CMV DNA from the clinical sample, EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (Qiagen, Germany) was used, and aplification was performed with CMV QS-RGQ Kit (Qiagen, Germany) on Rotor Gene Q 5 Plex HMR (Qiagen, Germany) device. RESULTS: All recipients had severe pneumonia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and at least two-fold increase in transaminases on seventh, twenty-eighth and twenty-second days after surgery, respectively. Thoracic CT scan revealed as diffuse interstitial infiltration in the lung parenchyma. Bronchoscopy, Gram-staining and culture from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed in all of them. During bronchoscopy, a bronchial biopsy was administered to two recipients. One recipient could not be performed procedure because of deep thrombocytopenia. PCR results were positive from serum and BAL fluid. Bronchial biopsy was compatible with CMV pneumonia. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosae was found in two cases and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one case BAL fluid cultures. CONCLUSIONS: CMV pneumonia can be seen simultaneously with bacterial agents due to the indirect effects of the CMV.

Results: A total of 1 590 cases were collected, including 831 cases from BSI, 450 cases from HAP and 309 cases from IAI. The most prevalent pathogens causing BSI were Escherichia coli (29.2%, 243/831), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%, 135/831) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%, 84/831); the most prevalent pathogens causing IAI were E. coli (26.2%, 81/309), Enterococcus faecium (15.5%, 48/309) and K. pneumoniae (13.3%, 41/309); while Acinetobacter baumanii (24.7%, 111/450), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%, 93/450) and K. pneumoniae (16.2%, 73/450) were dominated in HAP. All S. aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides; 77.8% (105/135) of S. aureus strains were susceptible to ceftaroline. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.6% (40/135) of all the S. aureus, and was lower than the accounted rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) (83.7%, 41/49). One E. faecium strain (1.1%, 1/95) resistant to vacomycin and teicoplanin and one E. faecalis strain (2.3%, 1/43) resistant to linezolid was found. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 56.1% (193/344) in E. coli and 22.1% (55/249) in K. pneumonia; the rate of carbapenem resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 4.1% (14/344) and 22.9% (57/249), respectively; the percentage of ceftazidime/avibactam resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 2.3% (8/344) and 2.0% (5/249), respectively; the percentage of colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 1.5% (5/344) and 7.6% (19/249), respectively; no E. coli and K. pneumonia strains were found resistant to tigecycline. The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa were 78.9% (146/185) and 36.7% (66/180), respectively. A. baumanii showed low susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents except colistin (99.5%, 184/185) and tigecycline (91.4%, 169/185).

Information on the prevalence of bacterial co-infection in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: In a cross-sectional study, blood culture (BC) and endotracheal aspirate (ETA) were obtained from COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2). The bacterial isolates were confirmed by the standard microbiological methods. Antibiotic resistance was determined using the disk diffusion method. Results: Among these 340 patients with COVID-19, a total of 43 (12.46%) patients had secondary bacterial infections. The most common bacteria isolated through ETA and BC included Klebsiella species 11 (25.59%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 9 (20.93%), Escherichia coli 7 (16.28%), methicillin-resistant Staph ylo coccus aureus (MRSA) 6 (13.95%), Enterobacter species 5 (11.63%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 (2.32%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (9.30%).

The management of infectious pseudoaneurysm remains controversial. CASE SUMMARY: We reported a 79-year-old man with previous Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary infection and multiple comorbidities who presented with a progressive pulsate mass at the right groin and with right lower limb pain. Computed tomography angiography showed a 6 cm x 6 cm x 9 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery accompanied by occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery. He underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) with stent-graft, and etiology of infectious pseudoaneurysm was confirmed. Then, 3-mo antibiotic therapy was given.

The 36-year-old mother was admitted at 18 weeks + 1 day of gestation for threatened abortion. IUFD occurred 11 days after. Fetal postmortem showed severe AC and funisitis, neutrophils within alveoli and intestinal lumen, associated with rod-like bacteria. Fetal blood and lung cultures grew K. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-non-producing strain. Antibiogram revealed sensitivity for piperacillin/tazobactam. Three days after IUFD, the mother presented with fever (37.8  C) which persisted for one week. Maternal blood and urine cultures were negative. According to fetal microbiological results, available 6 days after IUFD, initial treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced with piperacillin/tazobactam with full patient recovery. Therefore, in the event of PPROM and IUFD, fetal microbiological investigations should always be performed to isolate the proper etiologic agent and start the correct medical treatment."

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

AIM: To determine and analyze the incidence, risk factors and etiologic agents of NI in newborns admitted in the NICU to help plan-ning future surveillance and prevention strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out at the NICU of St George University Hospital, Plovdiv, Bul-garia from January 1, 2017 to June 31, 2018. The number of neonates included in the study was 507. Descriptive statistics such as count,  percent, mean and standard deviation was used. Chi-square test was performed to prove associations. Odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were computed from the results of the binominal logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 507 hospitalized newborns in NICU, 48 presented with 54 NI. The incidence and the density incidence rates were 9.5% and 7.67 per 1,000 patient-days, respectively. Nosocomial infections were detected in neonates from all birth weight (BW) classes, but it was low BW and premature neonates that were at major risk to acquire them. The most common infection sites were ventilator-asso-ciated pneumonia (VAP) (67.27%), bloodstream infection (23.64%) and conjunctivitis (9.09%). Major pathogens were Gram-negative such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis NIs were strongly associated with intubation, presence of a venous catheter, the duration of antibiotic treatment and increased CRP> 10 mg/l. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the burden of NIs, identifies the major focus for future NI control and prevention programs."

Between 1992-1993, 99 acute and convalescent sera were collected from patients with CAP of unknown etiology. The sera were tested using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) against the following antigens: Legionella pneumophila, serogroups 3,5,6 and 7 and L. longbeachae, L. anisa, L. bozemanii and Legionella-Like Amoebal Pathogens (LLAP). A four-fold rise in titer to at least one of the antigens tested, was seen in 14% of patients; 8% to L. bozemanii, 4% to L. anisa, 2% to S. lyticum, 2% to LLAP 10 and 1% each to LLAP 1, 6 and 9. Two patients reacted to several antigens. These results indicate that other species of legionella may be important in the etiology of CAP. L. bozemanii was the organism identified in the majority of these infections. Better diagnostic studies i.e. cultures, serologies and urinary antigen testing, which recognize legionella isolates other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1 need to be developed."

A further two patients were observed to have high titres consistent with previous exposure but earlier serum samples were not available for comparison. No patients had antibody responses to Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1 and 2. L. longbeachae was not cultured from respiratory secretions from patients or from the environment within the unit. Legionella anisa was recovered from one cooling tower on the ninth floor of the tower block. The ICU is located on the first floor of the same tower and receives external air from two vents, one on the eastern and the other on the western aspect. All patients with serological evidence of L. longbeachae infection were concomitantly infected with multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and were located in bays on the eastern side of the unit. A large pigeon nest was discovered within 1-2 m of the eastern vent. Following removal of the birds' nest, no further cases were seen on routine screening of all patients within the unit over the next eight weeks. Alternatively, seroconversion may have been related to demolition of the adjacent nine-storey nurses home. This was begun one month before the first case was diagnosed and was completed four months later. The periodic northerly winds could have carried legionellae from the demolition site directly over the block housing the ICU and may have concentrated them near the eastern air vent. All patients had pneumonia, which was probably multifactorial in origin. There is some uncertainty whether the serological responses seen were an epiphenomenon or were truly indicative of infection with L. longbeachae."

Twelve of 30 serum samples seroconverted to one amoeba-associated bacterium isolated in the ICU, mainly Legionella anisa and Bosea massiliensis, the most common isolates from water (p=0.021). Amoeba-associated bacteria DNA was detected in BAL samples from two patients whose samples later seroconverted. Seroconversion was significantly associated with VAP and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, especially in patients for whom no etiologic agent was found by usual microbiologic investigations. Amoeba-associated bacteria might be a cause of VAP in ICUs, especially when microbiologic investigations are negative."

The aim was to determine the utility of front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR in a severe respiratory infection algorithm. METHODS: L. pneumophila and Legionella species duplex real-time PCR was carried out on 1944 specimens from hospitalised patients over a 4 year period in Edinburgh, UK. RESULTS: L. pneumophila was detected by PCR in 49 (2.7%) specimens from 36 patients. During a LD outbreak, combined L. pneumophila respiratory PCR and urinary antigen testing had optimal sensitivity and specificity (92.6% and 98.3% respectively) for the detection of confirmed cases. Legionella species was detected by PCR in 16 (0.9%) specimens from 10 patients. The 5 confirmed and 1 probable cases of Legionella longbeachae LD were both PCR and antibody positive. CONCLUSIONS: Front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR is a valuable addition to urinary antigen testing as part of a well-defined algorithm.

These bacteria are transmitted by inhalation of aerosols or aspiration of contaminated water. In Spain, environmental studies have demonstrated the presence of Legionella non-pneumophila species in drinking water treatment plants and water distribution networks. Aware that this evidence indicates a risk factor and the lack of routine assays designed to detect simultaneously diverse Legionella species, we analyzed 210 urine samples from patients presenting clinical manifestations of pneumonia using a semi-nested PCR for partial amplification of the 16S rDNA gene of Legionella and a diagnostic method used in hospitals for Legionella antigen detection. In this study, we detected a total of 15 cases of legionellosis (7.1%) and the first case of Legionnaires' disease caused by L. anisa in Spain. While the conventional method used in hospitals could only detect four cases (1.9%) produced by L. pneumophila serogroup 1, using PCR, the following species were identified: Legionella spp. (10/15), L. pneumophila (4/15) and L. anisa (1/15). These results suggest the need to change hospital diagnostic strategies regarding the identification of Legionella species associated with this disease. Therefore, the detection of Legionella DNA by PCR in urine samples seems to be a suitable alternative method for a sensitive, accurate and rapid diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia, caused by L. pneumophila and also for L. non-pneumophila species."

The patient from whom L. dumoffii was isolated was a 59-year-old male with no basic disease. He presented chill, fever, coughing and other symptoms, starting on July 3, 1986, his disease was diagnosed as pneumonia at the clinic of his company. The patient was then introduced and admitted to our hospital. On admission chest radiography disclosed zonal pneumonia with an unclear border in the right superior lobe of the lung; a beta-lactam preparation was administered, but no effect was obtained and the lung lesion showed a rapid advance. From this condition, we suspected legionella pneumonia and changed the therapy to treatment with erythromycin and rifampicillin. Despite this, no improvement occurred and the patient died on the 26th hospital day. Colonies like Legionella colonies were separated from a total of seven specimens of biopsy aspirated matter from the airway and autopsy collected lung abscess and tracheal secretions, and the bacterium was identified L. dumoffii based on the biochemical and serological properties. In addition, the patient's serum was found to have an increased antibody titer against L. dumoffii. Based on these findings, the patient's disease was diagnosed as pneumonia as caused by L. dumoffii, a relatively rare bacterium as a member of the genus Legionella. The patient from whom Legionella pneumophila serogroup 5 was isolated was an 81-year-old man with basic diseases such as heart failure, anemia and hypothyroidism. He presented fever, general fatigue, anorexia and other symptoms, starting around June 2, 1987; pneumonia was suspected and the patient was urgently admitted to our hospital. The patient died of pneumonia of unknown cause on the second hospital day. To clarify the cause, autopsy was conducted; a large number of colonies like Legionella colonies were noted in the lung tissue. Identification test was then conducted and the bacterium was identified as L. pneumophila; we concluded that the patient's pneumonia had been caused by the identified bacterium L. pneumophila. The isolate was further subjected to slide agglutination test and identified as L. pneumophila serogroup 5."

Multicentric prospective study of 274 hospitalized patients.ABSTRACT:In 1982 and 1983 a prospective study was carried out involving 274 adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired acute pneumonia. The results of the bacteriological and serological diagnoses are presented here. Conventional and standardized bacteriological methods were used. All the serodiagnoses of LD were carried out with the 13 antigens produced by the ""Centre National de Reference"" (L. pneumophila 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; L. micdadei; L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. jordanis; L. gormanii; L. longbeachae 1 and 2). Standardized criteria were used for the interpretation of results. Conventional methods were used for the other serodiagnoses. Because the laboratory results had been interpreted very rigorously, an etiological diagnosis was established only in 51% of pneumonia cases. Other reasons, such as the frequent prescription of antibiotics prior to hospitalization, may explain why no aetiology could be determined in 49% of cases. The microbial agents responsible were: S. pneumoniae, Legionella and M. pneumoniae in 62% of cases; H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, Chlamydia and S. aureus in 21.6%; and viruses in 8.6%. 29 (10%) of the 274 pneumonia cases were caused by Legionella, being second to S. pneumoniae. The preponderance of L. pneumophila was striking (22 cases), 3 Legionella strains were isolated (L. pneumophila serogroup 1:2 strains, serogroup 6:1 strain). Three associated or successive infections were observed (influenza, Leptospirosis, Coxiella infection). As regards the other bacteria, implication of the strain isolated was based on its multiple occurrence in several samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In two prospective studies, one involving 110 intensive-care unit (ICU) patients with mainly nosocomial pneumonias and the other 105 patients with community-acquired pneumonias, we investigated the incidence and significance of Legionella pneumophila and non-pneumophila pneumonias on the basis of 17 different main serogroups. In the first study, 14 ICU patients had 15 (13.6%) Legionella pneumonias, which, in 5 cases (33%), were of non-pneumophila etiology. In the second study, 9 patients with community-acquired pneumonias had 10 (9.5%) Legionella pneumonias. Leading this study were 6 L. gormanii infections, followed by 2 L. dumoffii and only 1 L. pneumophila and 1 L. longbeachae pneumonia. Of the total, 22 of 23 patients with Legionnaires' disease suffered from severe basic diseases and complications (acute renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, etc.) predominant among the nosocomial pneumonias. The mortality rate was significant in these patients at 33% (5 patients) in the ICU group and 10% (1 patient) in the group with community-acquired pneumonias. We conclude that non-pneumophila Legionella species should receive more diagnostic and therapeutic consideration in patients with nosocomial or community-acquired pneumonias."

The diagnosis of LD was based on positive serology. Antibodies to 10 different legionella antigens--Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-6, Fluoribacter (Legionella) bozemanae, F. dumoffii, F. gormanii, and Tatlockia (Legionella) micdadei--were measured by the microagglutination (MA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques. LD was diagnosed in 22 patients showing a 4-fold or greater rise of MA titers. 10 patients showed a 4-fold or greater rise of IFA titer, 2 had standing high titer. One patient died. Legionella infection was the second most common cause of pneumonia. However, in half of the cases legionella infection occurred concomitantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, or viral infections. All 22 LD cases were sporadic. LD had been contracted abroad by 6 patients. Two of the legionella pneumonias were hospital-acquired. Half of the LD patients were older than 60 years.

On the basis of knowledge available at present, the Legionellaceae family accounts for these bacteria. There are five different species in the genus Legionella: L. pneumophila, L. micdadei, L. bozemannii, L. dumoffii and L. gormanii. L. pneumophila occurs most frequently and has six serogroups (Serogroups 1-6), the first of which is the most important. Legionelloses, the diseases caused by these organisms, occur epidemically, endemically or sporadically. In clinical terms, these are acute cases of pneumonia which occur especially frequently in older persons and immunocompromised hosts. The course is severe in such patients. There is increased lethality. Erythromycin, rifampicin and cefoxitin are the most effective antibiotics. After the culture has been made in the suitable milieu and the material obtained by pulmonary aspiration has been inoculated into guinea pigs, the bacteriological diagnosis is made by direct immunofluorescence. The serological diagnosis is based on evidence of serological changes demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence test."

Slide agglutination testing eventually identified both isolates as L. cincinnatiensis. Infection with Legionella species, including L. cincinnatiensis, should be considered not only in the first months after transplantation but also later in the posttransplantation period as either a nosocomial or community-acquired infection."

The 33 strains involved 12 Legionella species or subspecies: 15 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, 3 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri or L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei, 4 strains of ""L. donaldsonii,"" 3 strains of L. micdadei, and one each of L. bozemanae, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. parisiensis, L. sainthelensi, and Legionella sp. strain D5382. All patients except one asymptomatic carrier showed pneumonia, including one with concurrent bacteremia. Nine patients died, with this infection being the immediate cause of death in six. Twenty-seven patients had underlying hematologic malignancies. Twenty-three patients were leukopenic. Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp. D5382 are likely the first reports of human infection with these organisms. "

Multicentric prospective study of 274 hospitalized patients.ABSTRACT:In 1982 and 1983 a prospective study was carried out involving 274 adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired acute pneumonia. The results of the bacteriological and serological diagnoses are presented here. Conventional and standardized bacteriological methods were used. All the serodiagnoses of LD were carried out with the 13 antigens produced by the ""Centre National de Reference"" (L. pneumophila 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; L. micdadei; L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. jordanis; L. gormanii; L. longbeachae 1 and 2). Standardized criteria were used for the interpretation of results. Conventional methods were used for the other serodiagnoses. Because the laboratory results had been interpreted very rigorously, an etiological diagnosis was established only in 51% of pneumonia cases. Other reasons, such as the frequent prescription of antibiotics prior to hospitalization, may explain why no aetiology could be determined in 49% of cases. The microbial agents responsible were: S. pneumoniae, Legionella and M. pneumoniae in 62% of cases; H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, Chlamydia and S. aureus in 21.6%; and viruses in 8.6%. 29 (10%) of the 274 pneumonia cases were caused by Legionella, being second to S. pneumoniae. The preponderance of L. pneumophila was striking (22 cases), 3 Legionella strains were isolated (L. pneumophila serogroup 1:2 strains, serogroup 6:1 strain). Three associated or successive infections were observed (influenza, Leptospirosis, Coxiella infection). As regards the other bacteria, implication of the strain isolated was based on its multiple occurrence in several samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In two prospective studies, one involving 110 intensive-care unit (ICU) patients with mainly nosocomial pneumonias and the other 105 patients with community-acquired pneumonias, we investigated the incidence and significance of Legionella pneumophila and non-pneumophila pneumonias on the basis of 17 different main serogroups. In the first study, 14 ICU patients had 15 (13.6%) Legionella pneumonias, which, in 5 cases (33%), were of non-pneumophila etiology. In the second study, 9 patients with community-acquired pneumonias had 10 (9.5%) Legionella pneumonias. Leading this study were 6 L. gormanii infections, followed by 2 L. dumoffii and only 1 L. pneumophila and 1 L. longbeachae pneumonia. Of the total, 22 of 23 patients with Legionnaires' disease suffered from severe basic diseases and complications (acute renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, etc.) predominant among the nosocomial pneumonias. The mortality rate was significant in these patients at 33% (5 patients) in the ICU group and 10% (1 patient) in the group with community-acquired pneumonias. We conclude that non-pneumophila Legionella species should receive more diagnostic and therapeutic consideration in patients with nosocomial or community-acquired pneumonias."

The diagnosis of LD was based on positive serology. Antibodies to 10 different legionella antigens--Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-6, Fluoribacter (Legionella) bozemanae, F. dumoffii, F. gormanii, and Tatlockia (Legionella) micdadei--were measured by the microagglutination (MA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques. LD was diagnosed in 22 patients showing a 4-fold or greater rise of MA titers. 10 patients showed a 4-fold or greater rise of IFA titer, 2 had standing high titer. One patient died. Legionella infection was the second most common cause of pneumonia. However, in half of the cases legionella infection occurred concomitantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, or viral infections. All 22 LD cases were sporadic. LD had been contracted abroad by 6 patients. Two of the legionella pneumonias were hospital-acquired. Half of the LD patients were older than 60 years. The majority of cases occurred during the winter months. Neither clinical chemistry parameters nor clinical features could distinguish LD from other types of pneumonia."

On the basis of knowledge available at present, the Legionellaceae family accounts for these bacteria. There are five different species in the genus Legionella: L. pneumophila, L. micdadei, L. bozemannii, L. dumoffii and L. gormanii. L. pneumophila occurs most frequently and has six serogroups (Serogroups 1-6), the first of which is the most important. Legionelloses, the diseases caused by these organisms, occur epidemically, endemically or sporadically. In clinical terms, these are acute cases of pneumonia which occur especially frequently in older persons and immunocompromised hosts. The course is severe in such patients. There is increased lethality. Erythromycin, rifampicin and cefoxitin are the most effective antibiotics. After the culture has been made in the suitable milieu and the material obtained by pulmonary aspiration has been inoculated into guinea pigs, the bacteriological diagnosis is made by direct immunofluorescence. The serological diagnosis is based on evidence of serological changes demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence test."

We aimed to evaluate clinical features and outcomes of patients with Legionnaires' disease at a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan. METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2013, a retrospective study of adult cases of Legionnaires' disease was conducted in a 1200-bed tertiary hospital. Their medical records were reviewed for further evaluation and analysis. RESULTS: A total of 61 cases of Legionnaires' disease were identified during the study period. Their mean age was 61.1 years, with male predominance (43, 70.5%). Among them, 30 (49.2%) had healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), 20 (32.8%) had community-acquired pneumonia, and notably 11 (18.0%) were caregivers. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia tend to have higher Charlson comorbidity scores than those with community-acquired pneumonia (3.6+-2.4 vs. 1.9+-1.9, p=0.008) and caregivers (0.5+-0.5, p&lt;0.001). Six patients died, resulting in an in-hospital mortality rate of 9.8%. Underlying cancer (66.7% vs. 20.0%, p=0.028) and a higher Charlson comorbidity score (4.7+-2.6 vs. 2.2+-2.2, p=0.013) were related to a fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: L. pneumophila remains an important pathogen for pneumonia acquired from the community or associated with healthcare facility.

SUMMARY: A 57-year-old man with longstanding CD was hospitalized with a four-day history of fever (38.5  C), dyspnea, left pleuritic pain, and weight loss (more than 6 kg) about six weeks after beginning treatment with ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody approved in the United States for two indications (plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis) and currently under investigation as a potential treatment for CD and other inflammatory disorders. During the preceding 25 years, the man had been treated for severe CD with a number of agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab); ultimately, off-label ustekinumab therapy (90 mg subcutaneously weekly) was initiated due to persistent severe CD symptoms. Chest x-ray studies at the time of admission demonstrated left upper lobar consolidation, and a urine antigen test was positive for L. pneumophila. The patient was treated with i.v. levofloxacin and methylprednisolone and discharged after two weeks. Ustekinumab was reintroduced (45 mg subcutaneously every two weeks), and the patient continued to receive the drug for 16 months, with clinical remission of CD symptoms and no further adverse events. A literature search identified two case reports of pneumonia associated with ustekinumab use, but neither case involved L. pneumophila. CONCLUSION: Pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila developed in a patient with CD treated with ustekinumab. Pneumonia symptoms resolved after ustekinumab was discontinued."

DESIGN AND SETTING:: Observational study of patients with refractory respiratory failure treated with ECMO in Hospital S.Joao (Porto, Portugal), between November 2009 and September 2016. PARTICIPANTS:: A total of 112 patients rescued with ECMO, of which 14 had Legionella pneumonia. RESULTS:: Patients with Legionella pneumonia were slightly older than patients with acute respiratory failure of other etiologies (51 [48-56] vs 45 [35-54]), but with no significant differences in acute respiratory failure severity between groups: Pao2/Fio2 ratio 67 (60-75) versus 69 (55-85) and Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction score 4 (1-5) versus 2 (-1-4), respectively. Legionella pneumonia was associated with earlier ECMO initiation (days of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV] before ECMO: 2.0 [1.0-4.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-9.5]). After IMV adjustment to ""lung rest"" settings, this group presented higher respiratory system (RS) static compliance (28.7 [18.8-37.4] vs 16.0 [10.0-20.8] mL/cmH2O) but required higher ECMO support (blood flow 5.0 [4.3-5.4] vs 4.2 [3.6-4.8]). Patients with Legionella pneumonia had shorter IMV (16 [14-23] vs 27 [20-42] days) and lower incidence of intensive care unit nosocomial infections (35.7% vs 64.3%), with a trend to higher hospital survival (85.7% vs 62.2%; P = .13). CONCLUSION:: In Legionella pneumonia complicated by refractory respiratory failure, ECMO support allowed patient stabilization under lung protective ventilation and high survival rates.

The prevalence of atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis among patients with these illnesses in the ambulatory setting has not been previously summarized. We set out to derive prevalence information from the existing literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE for prospective, consecutive-series studies reporting the prevalence of M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, L pneumophila and/or B pertussis in outpatients with cough, acute bronchitis, LRTI, or CAP. Articles were independently reviewed by 2 authors for inclusion and abstraction of data; discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion. A meta-analysis was performed on each pathogen to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates using a random effects model of raw proportions. RESULTS: Fifty studies met our inclusion criteria. While calculated heterogeneity was high, most studies reported prevalence for each pathogen within a fairly narrow range. In patients with CAP, the overall prevalences of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were 10.1% (95% CI, 7.1%-13.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%), respectively. Consistent with previous reports, M pneumoniae prevalence peaked in roughly 6-year intervals. Overall prevalence of L pneumophila was 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%), but the organism was rare in children, with only 1 case in 1,765. In patients with prolonged cough in primary care, the prevalence of B pertussis was 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-19.8%), although it was higher in studies that included only children (17.6%; 95% CI, 3.4%-31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical bacterial pathogens are relatively common causes of lower respiratory diseases, including cough, bronchitis, and CAP. Where surveillance data were available, we found higher prevalences in studies where all patients are tested for these pathogens. It is likely that these conditions are underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in current clinical practice."

AIM: To assess the etiology of CAP in immunocompetent adult hospitalized patients using conventional and molecular diagnostic methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 240 adult patients who were hospitalized for CAP to identify the microbial etiology. Sputum and blood cultures were obtained as well as serology testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of sixteen respiratory viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In 100 patients (41.7%) a single respiratory pathogen was identified. In 17 (7.1%) cases, a mixed bacterial and viral infection was detected and no pathogen was identified in 123 cases (51%). The most commonly identified pathogens identified were: influenza virus (15.4%), parainfluenza virus (10.8%), rhinovirus (5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5%), respiratory syncytial virus (2.9%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2.5%). Infectious agent detection by RT-PCR provided greater sensitivity than conventional techniques. Viral respiratory infections were more prevalent in older patients with comorbidities and high risk patients, according to the Fine index at hospital admission. The clinical severity and outcome were independent of the etiological agents detected. CONCLUSIONS: The use of molecular diagnostic techniques expanded the detection of respiratory viruses in immunocompetent adults hospitalized with CAP."

This post-hoc analysis evaluated the effect of addition of a macrolide to ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone treatment in atypical CAP. METHODS: Two phase 3, double-blind, comparative safety and efficacy studies of ceftaroline fosamil vs. ceftriaxone, FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2, enrolled adults with CAP. Only FOCUS 1 included 24-h adjunctive clarithromycin therapy for all patients on day 1. Day 4 and test-of-cure (TOC) outcomes were compared for adjunctive vs. no adjunctive therapy. RESULTS: Of 1240 enrolled patients, 130 patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens alone were included (FOCUS 1, n = 64; FOCUS 2, n = 66). Among patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or Chlamydophila pneumoniae alone, a higher clinical response rate was observed with clarithromycin plus ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone compared with treatment without additional clarithromycin at day 4 [38/49 (77.6%; FOCUS 1) vs. 24/43 (55.8%; FOCUS 2)], but not at the TOC assessment [42/49 (85.7%; FOCUS 1) vs. 41/43 (95.3%; FOCUS 2)]. In patients infected with Legionella pneumophila alone, a higher clinical response rate with adjunctive clarithromycin therapy was observed at the TOC assessment alone [12/12 (100%; FOCUS 1) vs. 14/19 (73.7%; FOCUS 2)]. The unadjusted odds ratio of a favourable clinical response at day 4 with adjunctive clarithromycin vs. no adjunctive clarithromycin was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.1; P = 0.0299) for all pathogens combined. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that empirical antibiotic therapy against atypical pathogens may improve early clinical response rate. This hypothesis is best evaluated in a prospective trial."

Limited data exist about the impact of PCV on the aetiology of CAP as a whole. The aim of the present study is to describe the overall changes in microbial aetiology, pneumococcal burden (including non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia) and its serotypes in adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) after the introduction of these PCVs. METHODS: Hospitalised adult CAP patients who participated in three consecutive trials were studied (2004-2006 (n=201), 2007-2009 (n=304) and 2012-2016 (n=300) and considered as pre-PCV7, PCV7 and PCV10 period). Extensive conventional microbiological testing was applied for all patients. In addition, patients with a serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody response were diagnosed with pneumococcal CAP. Changes in proportions of causative pathogens and distributions of pneumococcal serotypes were calculated. RESULTS: The proportion of pneumococcal CAP decreased from 37% (n=74/201) to 26% (n=77/300) comparing the pre-PCV7 period with the PCV10 period (p=0.01). For other pathogens, including Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, and respiratory viruses, no sustained shifts were observed in their relative contribution to the aetiology of CAP. Within the pneumococcal CAP patients, we observed a decrease in PCV7 and an increase in non-PCV10 serotype disease. PCV10-extra type disease did not decrease significantly comparing the PCV10 period with the pre-PCV7 and PCV7 period, respectively. Notably, PCV7 type disease decreased both in bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that PCV introduction in infants impact the microbial aetiology of adult CAP and suggest herd effects in adults with CAP after introduction of PCVs in children."

We report a case of severe pneumonia caused by Legionella longbeachae, where a method of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay contributed an important role for the early detection. This case involved an 83-year-old man who developed fever, dyspnea, and productive cough. Since the medication of prescribed ceftriaxone had not been effective, he visited the emergency room of our hospital, where an X-ray revealed a severe pneumonia harboring a consolidation with air bronchogram in his right lower lung. His sputum and urine were subjected to the routine bacterial culture or the urinary antigen test for Legionella, which initially brought negative results. However, a positive result of LAMP assay enabled early diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia. Later, the bacterial cultures of sputum made some progress and 16S rRNA sequencing provided a proof of L. longbeachae. This LAMP assay may bring a benefit for the patients with Legionella pneumonia by enabling early detection of not only specific L. pneumophila serogroup 1, but also of the other Legionella species."

Since serological results suggested that Legionella pneumophila was the infectious agent, she was discharged on levofloxacin. A week later, she was again admitted with fever. CT scan showed opacities with crescentic morphology and a central ground-glass area suggestive of cryptogenic organising pneumonia. Microbiological, serological and autoimmunity tests were negative. She underwent surgical lung biopsy that revealed inflammatory infiltrate, macrophage desquamation, fibroblasts proliferation and fibrin deposition in the alveolar spaces, consistent with AFOP. She started corticotherapy with good response. Disease relapsed after prednisolone discontinuation, 10 months later. Currently, the patient is on prednisolone 5 mg/day without clinical and radiological recurrence."

We analyzed 176 patients with Legionella pneumonia and compared them with 217 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia and 202 patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. We evaluated four scoring systems, the Winthrop-University Hospital score, Community-Based Pneumonia Incidence Study Group score, and Japan Respiratory Society score, but they demonstrated limited sensitivity and specificity for predicting Legionella pneumonia. Using six clinical and laboratory parameters (high fever, high C-reactive protein, high lactate dehydrogenase, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and unproductive cough) reported by Fiumefreddo and colleagues, only 6% had Legionnella pneumonia when less than 2 parameters were present. The efficacy rates of antibiotics at the time of termination were 94.6% for intravenous antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and pazufloxacin, and 95.5% for oral antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, garenoxacin, moxifloxacin, and clarithromycin. Our results suggested that the previously reported clinical scoring systems to predict Legionnella pneumonia are not useful, but 6 simple diagnostic score accurately ruled out Legionnella pneumonia, which may help to optimize initial empiric therapy. Quinolones and clarithromycin still showed good clinical efficacy against Legionella pneumonia."

Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounts for 20-40% of all CAP and L. pneumophila is responsible for 3-15% of cases. The paucity of data from India in this regard prompted us to conduct this prospective multicentric analysis to detect the prevalence of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in our geographical region. A total of 453 patients with symptoms of pneumonia and 90 controls with no history of lower respiratory tract infections were included in the study. A duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 543 bp region of P1 adhesin gene of M. pneumoniae and 375 bp region of macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene of L. pneumophila was standardized for simultaneous detection of these atypical pathogens. Respiratory secretions, blood, and urine samples were collected from each patient and control and were subjected to duplex PCR, culture and serology for M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. Urine samples were subjected for detecting L. pneumophila antigen. Among the 453 patients investigated for M. pneumoniae, 52 (11.4%) were positive for IgM antibodies, 17 were positive by culture, and seven tested positive by PCR (P1 gene). Similarly for L. pneumophila, 50 cases (11%) were serologically positive for IgM antibodies, one was positive by PCR (mip gene) and urine antigen detection. A total of eight samples were positive by duplex PCR for M. pneumoniae P1 gene (N = 7) and L. pneumophila mip gene (N = 1). Of the 90 controls, two samples (2.2%) showed IgM positivity, and 15 (16.7%) showed IgG positivity for M. pneumoniae. For L. pneumophila, three samples (3.3%) tested positive for IgM, and 12 (13.3%) tested positive for IgG antibodies. The study findings indicate the presence of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in our geographical region, and a combination of laboratory approaches including PCR, culture, and serology is required for effective detection of these agents."

After 1950, the proportion of pneumonia caused by pneumococcus began to decline. Pneumococcus has continued to decline; at present, this organism is identified in fewer than fewer10%-15% of cases. This proportion is higher in Europe, a finding likely related to differences in vaccination practices and smoking. Gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella are each identified in 2%-5% of patients with pneumonia who require hospitalization. Viruses are found in 25% of patients, up to one-third of these have bacterial coinfection. Recent studies fail to identify a causative organism in more than 50% of cases, which remains the most important challenge to understanding lower respiratory infection.

Recently, most of the Legionella cases have been diagnosed using the urine antigen test. However, this test can reliably detect only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Here we report a 63-year-old male patient who was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia and treated with chemotherapy and who developed pneumonia on hospital day 8 during the nadir phase.

In addition to common viruses and bacterial pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae), fastidious respiratory pathogens like Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp. can cause severe atypical pneumonia. They do not respond to penicillin derivatives, which may cause failure of antibiotic empirical therapy. The same applies for infections with B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, the cause of pertussis disease, that may present atypically and need to be treated with macrolides. Moreover, these fastidious bacteria are difficult to identify by culture or serology, and therefore often remain undetected. Thus, rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonia is crucial. We performed a retrospective method evaluation study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the new, commercially available Lightmix  multiplex RT-PCR assay that detects these fastidious bacterial pathogens causing atypical pneumonia. In this retrospective study, 368 clinical respiratory specimens, obtained from patients suffering from atypical pneumonia that have been tested negative for the presence of common agents of pneumonia by culture and viral PCR, were investigated. These clinical specimens have been previously characterized by singleplex RT-PCR assays in our diagnostic laboratory and were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the respiratory multiplex Lightmix  RT-PCR. The multiplex RT-PCR displayed a limit of detection between 5 and 10 DNA copies for different in-panel organisms and showed identical performance characteristics with respect to specificity and sensitivity as in-house singleplex RT-PCRs for pathogen detection. The Lightmix  multiplex RT-PCR assay represents a low-cost, time-saving and accurate diagnostic tool with high throughput potential. The time-to-result using an automated DNA extraction device for respiratory specimens followed by multiplex RT-PCR detection was below 4 h, which is expected to significantly improve diagnostics for atypical pneumonia-associated bacterial pathogens."

","SPECIES:Legionella gresiliensisID:29605219TITLE:Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.ABSTRACT:Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (n = 1032) and tuberculosis (n = 1101) admitted to our hospital. RESULTS: Sixty-nine (6.7%) patients with CAP and 23 (2.1%) with pulmonary tuberculosis developed CALP. Legionella species were the most common pathogen (27 patients, 39.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (19 patients, 27.5%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18 patients, 26.1%). Symptom duration was longer in the patients with TLP than in those with CALP. On chest radiographs, cavitation in the area of lobar pneumonia and nodular shadows were radiological findings predictive of TLP. High-resolution computed tomography showed cavitation in the area of lobar pneumonia, well-defined centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud sign to be the radiological findings predictive of TLP by multivariate logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: Common causes of CALP are Legionella species, S. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae. TLP should be considered in patients with lobar pneumonia, particularly in patients with long symptom duration, cavitation, and nodular shadows on chest radiographs, and cavitation, well-defined centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud sign on CT."

This study tries to assess the situation of this infection in this area. METHOD: Retrospective study of all patients with positive Legionella antigenuria treated at the University Hospital Lucus Augusti in Lugo (Spain) from 2001, the year in which this test was introduced in our centre, until 2015. We analysed epidemiological data, risk factors, clinical, radiological and biochemical findings, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: The sampled included 136 patients. When comparing the first five years of the study with the last five, the incidence increased from 10.9 to 64.5 cases/1,000,000; the number of antigenuria requests increased 3.4 times, and compared to other pneumonia aetiologies Legionella increased from 0.9% to 15%. The mean age was 64.1years and 84.6% were males; 74.3% had comorbidities. Males were significantly younger (62.7+-16.6 vs 71.9+-17.3) and consumed more alcohol (26.1% vs 0%) and tobacco (67.8% vs 14.3%). Diagnosis was established within the first 72hours in 88.9% of cases and most received levofloxacin (95.6%). Hospitalisation was needed in 85% of cases, 11.7% in ICU and 4.4% died. CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of antigenuria there was an increase in the incidence of Legionella pneumonia recorded in our health area. Its rate in recent years has been one of the highest in our country. Despite the fact that the patients had advanced age and comorbidities, mortality was low."

These recommendations were based on expert opinions and have not been rigorously evaluated. METHODS: We used data from a multicenter, prospective, surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the IDSA/ATS UAT indications for identifying patients who test positive. SP and LP UATs were completed on all included patients. Separate analyses were completed for SP and LP, using 2-by-2 contingency tables, comparing the IDSA/ATS indications (UAT recommended vs not recommended) and UAT results (positive vs negative). Additionally, logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of each individual criterion in the IDSA/ATS indications with positive UAT results. RESULTS: Among 1941 patients, UATs were positive for SP in 81 (4.2%) and for LP in 32 (1.6%). IDSA/ATS indications had 61% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 49-71%) and 39% specificity (95% CI 37-41%) for SP, and 63% sensitivity (95% CI 44-79%) and 35% specificity (95% CI 33-37%) for LP. No clinical characteristics were strongly associated with positive SP UATs, while features associated with positive LP UATs were hyponatremia, fever, diarrhea, and recent travel. CONCLUSIONS: Recommended indications for SP and LP urinary antigen testing in the IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines have poor sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with positive tests; future CAP guidelines should consider other strategies for determining which patients should undergo urinary antigen testing."

Distinguishing a true co-infection from cross reactivity is often challenging as the diagnosis is mostly dependent on serological testing. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old male presented with worsening dyspnea, cough with yellow sputum, diarrhea and fever of 2-days duration. Patient had history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate and leflunomide), treated pulmonary tuberculosis and 30-pack-year smoking. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial changes with left lower lobe infiltrate. On day 5, his urine antigen for L pneumophila serogroup 1 was reported positive. The following day his serum M pneumoniae IgM antibody titers were reported elevated at 6647 U/mL. Patient was started on antibiotics and placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with possible Legionella and Mycoplasma co-infection. OUTCOMES: Sputum Mycoplasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum cold agglutinins were obtained on day 6 and later reported negative. He was treated with azithromycin for 10 days with clinical improvement. LESSONS: Serological testing alone is an indirect measure with poor sensitivity and specificity and has its own limitations. Urine antigen detection confirms L pneumophila serogroup 1 infection in a patient with suggestive symptoms. However, diagnosis of M pneumonia should be based on combination of tests including serology and PCR to confirm true co-infection."

We aimed to assess both testing for atypical pathogens and their prevalence in hospitalized patients with CAP worldwide, especially in relation with disease severity. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the GLIMP database, an international, multicentre, point-prevalence study of adult patients admitted for CAP in 222 hospitals across 6 continents in 2015, was performed. The study evaluated frequency of testing for atypical pathogens, including L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and their prevalence. Risk factors for testing and prevalence for atypical pathogens were assessed through univariate analysis. RESULTS: Among 3702 CAP patients 1250 (33.8%) underwent at least one test for atypical pathogens. Testing varies greatly among countries and its frequency was higher in Europe than elsewhere (46.0% vs. 12.7%, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Detection of L. pneumophila urinary antigen was the most common test performed worldwide (32.0%). Patients with severe CAP were less likely to be tested for both atypical pathogens considered together (30.5% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.009) and specifically for legionellosis (28.3% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.003) than the rest of the population. Similarly, L. pneumophila testing was lower in ICU patients. At least one atypical pathogen was isolated in 62 patients (4.7%), including M. pneumoniae (26/251 patients, 10.3%), L. pneumophila (30/1186 patients, 2.5%), and C. pneumoniae (8/228 patients, 3.5%). Patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens were significantly younger, showed less cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic comorbidities in comparison to adult patients hospitalized due to non-atypical pathogen CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for atypical pathogens in patients admitted for CAP in poorly standardized in real life and does not mirror atypical prevalence in different settings. Further evidence on the impact of atypical pathogens, expecially in the low-income countries, is needed to guidelines implementation."

Among diagnostic tests for CAP, urine antigen detection of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila is widely accepted due to the simplicity of collection and the rapidity of the test results. Areas covered: This comprehensive review outlines the urinary antigen tests available, discusses their sensitivity and specificity, and assesses the usefulness of their results as the basis for targeted therapy. Expert commentary: There have been advances in urine antigen detection tests for patients with CAP. New methodologies show greater sensitivity, detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in a single test, and also detect pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, urine antigen detection tests have shown a high specificity, which means that a positive result practically indicates the causative pathogen of CAP. Therefore, a positive result can lead to a targeted therapy that is likely to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of resistance and adverse events. However, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of urine antigen detection tests with regard to clinical outcomes."

To date, only 11 cases of Legionnaire's Disease in pregnancy have been reported [2-11], though this small number could possibly be attributed to underdiagnoses and underdocumentation. In this paper, we present a 31-year-old Hispanic female, gravida 4, para 1 from the southwest United States who presented with a 3 week history of fever, worsening cough, dyspnea on exertion, and hypoxemia. Chest x-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates, with positive serology for legionella IgM and IgG (1:250 and 1:640 respectively) as well as positive urinary antigen. Despite appropriate treatment with azithromycin 500 mg, she continued to have dyspnea and mild respiratory distress. Upon follow up, mother and fetus initially remained stable without any signs of sequelae from Legionnaire's disease, but the patient miscarried 5 weeks after second admission to hospital. The chest x-ray eventually cleared up after almost 21 days of azithromycin."

Pathogen-specific clinical symptoms are often lacking, and it is difficult to detect atypical pathogens by culture methods. The use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods enables testing for many pathogens simultaneously in a single analysis. Aim: To determine the role of atypical pathogens in children hospitalized with CAP. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted throughout a 2-year period from August 2015 to September 2017. It included 400 Egyptian children hospitalized with clinical diagnosis of CAP at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Sputum samples were collected from lower respiratory tract of all enrolled patients by mucus trap catheter for identification of Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia by using multiplex real-time PCR. Results: Among the 400 CAP patients enrolled in this study, atypical pathogens were detected in 12/400 (3%) patients. Bordetella pertussis was detected in 2% of cases, and it was responsible for CAP in 8/104 (7.69%) infants in the age stratum &lt;= 4 months; compared with pertussis-negative cases, pertussis-positive cases were younger and incompletely vaccinated (P values were 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1% of cases, all were among the age stratum &gt; 4 months &lt;= 59 months in 4/272 (1.47%) children. Conclusion: In early infancy, Bordetella pertussis causes a significant proportion of hospitalized CAP cases; all were &lt;= 4 months old and incompletely vaccinated. This finding could suggest the role of maternal immunization in developing countries."

Ventilation-associated lung-injury can be avoided by low-pressure, low-volume ventilation. Potential use of ECMO in case of refractory hypoxemia beside modern ventilatory therapy can be considered. Increasing numbers of respiratory ECMO runs are seen worldwide, though the efficacy remains controversial. The authors present the first successful venovenous-ECMO treatment in severe ARDS in our Institute. We report the case of a 67-year-old male who was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia caused by Legionella. Despite empirical and later targeted antibiotic therapy, severe ARDS with sepsis evolved. Neither ventilation nor prone position resulted in permanent improvement in oxygenation. The patient was referred to our Institute for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) therapy. On admission, blood gas showed severe hypoxemia with mild hypercapnia (PaO2/FiO2: 60, pCO2: 53 mmHg at PEEP: 14 mmHg, PIP: 45 mmHg). X-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates while cardiac impairment (EF: 45%) and dilated right ventricle were seen on echocardiography. Elevated pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP: 41 mmHg) was measured. After implantation of femoral-jugular VV ECMO, oxygen saturation was appropriate with lung protective ventilation (FiO2: 0.5, TV: 3-4 ml/kg). Improving lung function enabled us to stop ECMO after 8 days and further 5 days later the patient was weaned off ventilation. After 21 days of intensive care we discharged him to the referral hospital. By reporting this case we emphasise the potential role of respiratory ECMO. Consideration should be given to increase the contingent of this modality in the Hungarian intensive care in accordance with international practice. Orv Hetil. 2019; 160(6): 235-240."

Immunodeficiency, chemotherapy or chronic steroids use increase the risk of developing LD. Extrapulmonary manifestations of LD include cardiac complications: myocarditis, pericarditis or endocarditis. A CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 51-year-old female with a history of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted due to a high fever, fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea and cough. Chest X-ray and CT showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations and pleural effusion. LD was diagnosed on positive L. pneumophila urinary antigen test. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with substantially decreased ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS), with a pattern resembling reverse takotsubo syndrome (rTTS). The coronary arteries in non-invasive coronary angiography were normal. During therapy with levofloxacin and intravenous immunoglobulins as well as with carvedilol, ramipril and diuretics, gradual clinical improvement with complete normalization of LV function was observed within 5 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed on day 35 revealed only small intramural foci of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with localization not corresponding to the most decreased regional longitudinal strain in the initial echocardiographic examination. The authors suggest that the mechanism of transient LV dysfunction in the case presented may have been of complex nature, including LD myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (with the prevalence of the latter) which has not so far been reported in the literature."

However, it is rare in pregnant women, particularly in the peripartum period. To the best of our knowledge this is the only case of Legionella pneumonia with endometrial sepsis. We are reporting a patient with this rare condition. CASE REPORT The patient was an 18-year-old female, pregnant with her first baby, who developed symptoms of the common cold near term. The patient was seen at another major facility initially and was discharged home with a diagnosis of ""cold"". She was still uncomfortable and came to our facility Aront Ogden Medical Center Elmira, NY, USA, where she had rupture of membranes and underwent C-section. She was suspected clinically of having pneumonia. Initial chest x-ray was negative, but computed tomography (CT)-scan did show bilateral pneumonia. Further workup confirmed the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia and was treated for that as well as for endometritis. She did require Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care during her hospital stay. The patient was seen and evaluated by multiple subspecialties, including Critical Care, Infectious Disease, and Gastroenterology subspecialties. The patient improved steadily, and was later discharged home in the care of her family with a healthy baby and was advised to follow up with her Primary Medical Provider as outpatient. CONCLUSIONS Legionella pneumonia in pregnancy may be more common than we think, and could be easily overlooked in that patient population, have to be in the back mind of medical provider.

Previous studies have identified clinical factors which are more common in Legionella than non-Legionella pneumonia, and scores have been developed to assist in diagnosing cases. Since a Legionella pneumonia outbreak at VA Pittsburgh in 2012, nearly all patients with pneumonia have been tested for Legionella. The purpose of this study was to evaluate distinguishing characteristics between Legionella and non-Legionella pneumonia with the application of universal testing for Legionella in all cases of community-acquired pneumonia. We performed a retrospective case-control study matching Legionella and non-Legionella pneumonia cases occurring in the same month. Between January 2013 and February 2016, 17 Legionella and 54 non-Legionella cases were identified and reviewed. No tested characteristics were significantly associated with Legionella cases after Bonferroni correction. Outcomes of Legionella and non-Legionella pneumonia were comparable. Therefore, in veterans who underwent routine Legionella testing in an endemic area, factors typically associated with Legionella pneumonia were non-discriminatory."

Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup."

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests.

Bacterial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional methods. This study assessed the clinical factors influencing bacterial mPCR results in patients with COP. Patients with COP admitted to a tertiary care hospital between November 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively assessed. Conventional methods included culture-based methods and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial mPCR that could identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia was performed. Bacterial mPCR was performed in a total of 342 patients with COP in the study. Bacterial mPCR alone provided etiology in 99 patients. The total etiologic diagnosis rates improved from 22.2 to 51.1% when bacterial mPCR was added to conventional methods. Additional diagnostic benefits of bacterial mPCR were more prominent in the prior antibiotic non-exposure group (77.8% vs 63.5%, P = 0.015) and in the low-risk group with low CURB 65 score (62.6% vs 44.9%, P = 0.005). Patients who required ICU care, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and patients with any underlying diseases were not associated with the additional pathogen detection rates using bacterial mPCR. By supplementing conventional diagnostic methods with bacterial mPCR-based methods, the overall pathogen detection rates improved in patients with COP. Moreover, the additional diagnostic usefulness of bacterial mPCR was significantly higher in patients without prior antibiotic exposure and in the mild-to-moderate-risk group with lower CURB 65 score."

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide as a first line antibiotic treatment for Legionella pneumonia, but it is unclear which antibiotic leads to optimal clinical outcomes. We compare the effectiveness of fluoroquinolone versus macrolide monotherapy in Legionella pneumonia using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of literature in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to June 1, 2019. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing macrolide vs. fluoroquinolone monotherapy using clinical outcomes in patients with Legionella pneumonia were included. Twenty-one publications out of an initial 2,073 unique records met the selection criteria. Following PRISMA guidelines, two reviewers participated in data extraction. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical cure, time to apyrexia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and the occurrence of complications. RESULTS: Twenty-one publications with 3,525 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age of the population was 60.9 years and 67.2% were men. The mortality rate for patients treated with fluoroquinolones was 6.9% (104/1512) compared to 7.4% (133/1790) among those treated with macrolides. The pooled OR assessing risk of mortality for patients treated with fluoroquinolones vs macrolides was 0.94 (95% CI 0.71-1.25, I2=0%, p= 0.661). Clinical cure, time to apyrexia, LOS, and the occurrence of complications did not differ for patients treated with fluoroquinolones vs. macrolides.

We aimed to identify cumulative incidence, demographic distribution, and undetected disease outbreaks of Legionella pneumonia via positive LUAT in a single eastern Wisconsin health system, with a focus on urban Milwaukee County. Methods: A multilevel descriptive ecologic study was conducted utilizing electronic medical record data from a large integrated health care system of patients who underwent LUAT from 2013 to 2017. A random sample inclusive of all positive tests was reviewed to investigate geodemographic differences among patients testing positive versus negative. Statistical comparisons used chi-squared or 2-sample t-tests; stepwise regression followed by binary logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis. Positive cases identified by LUAT were mapped to locate hotspots; positive cases versus total tests performed also were mapped by zip code. Results: Of all LUAT performed (n=21,599), 0.68% were positive. Among those in the random sample (n=11,652), positive cases by LUAT were more prevalent in the June-November time period (86.2%) and younger patients (59.4 vs 67.7 years) and were disproportionately male (70.3% vs 29.7%) (P<0.0001 for each). Cumulative incidence was higher among nonwhite race/ethnicity (1.91% vs 1.01%, P<0.0001) but did not remain significant on multivariable analysis. Overall, 5507 tests were performed in Milwaukee County zip codes, yielding 82 positive cases by LUAT (60.7% of all positive cases in the random sample). A potential small 2016 outbreak was identified. Conclusions: Cumulative incidence of a positive LUAT was less than 1%. LUAT testing, if done in real time by cooperative health systems, may complement public health detection of Legionella pneumonia outbreaks."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

Methods: From October 2011 to October 2019, 34 patients were diagnosed with SCAP caused by Legionella pneumophila with acute respiratory failure.There were 25 males and 9 females, aged from 17 to 82 years, with a median age of 61 (48, 69) years. According to the prognosis, the patients were divided into a survival group and a death group for comparative analysis.The survival group included 24 patients, 17 males and 7 females, with a median age of 65 (55, 70) years. There were 10 cases in the death group, 8 males and 2 females, with a median age of 53 (50, 58) years. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for risk factors of ICU mortality. Results: The median time of admission to ICU was 7 (5, 11) days, the median time of stay in RICU was 12 (7, 22) days, and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 134 (91, 216) mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). Ten patients died during ICU hospitalization, with a mortality of 29%. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) of death group was 9 (7, 12), which was significantly higher than that of the survival group [4 (3, 8)], P=0.018. The time from onset of pneumonia symptoms to initiation of targeted treatment of the death group was 10 (7, 14) d, which was significantly longer than that of the survival group of [4 (3, 7) d], P=0.019. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that SOFA score (OR=1.461, 95%CI 1.041-2.051, P=0.028) and the time from onset of pneumonia symptoms to initiation of targeted treatment (OR=1.293, 95%CI 1.029-1.625, P=0.027) were independent risk factors for hospital mortality. Conclusions: The ICU mortality of severe legionella pneumonia was high. Critical organ dysfunctions and delayed initial targeted treatment were related with the increase of ICU mortality."

","SPECIES:Legionella gresiliensisID:32727982TITLE:Legionellosis in Japan: A Self-inflicted Wound?ABSTRACT:Legionellosis is a serious bacterial infection characterized by atypical pneumonia primarily due to infection with L. pneumophila, and bathing can be a potential cause of this infection. Legionellosis was first identified in 1977, and it is caused by Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Legionella. Legionellosis remains an important public health threat, particularly in Japan, where the population is rapidly aging, thereby becoming more at risk for developing severe disease and accompanying life-threatening pneumonia. The bacteria are most commonly transmitted via the inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced and broadcast via water sprays, jets or mists. Infection can also occur via the aspiration of contaminated water or ice, or through inhalation of contaminated dust. Because the signs and symptoms of LD, as well as radiographic imaging are similar to pneumonia caused by other pathogens, a specific diagnostic test is required, such as a urine antigen detection test. Six clinical and laboratory parameters, a high body temperature, a non-productive cough, low serum sodium and platelet counts, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and c-reactive protein concentrations can be used to reliably predict the likelihood of LD. The first choices for chemotherapy are fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotic drugs. The main goals of LD prevention measures are 1) the prevention of microbial growth and biofilm formation, 2) the removal of all biofilm formed on equipment and in facilities, 3) minimizing aerosol splash and spread, and 4) minimizing bacterial contamination from external sources. It is apparent that, in Japan, where hot spring (onsen) bathing is common among aged people, strict regulations need to be in place - and enforced - to ensure that all Japanese onsens and spas provide a safe environment and undertake regular, effective infection control practices."

These agents are mostly associated with infection in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these pathogens among patients with CAP attending outpatient clinics in Tehran. A cross-sectional study was carried out of 150 patients attending to educational hospitals in Tehran with CAP. M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected by PCR assay, targeting the P1 adhesion gene, macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively from throat swabs obtained from each patient. A total of 86 (57.3%) of 150 patients were women; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 35-65 years). M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 37 (24.7%), 25 (16.7%) and 11 (7.3%) patients respectively; of these, 66 patients (44%) were infected at least by one of these three pathogens. The frequency of L. pneumophila was significantly higher among patients over 60 years old (p 0.03). Coinfection was detected in seven patients (4.7%); six were infected by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and only one was infected by L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent agent of atypical CAP, and L. pneumophila was more likely to infect elderly rather than younger people. Further studies on the prevalence of CAP and its aetiologic agents are needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CAP patients."

In Switzerland, the number of LD cases, captured by the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases, has more than doubled since 2008. This study aims to investigate this increase, contextualizing disease surveillance data with denominator data, which is not routinely available, i.e., the number of tests performed for Legionella spp. We collected the testing data for Legionella spp. of 14 Swiss diagnostic laboratories and calculated the positivity, defined as the proportion of the number of positive tests to the number of tests performed. The number of positive tests increased proportionally to the number of tests performed; hence, the positivity remained stable. However, the cause of the increase in test volume is unclear and has a large impact on the interpretation of the positivity curve. Further, the test outcome was found to be dependent on regional determinants, and the diagnostic method applied. The lack of understanding if and at which stage LD is considered in current case management of pneumonia patients limits the interpretation of observed heterogeneities in incidence or underestimation of LD in Switzerland. The absence of (or non-adherence to) existing guidelines and the heterogeneity in diagnostic testing hampers the comparison of data in the Swiss public health context. Therefore, diagnostic procedures should be harmonised across Switzerland and adherence to national LD management guidelines supported."

Although co-infections have been previously reported, the co-existence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila is exceedingly rare. Despite the fact that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common etiology in the majority of cases, atypical organisms such as Legionella pneumophila should be considered as etiologic agents among all CAP cases that require hospitalization. Unlike Legionella, extra-pulmonary findings are uncommon in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. In this report, the authors describe an unusual case of septic shock resulting from a combined Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection associated with rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and acute liver injury."

PATIENT CONCERNS: This case study reports on the fatal incident of a patient, initially diagnosed with pneumonia, and subsequently diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by a new sequence type (ST) of Legionella. DIAGNOSIS: It is speculated that the patient acquired Legionnaires' disease from a contaminated water source. Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed using the Legionella urinary antigen assay and bacterial cultures of respiratory secretions; Legionella pneumophilia Type 1 was also identified through serological testing. Sequence-based typing of the cultured bacterium revealed it to be a previously unidentified species, and it was named ST2345 new-type. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to the treatment of Legionnaires' disease, blood samples taken on the second day of admission showed a co-infection of Candida tropicalis, which was treated with anti-fungal treatment. The patient improved after a week, however, on the seventh day of administration lower respiratory secretions showed the growth of Klebsiella pneumonia, indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia. OUTCOMES: Despite active treatment, the patient passed away due to multiple organ failure. As this was a fatal case, further research is needed to determine whether the critical condition of this case was related to the virulence of the novel Legionella strain. CONCLUSION: A key finding of this study is that treatment for suspected Legionnaires' disease must be administered rapidly, as infection with Legionella may give rise to secondary pathogenic infections."

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury. METHODS: In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases). RESULTS: We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase >=5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to >=1.5 times baseline or increase by >=27 mumol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases.

Bacterial co-infections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in respiratory viral infections; however, microbiological and antibiotic data related to COVID-19 are sparse. Adequate use of antibiotics in line with antibiotic stewardship (ABS) principles is warranted during the pandemic. We performed a retrospective study of clinical and microbiological characteristics of 140 COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 to a German University hospital, with a focus on bacterial co-infections and antimicrobial therapy. The final date of follow-up was 6 May 2020. Clinical data of 140 COVID-19 patients were recorded: The median age was 63.5 (range 17-99) years; 64% were males. According to the implemented local ABS guidelines, the most commonly used antibiotic regimen was ampicillin/sulbactam (41.5%) with a median duration of 6 (range 1-13) days. Urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus peumoniae were negative in all cases. In critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (n = 50), co-infections with Enterobacterales (34.0%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (18.0%) were detected. Blood cultures collected at admission showed a diagnostic yield of 4.2%. Bacterial and fungal co-infections are rare in COVID-19 patients and are mainly prevalent in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of antimicrobial therapy on therapeutic outcome in COVID-19 patients to prevent antimicrobial overuse.

The median mortality rate varies from 4 to 11%, but it is higher in patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of this study is to identify predictors of ICU admission in patients with LP. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, observational study conducted in an academic tertiary-care hospital in Pisa, Italy. Adult patients with LP consecutively admitted to study center from October 2012 to October 2019. RESULTS: During the study period, 116 cases of LP were observed. The rate of ICU admission was 20.7% and the overall 30-day mortality rate was 12.1%. Mortality was 4.3% in patients hospitalized in medical wards versus 41.7% in patients transferred to ICU (p < 0.001). The majority of patients (74.1%) received levofloxacin as definitive therapy, followed by macrolides (16.4%), and combination of levofloxacin plus a macrolide (9.5%). In the multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR 8.28, CI 95% 2.11-35.52, p = 0.002), bilateral pneumonia (OR 10.1, CI 95% 2.74-37.27, p = 0.001), and cardiovascular events (OR 10.91, CI 95% 2.83-42.01, p = 0.001), were independently associated with ICU admission, while the receipt of macrolides/levofloxacin therapy within 24 h from admission was protective (OR 0.20, CI 95% 0.05-0.73, p = 0.01). Patients who received a late anti-Legionella antibiotic (> 24 h from admission) underwent urinary antigen test later compared to those who received early active antibiotic therapy (2 [2-4] vs. 1 [1-2] days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission to ICU carries significantly increased mortality in patients with diagnosis of LP. Initial therapy with an antibiotic active against Legionella (levofloxacin or macrolides) reduces the probability to be transferred to ICU and should be provided in all cases until Legionella etiology is excluded."

Even though LD has been reported from many parts of the world, only sporadic cases have been reported in India. During February 2015-January 2020, we enrolled 597 patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia and tested respiratory secretions for Legionella spp. by using real-time PCR, and culture. A commercial urinary antigen test (UAT) was also used to detect the Legionella pneumophila (Lp) serogroup 1 antigen in urine. An LD case was defined as a patient with pneumonia and positive results for Legionella spp. infections determined by real-time PCR (from any respiratory specimen) or culture or UAT. Demographic data, risk factors, clinical, radiological, and outcome data of Lp-positive and Lp-negative patients were compared using logistic regression. Over the study period, 14 (2.3%) patients were positive for Legionella spp. infections by real-time PCR and UAT; eight (57%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and four (28.6%) in-hospital deaths occurred. Bivariate analysis showed that renal disease, neurological conditions, confusion, leukocytosis, and requirement of oxygen support were more common in the Lp-positive group than in the Lp-negative group. However, multivariate analysis failed to confirm most of these differences; renal disease was the only independent variable remaining significant. All test methods have intrinsic limitations in identifying Legionella; therefore, more than one testing method should be used. Application of molecular assays including real-time PCR has great value because of its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid diagnostic potency. Increased awareness and improved diagnostic testing could facilitate early detection of cases, pathogen-directed therapy, and improved outcomes for patients."

However, diagnosis of LP with negative UAT results (LPNUAT) is challenging. We investigated the clinical and radiological features of LPNUAT. METHODS: We retrospectively collected LP cases with positive UAT (LPPUAT) and cases of suspected LP with negative UAT that were examined by Legionella culture between July 2014 and March 2020. We investigated the clinical and CT findings for LP that showed negative UAT results and was diagnosed by culture and compared these findings with those for other pneumonias suspicious for LP with negative results in UAT and Legionella culture (OPSLP). RESULTS: Eight LPNUAT, 20 LPPUAT, and 19 OPSLP cases were included in this study. There were no significant differences in the clinical and CT findings between LPPUAT and LPNUAT when examined by UAT. In LPNUAT, dyspnea, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and bilateral lesions were more commonly observed and inflammatory changes and the number of affected lobes were significantly higher when examined by culture than when examined by UAT. Comparison to OPSLP, LPNUAT did not show such differences, but rather showed disturbances in consciousness, hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, lobar consolidation was observed more frequently and bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules were observed less frequently in LPNUAT. CONCLUSIONS: LP characteristics such as disturbance of consciousness, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, lobar consolidation, and less bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodule contribute to the diagnosis of LP in patients with negative UAT results."

We included adults with a principal diagnosis code for pneumonia (or a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure or sepsis with secondary diagnosis of pneumonia) if they also received treatment for pneumonia by hospital day 1. We categorized Legionella-tested patients by test result, identified patient characteristics associated with testing and test result, and examined seasonal and regional patterns of Legionella pneumonia (LP) diagnoses. Empiric therapy for LP was defined as a macrolide, quinolone, or doxycycline, administered on each of the first 2 hospital days. RESULTS: Of 166,689 eligible patients, 43,070 (26%) were tested for Legionella, and 642 (1.5%) tested positive. While only 36% of tests were ordered from June-October, 70% of positive tests occurred during this time. Only 30% of patients with hyponatremia and 32% with diarrhea and 27% in the ICU were tested. Of positive patients, 495/642 (77%) had received empiric Legionella therapy. LP patients did not have more severe presentation. They had more late decompensation, but similar mortality to patients without LP. INTERPRETATION: Legionella is an uncommon cause of CAP, occurring primarily from late spring through early autumn. Testing is uncommon, even among patients with risk factors, and many positive patients failed to receive empiric coverage for LP."

Despite established guidelines for empirical therapy, several factors may influence etiology and, consequently, antibiotic choices. The aims of this study were to analyze the etiology of CAP in adults admitted to a northern Portugal University Hospital and evaluate the yield of the different methods used to reach an etiological diagnosis, as well as analyze of the impact of patient demographic and clinical features on CAP etiology. We retrospectively analyzed 1901 cases of CAP with hospitalization. The diagnostic performance increased significantly when blood and sputum cultures were combined with urinary antigen tests. The most frequent etiological agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae (45.7%), except in August, when it was overtaken by gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Legionella pneumophila infections. Viral infections were almost exclusive to winter and spring. A negative microbiological result was associated with increasing age, non-smoking and lack of both blood/sputum cultures. Younger age was a predictor for S. pneumoniae, Influenza and L. pneumophila infections. Active smoking without any previously known respiratory disease was a risk factor for legionellosis. COPD was associated with Haemophilus influenzae cases, while dementia was typical in GNB and S. aureus patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart disease were negative predictors of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively. P. aeruginosa was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 13.02, 95% CI 2.94-57.7). This study highlights the importance of a comprehensive microbiological diagnostic workup and provides clues to predicting the most probable CAP causative agents, based on a patient's clinical profile. These may be taken into account when establishing first line antibiotherapy."

Legionnaires' disease is an illness characterized by pneumonia that has a summer/early fall seasonality due to favorable conditions for Legionella growth and exposure. Legionella proliferate in warm water environments and stagnant sections of indoor plumbing and cooling systems. During the ongoing pandemic crisis, exposures to aerosolized water from recently reopened office or retail buildings should be considered as an epidemiologic risk factor for Legionella exposure and an indication to test. The majority of Legionnaires' disease cases occurring each year are not diagnosed, and some experts recommend that all patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia without a known etiology be tested for Legionella infection. Proper diagnosis can increase the likelihood of appropriate and timely antibiotic treatment, identify potential clusters of disease, and facilitate source attribution."

However, reports of ocular lesions due to Legionnaire's disease are limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient with Legionnaire's disease presenting as bilateral central scotomata due to retinal lesions. The patient consulted due to fever and bilateral central scotomata, as well as other extrapulmonary symptoms. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed bilateral accumulations of fluid under the retina, and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral exudative retinal detachment. Later, Legionnaire's disease was confirmed by pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and positive urinary antigen for Legionella pneumophila. After administration of antibiotics, the bilateral central scotomata and bilateral subretinal fluid accumulations completely resolved, as did the other extrapulmonary symptoms and the pulmonary infiltrates. Thus, the bilateral central scotomata due to exudative retinal detachment were thought to be caused by Legionnaire's disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that Legionnaire's disease can present as bilateral central scotomata. We may consider the possibility of extrapulmonary involvement complicating Legionnaire's disease when we encounter bilateral ocular lesions in patients with fever and pneumonia."

OBJECTIVES: To report the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this unusual combination, and to describe the execution and results of our environmental and epidemiologic investigations. METHODS: Serial serologic testing was conducted 1, 4 and 7 weeks after initial presentation. Water samples from the patients' residence were cultured for Legionella. Follow-up cultures were taken from identical points at 2 weeks and at 3 months after the initial survey. RESULTS: Both patients initially expressed a non-specific rise in anti-Legionella immunoglobulin M titers to multiple serotypes. By week 4 a definite pattern of specifically elevated IgG titers became apparent, with patient 1 demonstrating a rise in specific anti-L. pneumophila 12 IgG titer and patient 2 an identical response to L. jordanis. At 4 weeks both patients were positive for both IgM and IgG anti-R. conorii antibodies at a titer &gt; or = 1:100. Heavy growth of Legionella was found in water sampled from the shower heads in the rooms of both patients. Indirect immunofluorescence of water cultures was positive for L. pneumophila 12 and for L. jordanis. CONCLUSIONS: Although most cases of community-acquired Legionella pneumonia in our region appear simultaneously with at least one other causative agent, co-infection with R. conorii is unusual and has not been reported to date.

Among these infections, Aspergillus is a common cause of fatal pneumonia. Owing to the precarious clinical condition of many patients who acquire invasive mold infections, clinicians often treat them on the basis of radiographic findings, such as the halo sign. However, in patients who do not respond to treatment or who have uncommon presentations, bronchoscopy or lung biopsy looking for other pathogens should be considered. This study describes two cases in which the radiographic halo signs characteristic of Aspergillus were in fact due to Legionella jordanis, a pathogen that has been culture proven only in two patients previously (both of whom had underlying lung pathology) and diagnosed by serologic evidence in several other patients. In immunocompromised patients, Legionella can present as a cavitary lesion. Thus, presumptive treatment for this organism should be considered in post-transplant patients who do not have a classic presentation for invasive fungal infection and/or who fail to respond to conventional treatment. These cases illustrate the importance of obtaining tissue cultures to differentiate among the wide variety of pathogens present in this patient population."

Multicentric prospective study of 274 hospitalized patients.ABSTRACT:In 1982 and 1983 a prospective study was carried out involving 274 adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired acute pneumonia. The results of the bacteriological and serological diagnoses are presented here. Conventional and standardized bacteriological methods were used. All the serodiagnoses of LD were carried out with the 13 antigens produced by the ""Centre National de Reference"" (L. pneumophila 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; L. micdadei; L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. jordanis; L. gormanii; L. longbeachae 1 and 2). Standardized criteria were used for the interpretation of results. Conventional methods were used for the other serodiagnoses. Because the laboratory results had been interpreted very rigorously, an etiological diagnosis was established only in 51% of pneumonia cases. Other reasons, such as the frequent prescription of antibiotics prior to hospitalization, may explain why no aetiology could be determined in 49% of cases. The microbial agents responsible were: S. pneumoniae, Legionella and M. pneumoniae in 62% of cases; H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, Chlamydia and S. aureus in 21.6%; and viruses in 8.6%. 29 (10%) of the 274 pneumonia cases were caused by Legionella, being second to S. pneumoniae. The preponderance of L. pneumophila was striking (22 cases), 3 Legionella strains were isolated (L. pneumophila serogroup 1:2 strains, serogroup 6:1 strain). Three associated or successive infections were observed (influenza, Leptospirosis, Coxiella infection). As regards the other bacteria, implication of the strain isolated was based on its multiple occurrence in several samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Between 1992-1993, 99 acute and convalescent sera were collected from patients with CAP of unknown etiology. The sera were tested using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) against the following antigens: Legionella pneumophila, serogroups 3,5,6 and 7 and L. longbeachae, L. anisa, L. bozemanii and Legionella-Like Amoebal Pathogens (LLAP). A four-fold rise in titer to at least one of the antigens tested, was seen in 14% of patients; 8% to L. bozemanii, 4% to L. anisa, 2% to S. lyticum, 2% to LLAP 10 and 1% each to LLAP 1, 6 and 9. Two patients reacted to several antigens. These results indicate that other species of legionella may be important in the etiology of CAP. L. bozemanii was the organism identified in the majority of these infections.

A further two patients were observed to have high titres consistent with previous exposure but earlier serum samples were not available for comparison. No patients had antibody responses to Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1 and 2. L. longbeachae was not cultured from respiratory secretions from patients or from the environment within the unit.

The ICU is located on the first floor of the same tower and receives external air from two vents, one on the eastern and the other on the western aspect. All patients with serological evidence of L. longbeachae infection were concomitantly infected with multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and were located in bays on the eastern side of the unit. A large pigeon nest was discovered within 1-2 m of the eastern vent. Following removal of the birds' nest, no further cases were seen on routine screening of all patients within the unit over the next eight weeks. Alternatively, seroconversion may have been related to demolition of the adjacent nine-storey nurses home.

Rapid and accurate detection of legionellae is important for diagnosis and treatment of patients. In order to detect legionellae, a new DNA amplification method was designed and evaluated. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method amplifies DNA with high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity under isothermal conditions at 65 degrees C. This method employs a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA. The primers targeting 16S rRNA gene were designed in order to detect a wide range of Legionella species. We could specifically detect Legionella species including Legionella pneumophila, Legionella anisa, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffii, Legionella erythra, Legionella feeleii, Legionella gormanii, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella micdadei, Legionella oakridgensis, and Legionella sainthelensi.

And to describe the public health response to an identified subgroup of Legionella infections. METHODS: The case definition was ""a person admitted to Wellington or Hutt Hospital between 29 October 2003 and 9 November 2003 with severe pneumonia"". The cluster was initially investigated by interviewing patients to obtain histories of activities and exposures, and by reviewing medical notes. Medical teams sent further clinical specimens for testing (sputum for polymerase chain reaction [PCR], convalescent Legionella serology, and urine for Legionella antigen testing). Further investigation of Legionella pneumophila cases involved obtaining detailed exposure histories, environmental investigations at the suspect source of infection, and taking water and biofilm swabs for Legionella detection and serotyping. RESULTS: Three cases from the cluster were confirmed as, or compatible with, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2. With the other three cases there was evidence of infection with L. longbeachae (two cases) or respiratory syncytial virus (one case). Exposure histories for the L. pneumophila cases revealed that the three cases had visited a Lower Hutt retail outlet with operating spa pools on display. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was cultured from one of three pools. All pools were positive for Legionella on direct fluorescent antibody testing. CONCLUSIONS: Although unproven, the display spa pools were considered to be the most likely source of Legionella infection in the three cases that had visited the retail outlet. Although Legionella isolated from the pools was a different serogroup from that identified in two cases, the pools were considered to be the most likely source of infection in view of inadequate chlorination of the waters. Public health intervention to address the immediate and longer-term health risks from the pools is described. This is the second outbreak of Legionella pneumophila linked to operating display spa pools in New Zealand and it appears to be the fourth recorded outbreak of Legionnaires' disease associated with operating spa pools on display."

We report a lower limit of incidence (observed incidence) and an upper limit extrapolated to persons not tested or not enrolled in the study. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonia due to Legionella longbeachae requiring hospitalization was 5-29 cases per 100,000 population. No case of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia was observed. The definite C. pneumoniae pneumonia incidence was 3-23 cases per 100,000 population; rates were highest among patients aged &lt;1 year (18-166 cases per 100,000 population) and those aged &gt;or=70 years (23-201 cases per 100,000 population). M. pneumoniae pneumonia had a similar age distribution, with an overall incidence of 6-44 cases per 100,000 population. These pathogens were associated with 15% of all cases of pneumonia. A nonsignificantly higher proportion of patients with pneumonia associated with L. longbeachae, compared with patients with pneumonia associated with M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, required supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation (45% vs. 18%; P&lt;.1). Among patients with atypical pneumonia, only 15% received antibiotics with activity against the associated pathogen. CONCLUSION: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. longbeachae, but not L. pneumophila, are frequently associated with severe pneumonia in rural Thailand. Few patients receive antibiotics that cover atypical pathogens."

However, the annual notification rate for symptomatic disease is only about 0.5 per 100,000 residents in non-epidemic years. The male to female ratio is 2.5 to one and approximately 50% of the cases are at least 60 years of age. Cases have presented more in summer and in the metropolitan areas. Twenty cases of Legionnaires' disease occurred during the summer of 1985-86. A cooling tower was held to be the principal source with aerosols being dispersed up to three kilometers away during an atmospheric thermal inversion. A subsequent outbreak of 22 L. longbeachae serogroup 1 infections had no marked geographic clustering. The outbreak commenced in spring and cases were distinguished as active gardeners. L. longbeachae was found in garden soil and it is hypothesised that this soil inhabitant can become aerosolised and inhaled during gardening. The potential for primary prevention of Legionnaires' disease is discussed in relation to water-handling equipment and the need for early precautionary treatment of all community-acquired pneumonia as suspect Legionnaires' disease is emphasised."

All case patients had exposure to commercially manufactured growing media or potting soils, commonly known as multipurpose compost (MPC), in greenhouse conditions, prior to disease onset. Two patients had been using the same brand of MPC but the clinical isolates were distinct genotypically by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. However, an indistinguishable AFLP profile was also found in an environmental isolate from the supply of MPC used by each patient. The third patient was diagnosed by immunofluorescent antibody serology only; however, the MPC to which this patient was exposed contained L. longbeachae sg 1 in large quantities (80 000 c.f.u. g(-1)). The fourth patient was L. longbeachae sg 1 culture-positive, but L. longbeachae was not identified from 10 samples of garden composting material. As compost is commonly used, but L. longbeachae infection seemingly rare, further work is required to ascertain (i) the prevalence and predictors of L. longbeachae in compost and (ii) the conditions which facilitate transmission and generate an aerosol of the bacteria. As most cases of legionellosis are diagnosed by urinary antigen that is Legionella pneumophila-specific and does not detect infection with L. longbeachae, patients in cases of community-acquired pneumonia with a history of compost exposure should have serum and respiratory samples sent to a specialist Legionella reference laboratory for analysis."

This study delivers the first comprehensive survey of composts commonly available in the UK for the presence of Legionella species. Twenty-two store-bought composts, one green-waste compost and one home-made compost were tested for Legionella by culture methods on BCYE-alpha medium, and the findings were confirmed by macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) speciation. Twenty-two of the samples were retested after an enrichment period of 8 weeks. In total, 15 of 24 composts tested positive for Legionella species, a higher level of contamination than previously seen in Europe. Two isolates of Legionella pneumophila were identified, and Legionella longbeachae serogroup 1 was found to be one of the most commonly isolated species. L. longbeachae infection would not be detected by routine Legionella urinary antigen assay, so such testing should not be used as the sole diagnostic technique in atypical pneumonia cases, particularly where there is an association with compost use. The occurrence of Legionella in over half of the samples tested indicates that compost could pose a public health risk.

The Legionella strains were isolated from bronchoscopy specimens (32 strains) and a blood culture (1 strain) and were identified by sequencing analysis of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. The 33 strains involved 12 Legionella species or subspecies: 15 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, 3 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri or L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei, 4 strains of ""L. donaldsonii,"" 3 strains of L. micdadei, and one each of L. bozemanae, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. parisiensis, L. sainthelensi, and Legionella sp. strain D5382. All patients except one asymptomatic carrier showed pneumonia, including one with concurrent bacteremia. Nine patients died, with this infection being the immediate cause of death in six. Twenty-seven patients had underlying hematologic malignancies. Twenty-three patients were leukopenic. Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp.

The aim was to determine the utility of front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR in a severe respiratory infection algorithm. METHODS: L. pneumophila and Legionella species duplex real-time PCR was carried out on 1944 specimens from hospitalised patients over a 4 year period in Edinburgh, UK. RESULTS: L. pneumophila was detected by PCR in 49 (2.7%) specimens from 36 patients. During a LD outbreak, combined L. pneumophila respiratory PCR and urinary antigen testing had optimal sensitivity and specificity (92.6% and 98.3% respectively) for the detection of confirmed cases. Legionella species was detected by PCR in 16 (0.9%) specimens from 10 patients. The 5 confirmed and 1 probable cases of Legionella longbeachae LD were both PCR and antibody positive. CONCLUSIONS: Front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR is a valuable addition to urinary antigen testing as part of a well-defined algorithm. Cases of LD due to L. longbeachae might be considered laboratory-confirmed when there is a positive Legionella species PCR result and detection of L. longbeachae specific antibody response."

While microbiological and epidemiological studies have identified exposure to growing media as a risk factor for infection, little is known about the differences regarding disease risk factors, clinical features and outcomes of infection with L. longbeachae when compared with L. pneumophila. A nested case-case study was performed comparing 12 L. longbeachae cases with 25 confirmed L. pneumophila cases. Fewer L. longbeachae infected patients reported being smokers [27% (95% CI 2-52%) vs. 68% (95% CI 50-86%), P = 0.034] but more L. longbeachae patients experienced breathlessness [67% (95% CI 40-94%) vs. 28% (95% CI 10-46%), P = 0.036]. Significantly more L. longbeachae-infected patients received treatment in intensive care [50% (95% CI 22-78%) vs. 12% (95% CI 0-25%), P = 0.036]. However, the differences in diagnostic methods between the two groups may have led to only the most severe cases of L. longbeachae being captured by the surveillance system. No differences were observed in any of the other pre-hospital symptoms assessed. Our results highlight the similarity of Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae, and reinforce the importance of diagnostic tools other than the urinary antigen assays for the detection of non-L. pneumophila species. Unfortunately, cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Legionella species will continue to be underdiagnosed unless routine testing criteria changes."

Clinical reports of L. longbeachae infection are limited to case reports or small case series, and culture-confirmed cases. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of L. longbeachae pneumonia in a large case series from Christchurch, New Zealand during a 4-year period when both PCR and cultures were used as routine diagnostic tools for Legionnaires' disease. Cases of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia were reviewed for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 107 cases of L. longbeachae infection were identified by PCR and/or culture. The median age was 65 years (range 25-90 years), 63% were male, and most became unwell during spring or summer. Presenting clinical features were similar to those reported for community-acquired pneumonia, with headache, myalgia and diarrhoea being common. Elevated C-reactive protein, hyponatraemia and abnormal liver function tests were also common. History of productive cough, involvement of both lungs, and high bacterial load were independently associated with culture of Legionella from lower respiratory samples. One quarter required intensive care unit admission, and 5% died. Among patients given antimicrobial therapy before admission, those given agents without anti-Legionella activity were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed patients diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 between March 2001 and June 2016. We examined the clinical characteristics, including symptoms, laboratory findings, radiologic findings, pneumonia severity, initial treatment and prognosis. We also calculated scores using the six-point scoring system in these patients. Furthermore, we compared the clinical characteristics and six-point scores between non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients among hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients enrolled prospectively between October 2010 and July 2016. RESULTS: Eleven patients had pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1; their median age was 66 years and 8 patients (72.7%) were male. The most common pathogen was L. pneumophila serogroup 3 (6/11), followed by L. pneumophila serogroup 9 (3/11), L. pneumophila serogroup 6 (1/11) and L. longbeachae (1/11). Non-specific symptoms, such as fever and cough, were common. Six patients (54.5%) had liver enzyme elevation, but no patient developed hyponatraemia at &lt;130 mEq/L. Nine patients (81.8%) showed lobar pneumonia and 7 patients (63.6%) manifested with consolidation and ground-glass opacity. Patients with mild to moderate severity comprised 10 (90.9%) by CURB-65 and 5 (45.5%) by the Pneumonia Severity Index. Of all patients, 4 were admitted to the intensive care unit and 3 died despite appropriate empiric therapy. The clinical characteristics were not significantly different between non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients (n = 23). At a cut-off value of &gt;= 2 points, the sensitivity of the six-point scoring system was 54.5% (6/11) for non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and 95.7% (22/23) for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 pneumonia varied in severity from mild to severe and the clinical characteristics were often non-specific.

The results of the bacteriological and serological diagnoses are presented here. Conventional and standardized bacteriological methods were used. All the serodiagnoses of LD were carried out with the 13 antigens produced by the ""Centre National de Reference"" (L. pneumophila 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; L. micdadei; L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. jordanis; L. gormanii; L. longbeachae 1 and 2). Standardized criteria were used for the interpretation of results. Conventional methods were used for the other serodiagnoses. Because the laboratory results had been interpreted very rigorously, an etiological diagnosis was established only in 51% of pneumonia cases. Other reasons, such as the frequent prescription of antibiotics prior to hospitalization, may explain why no aetiology could be determined in 49% of cases. The microbial agents responsible were: S. pneumoniae, Legionella and M. pneumoniae in 62% of cases; H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, Chlamydia and S. aureus in 21.6%; and viruses in 8.6%. 29 (10%) of the 274 pneumonia cases were caused by Legionella, being second to S. pneumoniae.

","SPECIES:Legionella longbeachaeID:31196812TITLE:The burden of Legionnaires' disease in New Zealand (LegiNZ): a national surveillance study.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease is under-diagnosed because of inconsistent use of diagnostic tests and uncertainty about whom to test. We assessed the increase in case detection following large-scale introduction of routine PCR testing of respiratory specimens in New Zealand. METHODS: LegiNZ was a national surveillance study done over 1-year in which active case-finding was used to maximise the identification of cases of Legionnaires' disease in hospitals. Respiratory specimens from patients of any age with pneumonia, who could provide an eligible lower respiratory specimen, admitted to one of 20 participating hospitals, covering a catchment area of 96% of New Zealand's population, were routinely tested for legionella by PCR. Additional cases of Legionnaires' disease in hospital were identified through mandatory notification. FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2015, and May 20, 2016, 5622 eligible specimens from 4862 patients were tested by PCR. From these, 197 cases of Legionnaires' disease were detected. An additional 41 cases were identified from notification data, giving 238 cases requiring hospitalisation. The overall incidence of Legionnaires' disease cases in hospital in the study area was 5 4 per 100 000 people per year, and Legionella longbeachae was the predominant cause, found in 150 (63%) of 238 cases. INTERPRETATION: The rate of notified disease during the study period was three-times the average over the preceding 3 years. Active case-finding through systematic PCR testing better clarified the regional epidemiology of Legionnaires' disease and uncovered an otherwise hidden burden of disease. These data inform local Legionnaires' disease testing strategies, allow targeted antibiotic therapy, and help identify outbreaks and effective prevention strategies. The same approach might have similar benefits if applied elsewhere in the world. FUNDING: Health Research Council of New Zealand."

Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup."

In two prospective studies, one involving 110 intensive-care unit (ICU) patients with mainly nosocomial pneumonias and the other 105 patients with community-acquired pneumonias, we investigated the incidence and significance of Legionella pneumophila and non-pneumophila pneumonias on the basis of 17 different main serogroups. In the first study, 14 ICU patients had 15 (13.6%) Legionella pneumonias, which, in 5 cases (33%), were of non-pneumophila etiology. In the second study, 9 patients with community-acquired pneumonias had 10 (9.5%) Legionella pneumonias. Leading this study were 6 L. gormanii infections, followed by 2 L. dumoffii and only 1 L. pneumophila and 1 L. longbeachae pneumonia. Of the total, 22 of 23 patients with Legionnaires' disease suffered from severe basic diseases and complications (acute renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, etc.) predominant among the nosocomial pneumonias. The mortality rate was significant in these patients at 33% (5 patients) in the ICU group and 10% (1 patient) in the group with community-acquired pneumonias. We conclude that non-pneumophila Legionella species should receive more diagnostic and therapeutic consideration in patients with nosocomial or community-acquired pneumonias."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed retrospective Legionella micdadei serologic testing to enhance case finding in transplant patients with pneumonia that lacked a documented microbial etiology, as well as prospective environmental surveillance of water sites and testing for Legionella in clinical specimens. RESULTS: During a 3-month period, 12 cases of Legionella micdadei pneumonia were identified either by culture or serologic testing among 38 renal and cardiac transplant patients. Legionella micdadei isolates from hot water sources were found by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to have a DNA banding pattern that was identical to the isolates from the first 3 culture-positive cases and from 2 cases that occurred 16 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals caring for organ transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed patients must be aware of the possibility of environmental sources of outbreaks of Legionella infection. A first-line screen with the Legionella urine antigen test will identify Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. However, specific cultures in outbreak situations should be considered to identify other Legionella pneumophila serotypes and the nonpneumophila Legionella species."

We describe the development of two molecular assays for the detection of 11 common viral and bacterial agents of CAP and sepsis: influenza virus A, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A), RSV B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Legionella micdadei, Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further, we report the prevalence of carriage of these pathogens in respiratory, skin, and serum specimens from 243 asymptomatic children and adults. The detection of pathogens was done using both a manual enzyme hybridization assay and an automated electronic microarray following reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The analytical sensitivities ranged between 0.01 and 100 50% tissue culture infective doses, cells, or CFU per ml for both detection methods. Analytical specificity testing demonstrated no significant cross-reactivity among 19 other common respiratory organisms. One hundred spiked ""surrogate"" clinical specimens were all correctly identified with 100% specificity (95% confidence interval, 100%). Overall, 28 (21.7%) of 129 nasopharyngeal specimens, 11 of 100 skin specimens, and 2 of 100 serum specimens from asymptomatic subjects tested positive for one or more pathogens, with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus giving 89% of the positive results. Our data suggest that asymptomatic carriage makes the use of molecular assays problematic for the detection of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus in upper respiratory tract secretions; however, the specimens tested showed virtually no carriage of the other nine viral and bacterial pathogens, and the detection of these pathogens should not be a significant diagnostic problem. In addition, slightly less sensitive molecular assays may have better correlation with clinical disease in the case of CAP."

There are no clinical presentations unique to LD and hence accurate laboratory tests are required for early diagnosis. Therefore, we designed a real-time PCR assay that targets the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic spacer region (23S-5S PCR) and allows for detection of all Legionella species and discrimination of L. pneumophila from other Legionella species. In total, 271 isolates representing 50 Legionella species were tested and the assay was validated using 39 culture-positive and 110 culture-negative patient specimens collected between 1989 and 2006. PCR-positive results were obtained with all 39 culture-positive samples (100% sensitivity). Specimens that tested positive according to 23S-5S PCR, but were culture-negative, were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the amplicon or the macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene. In addition to L. pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella cincinnatiensis and Legionella micdadei were identified in the specimens. The assay showed a 7-log dynamic range displaying a sensitivity of 7.5 CFU/mL or three genome equivalents per reaction. Sixty-one specimens containing viruses or bacteria other than Legionellae were negative according to 23S-5S PCR, demonstrating its specificity.

On biopsy specimens, it can appear as an acid-fast bacillus (AFB) and can be mistaken for a member of genus Mycobacterium. As Legionella requires selective media to grow in culture, and the commonly used, commercially available urine antigen test for Legionella only detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup-1, but not L. micdadei, it is important to consider this organism in the differential diagnosis for AFB in immunocompromised hosts. We report a case of L. micdadei infection, which was initially treated empirically for non-tuberculous mycobacteria based on AFB staining of biopsy tissue before the final diagnosis was made. "

The Legionella strains were isolated from bronchoscopy specimens (32 strains) and a blood culture (1 strain) and were identified by sequencing analysis of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. The 33 strains involved 12 Legionella species or subspecies: 15 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, 3 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri or L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei, 4 strains of ""L. donaldsonii,"" 3 strains of L. micdadei, and one each of L. bozemanae, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. parisiensis, L. sainthelensi, and Legionella sp. strain D5382. All patients except one asymptomatic carrier showed pneumonia, including one with concurrent bacteremia. Nine patients died, with this infection being the immediate cause of death in six. Twenty-seven patients had underlying hematologic malignancies. Twenty-three patients were leukopenic. Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp.

Legionella micdadei is a Gram negative bacterium that can stain weakly acid fast. It was first described in 1979 after immunosuppressed patients developed pneumonia at a Pittsburgh VA, initially given the name Pittsburgh Pneumonia Agent. It is the second most common Legionella species causing infection after pneumophila, and typically infects immunocompromised hosts. It is not easy to be cultured which makes diagnosing difficult. Case Presentation. A 31-year-old female with ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and cirrhosis presented with fever, chills, shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain for five days after being started on immunosuppression for autoimmune hepatitis two months earlier. The first chest CT showed small bilateral cavitary nodules. The nodules continued to grow on subsequent imaging despite what was thought to be appropriate therapy. A transthoracic biopsy was performed which grew Legionella micdadei and the patient improved after being treated with levofloxacin. Conclusion. Legionella micdadei is an atypical pathogen known to cause pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. This case highlights a typical presentation of an atypical infection not commonly thought about and should be considered when nodules are growing despite being on broad antimicrobial therapy. "

Historical, microbiological, clinical, and epidemiological review.ABSTRACT:More than 20 species of the Legionellaceae family of bacteria have been discovered since the discovery of Legionella pneumophila. Thirteen have been implicated as causative agents of pneumonia including the Pittsburgh pneumonia agent (Tatlockia micdadei, Legionella micdadei). Although outbreaks of nosocomial pneumonia in immunosuppressed hosts have been well-described, most cases have occurred sporadically in the community. The spectrum of disease ranges from severe life-threatening pneumonia to a self-limiting febrile illness (Pontiac fever). Isolation from the natural aquatic environment has preceded its discovery as agents of human disease in 6 species, while environmental isolation has not yet been obtained for 3 species implicated in disease. The mode of transmission is uncertain, but cases of dual infection by L. pneumophila and the newer species suggests that the epidemiology of these new organisms will be similar to that of L. pneumophila. The antibiotic of choice appears to be erythromycin. The historical background, epidemiology, microbiology, and clinical manifestations of these newly-discovered organisms are reviewed in comparative fashion."

To understand the epidemiology of LD, we reviewed 15-year longitudinal data from a center in Seattle, Washington that cares for both solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We identified all laboratory-confirmed LD and extracted data on species, diagnostic modalities, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes from medical records. Among 32 patients with LD, transplant recipients made up the majority of diagnoses (22, 69%; SOT 10, HCT 12). Approximately 0.8% of transplant recipients who underwent Legionella-specific testing were positive. Non-pneumophila Legionella species (LNLP), which are not detected by urinary antigen test, accounted for half the cases, led by Legionella micdadei (32%). The severity and outcome between Legionella pneumophila and LNLP infections were similar (attributed mortality, 36% vs 27%); all LNLP deaths occurred in transplant recipients with L. micdadei. The clinical and radiological features mimicked other opportunistic pathogens; 32% (n=7) were not on empiric treatment at the time of diagnosis. These data add to the emerging literature describing the importance of LD and highlight the need for both routine Legionella testing on transplant recipients with pulmonary findings and empiric Legionella-active antibiotic therapy."

The results of the bacteriological and serological diagnoses are presented here. Conventional and standardized bacteriological methods were used. All the serodiagnoses of LD were carried out with the 13 antigens produced by the ""Centre National de Reference"" (L. pneumophila 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; L. micdadei; L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. jordanis; L. gormanii; L. longbeachae 1 and 2). Standardized criteria were used for the interpretation of results. Conventional methods were used for the other serodiagnoses. Because the laboratory results had been interpreted very rigorously, an etiological diagnosis was established only in 51% of pneumonia cases. Other reasons, such as the frequent prescription of antibiotics prior to hospitalization, may explain why no aetiology could be determined in 49% of cases. The microbial agents responsible were: S. pneumoniae, Legionella and M. pneumoniae in 62% of cases; H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, Chlamydia and S. aureus in 21.6%; and viruses in 8.6%. 29 (10%) of the 274 pneumonia cases were caused by Legionella, being second to S. pneumoniae. The preponderance of L. pneumophila was striking (22 cases), 3 Legionella strains were isolated (L. pneumophila serogroup 1:2 strains, serogroup 6:1 strain). Three associated or successive infections were observed (influenza, Leptospirosis, Coxiella infection).

They are responsible for less than 10% of legionellosis, but have a propensity to affect people suffering from immunodeficiency. Lung cavitations may also occur in this population. Isolation of L. micdadei on clinical samples requires specific culture media that are not routinely used. Moreover, serologic methods and urinary assays are specific for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (the most frequent serogroup isolated from clinical specimens), and lack sensitivity for diagnosing L. micdadei infection. As a consequence, this diagnosis is difficult to confirm. Case report: We report here a severe case of community-acquired legionellosis due to L. micdadei, in a patient under immunosuppressive medications and high-dose corticosteroids for rheumatoid arthritis. The source of his infection was hypothesized to be his continuous positive airway pressure device, which was regularly cleaned with tap water instead of sterile water, thus potentially resulting in Legionella contamination. Conclusions: L. micdadei must be considered as a possible cause of community-acquired severe pneumonia in case of immunodeficiency. For outpatients, advice concerning the cleaning of aerosols-generating devices at home must be emphasized."

Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup."

Legionella sp responsible for documented nosocomial disease include Legionella pneumophila, Tatlockia micdadei, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffi and Legionella oakridgensis. The clinical presentation is nonspecific although diarrhea occurs frequently. Hyponatremia occurs significantly more frequently in legionnaires' disease than pneumonias caused by other agents. Chest roentgenographic findings are nonspecific, although cavitation can be seen in immunosuppressed patients. Laboratory methods require the use of direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains, culture using selective media, serologic testing, and detection of antigen in urine. The DFA test is not sensitive; however, it does correlate with the severity of disease. Culture from sputa is now feasible. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a promising technique for obtaining specimens. The ideal specimen for culture is that obtained by transtracheal aspiration, which bypasses oropharyngeal contamination. Combination therapy of erythromycin and rifampin is recommended for selected patients. Because the source of the organism is the hospital water distribution system, we recommend routine environmental surveillance, especially in hospitals in which organ transplants are performed. The role of cooling towers as a vector for dissemination of the organism is disputed. Disinfection of the water supply can be accomplished by using heat eradication. Chlorination has generally proven unsatisfactory because of organism persistence as well as corrosive damage to the plumbing system from the chlorine. Both physician awareness and availability of specialized laboratory testing are necessary for the detection of cases."

This newly established bacterial genus, Legionella, includes the agents of Legionnaires' disease, Pittsburgh pneumonia, and several related infections. There are many similarities in the pathology of human infection caused by all the Legionella species. All produce a severe confluent lobular or lobar pneumonia, and abscess formation is not uncommon. A leukocytoclastic inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils and macrophages, ""septic"" vasculitis of small blood vessels, coagulation necrosis, and focal septal disruption are characteristic but not diagnostic features. The inflammatory response is clearly that of a bacterial pneumonia with a necrotizing component, and does not resemble most mycoplasmal, chlamydial, or viral pneumonias. The bacteria can be demonstrated well by special stains. Acid fastness of Legionella micdadei, the cause of Pittsburgh pneumonia, is a helpful presumptive clue to diagnosis. The bacteria can be presumptively speciated in tissue by direct immunofluorescence. In addition, reliable recovery of the organisms on agar media now allows a specific diagnosis to be made. As a group, these infections are properly referred to as the Legionella pneumonias."

A literature review suggests a typical pattern of clinical and radiologic presentation, of which the following case is representative. Eighteen of twenty-one infections have occurred in recipients of cadaveric renal transplants, defining a population at risk. The onset often occurred within days to weeks of bolus doses of corticosteroids. Fever, often accompanied by mild pulmonary symptoms usually developed, coupled with nodular or segmental chest infiltrates which were often well defined or rapidly expansile.

The prevalence of elevated titers of antibody to Legionella pneumophila or L. micdadei among the patients at the time of transplantation (21.6%) was not significantly different from that among kidney donors (13.4%; P greater than .25). Seroconversion occurred in 21 (23.6%) of 89 recipients during the six months after transplantation. Seven recipients who seroconverted were diagnosed as having legionella pneumonia, eight had fever and pneumonitis attributed to other causes but compatible (on clinical grounds) with legionella infection, and six had no clinical evidence of infectious pneumonia. The interval from transplantation to onset of pneumonia was shorter for recipients with evidence of L. micdadei pneumonia than for patients with L. pneumophila pneumonia (P = .006); this finding suggested that the former disease occurred when the recipients were most immunocompromised. The original outbreak of L. micdadei pneumonia was found to have subsided nine months after the last formally recognized case, but infections with L. pneumophila continued to occur thereafter."

Each characteristic has contributed to the delay in perceiving their importance. Mycobacterium chelonei and Myco. fortuitum--which grow slowly, although characterized as ""rapid-growing"" mycobacteria--cause sternal osteomyelitis, pericarditis and endocarditis after cardiac surgery as well as other wound infections after many types of surgery. Myco. chelonei-like organisms have been found to cause ""sterile"" peritonitis in patients receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis. Legionella pneumophila and L. micdadei are fastidious bacteria that were more difficult to detect because they stain poorly with the Gram method. They cause pneumonia and lung abscess, especially in immunocompromised people. Clostridium difficile is an anaerobe that causes toxin-mediated pseudomembranous colitis in persons given antibiotics that inhibit competing gut bacteria. Chylamydia trachomatis, an intracellular organism that has not been grown in vitro, causes pneumonia and conjunctivitis in young infants who acquire the organism from their mothers at birth. Group JK bacteria cause septicemia in patients whose immune responses have been suppressed and must be distinguished from ""diphtheroid"" contaminants in blood cultures. Clinicians, microbiologists and epidemiologists must be alert to the characteristics of these organisms that make them easily overlooked and should also anticipate the existence of other bacteria not yet identified."

An organism identical to the TATLOCK/Pittsburgh pneumonia agent (Legionella micdadei) was the only organism isolated from multiple specimens from lung aspirates and chest tube drainage. The organism was isolated directly on charcoal yeast extract (CYE) agar and classified as identical to the TATLOCK bacterium by direct immunofluorescent staining and by gas-liquid chromatography of cellular fatty acids. The patient's pulmonary infection improved during treatment with penicillin. Serum specimens obtained from the patient during convalescence showed an indirect fluorescent antibody reciprocal titer of 16,000 to his homologous antigen, but he also had titers that were potentially diagnostic against antigens of the six serogroups of Legionella pneumophila and three other Legionella-like organisms. Legionella can be isolated from clinical specimens by the routine use of CYE agar, which should be incorporated as the primary isolation medium for chest fluids and lung specimens.

On the basis of knowledge available at present, the Legionellaceae family accounts for these bacteria. There are five different species in the genus Legionella: L. pneumophila, L. micdadei, L. bozemannii, L. dumoffii and L. gormanii. L. pneumophila occurs most frequently and has six serogroups (Serogroups 1-6), the first of which is the most important. Legionelloses, the diseases caused by these organisms, occur epidemically, endemically or sporadically. In clinical terms, these are acute cases of pneumonia which occur especially frequently in older persons and immunocompromised hosts. The course is severe in such patients. There is increased lethality. Erythromycin, rifampicin and cefoxitin are the most effective antibiotics. After the culture has been made in the suitable milieu and the material obtained by pulmonary aspiration has been inoculated into guinea pigs, the bacteriological diagnosis is made by direct immunofluorescence.

Such etiological data for Vietnam is scarce and clinical doctors lack accurate information on which to base their diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia. This study identifies the prevalence and risk factors of severe community acquired pneumonia due to these atypical pathogens (severe-ApCAP) in children aged 1-15 years with CAP in a pediatric hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: 722 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited for detecting those atypical pathogens, using multiplex PCR and ELISA. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected. Multivariate logistic-regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of potential risk factors with severe-ApCAP. RESULTS: Among 215 atypical pathogen-positive CAP cases, 45.12% (97/215) were severe-ApCAP. Among the severe-ApCAP group, 55.67% (54/97) cases were caused by pure atypical pathogens and 44.33% (43/97) resulted from a co-infection with typical respiratory pathogens. M. pneumoniae was the most common, with 86.6% cases (84/97) in the severe-ApCAP group, whereas C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila were less frequent (6.19% and 7.22%, respectively). The highest rate of severe-ApCAP was in children younger than two years (65.98%). The differences related to age are statistically significant (P = 0.008).The factors significantly associated with severe-ApCAP were age (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.93, P = 0.001), co-infection with typical bacteria (OR = 4.86, 95% CI = 2.17-10.9, P &lt; 0.0001), co-infection with respiratory viruses (OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 1.46-13.0, P = 0.008), respiratory/cardiac system malformation (OR = 14.8, 95% CI = 1.12-196, P = 0.041) and neonatal pneumonia (OR = 11.1, 95% CI = 1.06-116, P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Severe-ApCAP presented at a significant rate in Vietnamese children. More than 50% of severe-ApCAP cases were associated with pure atypical pathogen infection. M. pneumoniae appeared most frequently. The highest rate of severe-ApCAP was in children younger than two years. Younger age and co-infection with typical bacteria or viruses were the most significant risk factors, while respiratory/cardiac system malformation and neonatal pneumonia were additional potential risk factors, associated with severe-ApCAP in Vietnamese children."

This is to ensure that the most resistant pathogen subpopulation is appropriately targeted to prevent emergence of resistance. Accordingly, we determined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of moxifloxacin at 400 mg/day in 18 patients treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model to assess the potential efficacy of moxifloxacin and to simulate the maximal MICs for which recommended pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) estimates are obtained. Moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were determined the day after therapy initiation using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak drug concentrations (Cmax) and area under the free drug concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fAUC0-24) values predicted for each patient were evaluated against epidemiological cutoff MIC values for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella pneumophila. PK-PD targets adopted were a Cmax/MIC of &gt;=12.2 for all pathogens, an fAUC0-24/MIC of &gt;34 for S. pneumoniae, and an fAUC0-24/MIC of &gt;75 for H. influenzae and L. pneumophila. Individual predicted estimates for Cmax/MIC and fAUC0-24/MIC as well as simulated maximal MICs resulting in target attainment for oral and intravenous administration of the drug were suitable for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae but not for L. pneumophila. These results indicate that caution must be taken when moxifloxacin is used as monotherapy to treat community-acquired pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila. In conclusion, this report reveals key information relevant to the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia while highlighting the robust and flexible nature of this population pharmacokinetic model to predict therapeutic success.

Using the Pneumoslide IgM test, the presented study explored the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia and investigated further whether there was an association between age or season and aetiological organisms. METHODS: Serum samples, taken between August 2011 and August 2013, from patients with CAP were tested with the Pneumoslide IgM kit. The Pneumoslide IgM technology can simultaneously diagnose 9 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Coxiella burnetii (COX), Chlamydophila pneumonia (CP), Adenovirus (ADV), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A (INFA), Influenza B (INFB), Parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs). The data was analyzed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS, version 11.0). RESULTS: Of a total of 1204 serum samples tested, 624 samples were positive. M. pneumoniae was the dominant pathogen, with INFB, PIVs, and RSV ranking second to fourth, respectively. The positive percentages of MP, INFB, PIVs and RSV were found to be associated with age, especially MP, INFB and PIVs. The positive percentages of MP, PIVs and RSV were also found to be associated with season. The positive percentage of MP in autumn was the highest. The positive percentages of LP1 in August and September, ADV in June and INFB in March were relatively higher than that in other months. CONCLUSIONS: The results show there were 4 main viral and atypical bacterial pathogens causing CAP in our study. Some pathogens were found to be associated with age and season. M. pneumoniae was the most predominant pathogen among these 9 pathogens. It is necessary to take preventative measures in order to prevent the spread of these pathogens in susceptible age groups during peak season."

Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp. D5382 are likely the first reports of human infection with these organisms. "

Early diagnosis of the etiologic agent is important in order to choose the correct antibiotic treatment. In this study we evaluated the first commercial combined test for the agents of pneumococcal pneumonia and Legionnaires' disease based on urinary antigen detection, the ImmuView  Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila Urinary Antigen Test. In this evaluation, the new test had a significantly higher sensitivity than the BinaxNOW  lateral flow tests and the Binax  EIA test. This identifies the ImmuView  S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila Urinary Antigen Test as a fast and sensitive point of care test for identification of the infectious agent in a major group of patients with pneumonia.

This study added nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured. Pathogens were identified in 78% of the patients. For detection of viruses, patients were randomized to either a 5-virus laboratory-generated PCR bundle or the 17-virus FilmArray PCR platform. The FilmArray PCR platform detected more viruses than the laboratory-generated bundle and did so in less than 2 hours. There were fewer days of antibiotic therapy, P = 0.003, in CAP patients with viral infections and a low serum PCT levels."

METHODS: This was a matched case-control study enrolling 144 patients with non-pneumococcal severe pneumonia: 72 patients from the 2000-2002 database (CAPUCI I group) were paired with 72 from the 2008-2014 period (CAPUCI II group), matched by the following variables: microorganism, shock at admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, immunocompromise, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and age over 65 years. RESULTS: The most frequent microorganism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22.1%) followed by Legionella pneumophila and Haemophilus influenzae (each 20.7%); prevalence of shock was 59.7%, while 73.6% of patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Intensive care unit mortality was significantly lower in the CAPUCI II group (34.7% versus 16.7%; odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95; p = 0.02). Appropriate therapy according to microorganism was 91.5% in CAPUCI I and 92.7% in CAPUCI II, while combined therapy and early antibiotic treatment were significantly higher in CAPUCI II (76.4 versus 90.3% and 37.5 versus 63.9%; p &lt; 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, combined antibiotic therapy (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.74) and early antibiotic treatment (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.22) were independently associated with decreased intensive care unit mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In non-pneumococcal severe community-acquired pneumonia , early antibiotic administration and use of combined antibiotic therapy were both associated with increased intensive care unit survival during the study period."

OBJECTIVE: Determine predictors of mortality or ICU admission. METHODS: Retrospective follow-up of patients diagnosed with Legionella pneumophila pneumonia in Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruna. Period 2000-2013 (n=240). Analysis of multivariate logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Mean age was 57.2+-15.4 years old, 88.3% were male. Average score of comorbidity (Charlson score) was 2.3+-2.3. There was a clear seasonal variation. Predominant symptoms were fever (92.5%), dry cough (38.1%) and dyspnea (33.9%). Creatinine clearance was lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 29.7% and sodium&lt;135 mEq/l in 58.3%. Admission to ICU rate was 16.3% and 10.8% needs mechanical ventilation. Inhospital mortality rate was 4.6%, rising to 23.1% in patients admitted to ICU. Variables associated to predict ICU admission were age (OR=0.96), liver disease (OR=7.13), dyspnea (OR=4.33), delirium (OR=5.86) and high levels of lactatedehydrogenase (OR=1.002).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine clinical and radiographic characteristics of pulmonary infection due to Legionella in persons undergoing treatment for cancer and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. METHODS: Retrospective review of Legionella cases at MSKCC over a fifteen-year study period from January 1999 and December 2013. Cases were identified by review of microbiology records. RESULTS: During the study period, 40 cases of Legionella infection were identified; nine among these were due to non-pneumophila species. Most cases occurred during the summer. The majority [8/9, (89%)] of patients with non-pneumophila infection had underlying hematologic malignancy, compared to 18/31 (58%) with Legionella pneumophila infections. Radiographic findings were varied-nodular infiltrates mimicking invasive fungal infection were seen only among patients with hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients and were frequently associated with non-pneumophila infections (50% vs 16%; P = 0.0594). All cases of nodular Legionella pneumonia were found incidentally or had an indolent clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Legionella should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodular lung lesions in immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematologic malignancy and SCT recipients. Most cases of nodular disease due to Legionella are associated with non-pneumophila infections."

We sought to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) method to diagnosis these bacterial infections in CAP patients and to compare the diagnostic yields obtained from mPCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), and induced sputum (IS) with those obtained with specific PCR commercial kits, paired serology, and urinary antigen. RESULTS: A total of 225 persons were included. Of these, 10 patients showed serological evidence of L. pneumophila infection, 30 of M. pneumoniae, and 18 of C. pneumoniae; 20 individuals showed no CAP. The sensitivities were mPCR-NPS = 23.1%, mPCR-IS = 57.1%, Seeplex -IS = 52.4%, and Speed-oligo -NPA/NPS = 11.1%, and the specificities were mPCR-NPS = 97.1%, mPCR-IS = 77.8%, Seeplex -IS = 92.6%, and Speed-oligo -NPA/NPS = 96.1%. The concordance between tests was poor (kappa &lt;0.4), except for the concordance between mPCR and the commercial kit in IS (0.67). In individuals with no evidence of CAP, positive reactions were observed in paired serology and in all PCRs. CONCLUSIONS: All PCRs had good specificity but low sensitivity in nasopharyngeal samples.

This article will discuss the problems in the serological diagnosis of atypical pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae which are the agents most commonly associated with atypical pneumonia. Specifically, seeking the possibility of non-specific response, we evaluated the prevalence of antibodies to M. pneumoniae in serum samples obtained from patients suspected in clinical investigation for legionellosis. METHODS: The total numbers of 261 serum obtained from patients suspected in clinical investigation for legionellosis, were tested by in-house ELISA with M. pneumoniae sonicated antigen. Some of the positive sera were also re-tested by western-blot with high specific recombinant M. pneumoniae P1 protein. RESULTS: The diagnostic significant level of IgA antibodies to M. pneumoniae were diagnosed by ELISA in 71 (27,2%) of tested serum samples. Some of the IgA-positive sera have also high level of IgG and IgM antibodies to M pneumoniae (respectively 4,2% and 6,5%). Most from the 18 selected positive results obtained by ELISA were also confirmed by western-blot. It was characteristic that IgA antibodies to M pneumoniae were detected more than three times often in serum samples with positive serological tests for Legionnaires' disease than in samples with negative results for L. pneumophila. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the possibility of non-specific reactions in serological diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. However, according to the data of the literature, co-infections of L. pneumophila and M pneumoniae can not be excluded."

Intracellular bacteria are common causes of CAP. However, there is considerable variation in the reported incidence between countries and change over time. The intracellular pathogens that are well established as causes of pneumonia are Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Coxiella burnetii. Since it is known that antibiotic treatment for severe CAP is empiric and includes coverage of typical and atypical pathogens, microbiological diagnosis bears an important relationship to prognosis of pneumonia. Factors such as adequacy of initial antibiotic or early de-escalation of therapy are important variables associated with outcomes, especially in severe cases. Intracellular pathogens sometimes appear to cause more severe disease with respiratory failure and multisystem dysfunction associated with fatal outcomes. The clinical relevance of intracellular pathogens in severe CAP has not been specifically investigated. We review the prevalence, general characteristics, and outcomes of severe CAP cases caused by intracellular pathogens. "

Targeted antibiotic therapy (TAT) for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with positive urinary antigen test (UAT) has been associated with a favorable impact on outcome. We aimed to determine the factors associated with TAT prescription. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study including all patients presenting with CAP and positive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila from January 2010 to December 2013. Patients presenting with aspiration pneumonia, coinfection, and neutropenia were excluded. CAP severity was assessed using the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). TAT was defined as the administration of amoxicillin for pneumococcal infection and either macrolides or fluoroquinolones (inactive against S. pneumoniae) for Legionella infection. RESULTS: A total of 861 patients were included, including 687 pneumococcal infections and 174 legionellosis from eight facilities and 37 medical departments. TAT was prescribed to 273 patients (32%). Four factors were found independently associated with a lower rate of TAT: a PSI score&gt;=4 (OR 0.37), Hospital A (OR 0.41), hospitalization in the intensive care unit (OR 0.44), and cardiac comorbidities (OR 0.60). Four other factors were associated with a high rate of TAT: positive blood culture for S. pneumoniae (OR 2.32), Hospitals B (OR 2.34), E (OR 2.68), and H (OR 9.32).

METHODS: A prospective multicentre study was performed with 4304 patients. We compared microbiological results, bacterial aetiology, smoking, alcohol abuse and comorbidities in three age groups: young adults (&lt;45 years), adults (45-64 years) and seniors (&gt;65 years). RESULTS: Bacterial aetiology was identified in 1522 (35.4%) patients. In seniors, liver disease was independently associated with Gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae), COPD with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR = 2.69 (1.46-4.97)) and Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 2.8 (1.24-6.3)) and neurological diseases with S. aureus. In adults, diabetes mellitus (DM) was a risk factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus, and COPD for H. influenzae (OR = 3.39 (1.06-10.83)). In young adults, DM was associated with S. aureus. Smoking was a risk factor for Legionella pneumophila regardless of age. Alcohol intake was associated with mixed aetiology and Coxiella burnetii in seniors, and with S. pneumoniae in young adults. CONCLUSION: It should be considered that the bacterial aetiology may differ according to the patient's age, comorbidities, smoking and alcohol abuse.

Quick diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation determine favorable outcome. Empirical antibiotic treatment allows to achieve treatment success in most patients. Treatment recommendations are based on big epidemiological trials. Nevertheless, it is sometimes necessary to know the definite etiologic factor of pneumonia. In these cases microbiological diagnostics is useful, i.e. sputum microscopy and culture, blood culture, bronchial lavage culture, bacterial antigen tests in urine, molecular tests. Serological tests do not help much in everyday clinical practice. The most common microorganisms causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila), Haemophilus influenzae, influenza virus. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely are etiologic factors of CAP. First line antibiotics in pneumonia treatment are beta - lactams. In case of allergy or intolerance of beta - lactams, new fluorochinolones should be used. Macrolides are useful if the atypical etiology is suspected. Duration of treatment in most cases should not exceed 7 days, sometimes it may be even shorter. "

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of Legionella in central Texas and to determine the cost effectiveness of Legionella urinary antigen testing. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with pneumonia between January 2001 and December 2013. Patients were identified by Binax Legionella urinary antigen and International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes. Demographic characteristics and clinical history of the confirmed Legionella pneumonia cases were obtained by chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient characteristics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over 12 years, 5,807 patients with 11,377 admissions for pneumonia were tested for Legionella urinary antigen. A positive Legionella urinary antigen was found in 17 patients. Cumulative incidence during the study period was 0.23%. Among the Legionella-positive patients, intensive care unit admission and median length of stay were 58.8% and 8.5 days, respectively. Most patients (64.7%) met American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia. All patients empirically received either a macrolide or fluoroquinolone covering Legionella. There were two in-hospital and three total 90-day deaths in those with a positive urinary antigen. The estimated cost of screening this population with Legionella urinary antigen was $214,438 over 13 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the low incidence of Legionella pneumonia in central Texas. Use of guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment provides coverage for Legionella. We speculate that testing in a low-prevalence area would not influence outcomes or be cost effective."

The most common pathogens are Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The epidemiology and pathophysiology of these three pathogens have been studied since their discovery, and are reviewed herein to provide better insight when evaluating these patients, which hopefully translates into improved care. The incidence of atypical pathogens has been shown to be approximately 22% worldwide, but this probably varies with location. The history and physical exam of a patient with atypical pneumonia reveals how patients share many signs and symptoms with their counterpart patients who have typical pneumonias; therefore, the diagnosis primarily depends on laboratory identification, which is evolving and improving. What started out as simple, but difficult to yield cultures, has progressed to modern molecular-based testing assays. Treatment is missed if an empiric regimen includes only monotherapy with a beta-lactam antimicrobial; so, many country guidelines, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia, recommend using a regimen containing either a macrolide or a fluorinated quinolone. Once an atypical pathogen has been identified, evidence trends toward favoring a quinolone, but more data are needed to confirm. The concept of using combination therapy in severe patients is also explored."

We aimed to evaluate clinical features and outcomes of patients with Legionnaires' disease at a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan. METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2013, a retrospective study of adult cases of Legionnaires' disease was conducted in a 1200-bed tertiary hospital. Their medical records were reviewed for further evaluation and analysis. RESULTS: A total of 61 cases of Legionnaires' disease were identified during the study period. Their mean age was 61.1 years, with male predominance (43, 70.5%). Among them, 30 (49.2%) had healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), 20 (32.8%) had community-acquired pneumonia, and notably 11 (18.0%) were caregivers. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia tend to have higher Charlson comorbidity scores than those with community-acquired pneumonia (3.6+-2.4 vs. 1.9+-1.9, p=0.008) and caregivers (0.5+-0.5, p&lt;0.001).

SUMMARY: A 57-year-old man with longstanding CD was hospitalized with a four-day history of fever (38.5  C), dyspnea, left pleuritic pain, and weight loss (more than 6 kg) about six weeks after beginning treatment with ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody approved in the United States for two indications (plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis) and currently under investigation as a potential treatment for CD and other inflammatory disorders. During the preceding 25 years, the man had been treated for severe CD with a number of agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab); ultimately, off-label ustekinumab therapy (90 mg subcutaneously weekly) was initiated due to persistent severe CD symptoms. Chest x-ray studies at the time of admission demonstrated left upper lobar consolidation, and a urine antigen test was positive for L. pneumophila. The patient was treated with i.v. levofloxacin and methylprednisolone and discharged after two weeks. Ustekinumab was reintroduced (45 mg subcutaneously every two weeks), and the patient continued to receive the drug for 16 months, with clinical remission of CD symptoms and no further adverse events. A literature search identified two case reports of pneumonia associated with ustekinumab use, but neither case involved L. pneumophila. CONCLUSION: Pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila developed in a patient with CD treated with ustekinumab. Pneumonia symptoms resolved after ustekinumab was discontinued."

Methods: The clinical data of 186 patients with severe CAP admission to RICU was collected and assessed the trend in outcomes of these patients during three time periods: Period I (January 1 2000 to October 31 2006), Period II (November 1 2006 to December 31 2010), and Period III (January 1 2011 to December 31 2015), analyzed the risk factors by Cox Proportional Hazards regression, and compared the pathogens detection. Results: The total mortality was 34.9%(65/186)during 16 years, three periods was 41.4%, 35.3% and 27.7% respectively.After adjustment for other variables, the mortality was significant higher for patients admitted during Period I than that of Period III (HR: 1.900; 95.0%CI 1.053-3.429, P=0.033), and no significant difference for Period I compared with Period II (HR: 1.394; 95.0%CI 0.774-2.514, P=0.269), Period II compared with Period III(HR: 1.379; 95.0%CI 0.800-2.375, P=0.248). Cox regression analysis showed the predicting risk factors for prognosis including BUN&gt;=7.14 mmol/L, acute heart failure, acute renal failure, multilobar infiltrates and septic infectious shock ( P&lt;0.05). Multi-variate Cox regression analysis showed that multilobar infiltrates(HR=3.951, 95.0%CI 2.252-6.929, P=0.001) and septic infectious shock(HR=2.044, 95.0%CI 1.131-3.692, P=0.018) were the independent risk factors for prognosis.104 (55.9%) were detected pathogens in 186 patients.The common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (18 isolated strains), Legionella pneumophila (16 isolated strains), Streptococcus pneumonia (13 isolated strains). There was no significant difference between bacterial isolation except virus detection(P=0.033). Conclusion: There has been an improvement in the prognosis of severe CAP.Multilobar infiltrates and septic infectious shock were the independent risk factors for prognosis.Pathogens had changed in SCAP over time, and the detection rate of virus increased gradually."

The prevalence of atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis among patients with these illnesses in the ambulatory setting has not been previously summarized. We set out to derive prevalence information from the existing literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE for prospective, consecutive-series studies reporting the prevalence of M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, L pneumophila and/or B pertussis in outpatients with cough, acute bronchitis, LRTI, or CAP. Articles were independently reviewed by 2 authors for inclusion and abstraction of data; discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion. A meta-analysis was performed on each pathogen to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates using a random effects model of raw proportions. RESULTS: Fifty studies met our inclusion criteria. While calculated heterogeneity was high, most studies reported prevalence for each pathogen within a fairly narrow range. In patients with CAP, the overall prevalences of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were 10.1% (95% CI, 7.1%-13.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%), respectively. Consistent with previous reports, M pneumoniae prevalence peaked in roughly 6-year intervals. Overall prevalence of L pneumophila was 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%), but the organism was rare in children, with only 1 case in 1,765. In patients with prolonged cough in primary care, the prevalence of B pertussis was 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-19.8%), although it was higher in studies that included only children (17.6%; 95% CI, 3.4%-31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical bacterial pathogens are relatively common causes of lower respiratory diseases, including cough, bronchitis, and CAP. Where surveillance data were available, we found higher prevalences in studies where all patients are tested for these pathogens. It is likely that these conditions are underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in current clinical practice."

AIM: To assess the etiology of CAP in immunocompetent adult hospitalized patients using conventional and molecular diagnostic methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 240 adult patients who were hospitalized for CAP to identify the microbial etiology. Sputum and blood cultures were obtained as well as serology testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of sixteen respiratory viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In 100 patients (41.7%) a single respiratory pathogen was identified. In 17 (7.1%) cases, a mixed bacterial and viral infection was detected and no pathogen was identified in 123 cases (51%). The most commonly identified pathogens identified were: influenza virus (15.4%), parainfluenza virus (10.8%), rhinovirus (5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5%), respiratory syncytial virus (2.9%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2.5%). Infectious agent detection by RT-PCR provided greater sensitivity than conventional techniques. Viral respiratory infections were more prevalent in older patients with comorbidities and high risk patients, according to the Fine index at hospital admission. The clinical severity and outcome were independent of the etiological agents detected. CONCLUSIONS: The use of molecular diagnostic techniques expanded the detection of respiratory viruses in immunocompetent adults hospitalized with CAP."

This post-hoc analysis evaluated the effect of addition of a macrolide to ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone treatment in atypical CAP. METHODS: Two phase 3, double-blind, comparative safety and efficacy studies of ceftaroline fosamil vs. ceftriaxone, FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2, enrolled adults with CAP. Only FOCUS 1 included 24-h adjunctive clarithromycin therapy for all patients on day 1. Day 4 and test-of-cure (TOC) outcomes were compared for adjunctive vs. no adjunctive therapy. RESULTS: Of 1240 enrolled patients, 130 patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens alone were included (FOCUS 1, n = 64; FOCUS 2, n = 66). Among patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or Chlamydophila pneumoniae alone, a higher clinical response rate was observed with clarithromycin plus ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone compared with treatment without additional clarithromycin at day 4 [38/49 (77.6%; FOCUS 1) vs. 24/43 (55.8%; FOCUS 2)], but not at the TOC assessment [42/49 (85.7%; FOCUS 1) vs. 41/43 (95.3%; FOCUS 2)]. In patients infected with Legionella pneumophila alone, a higher clinical response rate with adjunctive clarithromycin therapy was observed at the TOC assessment alone [12/12 (100%; FOCUS 1) vs. 14/19 (73.7%; FOCUS 2)]. The unadjusted odds ratio of a favourable clinical response at day 4 with adjunctive clarithromycin vs. no adjunctive clarithromycin was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.1; P = 0.0299) for all pathogens combined. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that empirical antibiotic therapy against atypical pathogens may improve early clinical response rate. This hypothesis is best evaluated in a prospective trial."

We report a case of severe pneumonia caused by Legionella longbeachae, where a method of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay contributed an important role for the early detection. This case involved an 83-year-old man who developed fever, dyspnea, and productive cough. Since the medication of prescribed ceftriaxone had not been effective, he visited the emergency room of our hospital, where an X-ray revealed a severe pneumonia harboring a consolidation with air bronchogram in his right lower lung. His sputum and urine were subjected to the routine bacterial culture or the urinary antigen test for Legionella, which initially brought negative results. However, a positive result of LAMP assay enabled early diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia. Later, the bacterial cultures of sputum made some progress and 16S rRNA sequencing provided a proof of L. longbeachae. This LAMP assay may bring a benefit for the patients with Legionella pneumonia by enabling early detection of not only specific L. pneumophila serogroup 1, but also of the other Legionella species."

Since serological results suggested that Legionella pneumophila was the infectious agent, she was discharged on levofloxacin. A week later, she was again admitted with fever. CT scan showed opacities with crescentic morphology and a central ground-glass area suggestive of cryptogenic organising pneumonia. Microbiological, serological and autoimmunity tests were negative. She underwent surgical lung biopsy that revealed inflammatory infiltrate, macrophage desquamation, fibroblasts proliferation and fibrin deposition in the alveolar spaces, consistent with AFOP. She started corticotherapy with good response. Disease relapsed after prednisolone discontinuation, 10 months later.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounts for 20-40% of all CAP and L. pneumophila is responsible for 3-15% of cases. The paucity of data from India in this regard prompted us to conduct this prospective multicentric analysis to detect the prevalence of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in our geographical region. A total of 453 patients with symptoms of pneumonia and 90 controls with no history of lower respiratory tract infections were included in the study. A duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 543 bp region of P1 adhesin gene of M. pneumoniae and 375 bp region of macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene of L. pneumophila was standardized for simultaneous detection of these atypical pathogens. Respiratory secretions, blood, and urine samples were collected from each patient and control and were subjected to duplex PCR, culture and serology for M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. Urine samples were subjected for detecting L. pneumophila antigen. Among the 453 patients investigated for M. pneumoniae, 52 (11.4%) were positive for IgM antibodies, 17 were positive by culture, and seven tested positive by PCR (P1 gene). Similarly for L. pneumophila, 50 cases (11%) were serologically positive for IgM antibodies, one was positive by PCR (mip gene) and urine antigen detection. A total of eight samples were positive by duplex PCR for M. pneumoniae P1 gene (N = 7) and L. pneumophila mip gene (N = 1). Of the 90 controls, two samples (2.2%) showed IgM positivity, and 15 (16.7%) showed IgG positivity for M. pneumoniae. For L. pneumophila, three samples (3.3%) tested positive for IgM, and 12 (13.3%) tested positive for IgG antibodies. The study findings indicate the presence of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in our geographical region, and a combination of laboratory approaches including PCR, culture, and serology is required for effective detection of these agents."

Recently, most of the Legionella cases have been diagnosed using the urine antigen test. However, this test can reliably detect only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Here we report a 63-year-old male patient who was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia and treated with chemotherapy and who developed pneumonia on hospital day 8 during the nadir phase. He was later diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia by culture despite a negative urine antigen test. This case suggests that Legionella pneumonia is an important differential diagnosis for pneumonia in inpatients in the early phase of hospitalization and that when Legionella infection is clinically suspected, culture using selective media or molecular tests should be performed even if the urine antigen test is negative."

Results The serum sodium (Na) levels tended to be lower according to the severity [age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, low blood pressure (A-DROP)] score in the L-group. On a multivariate analysis, we found that four factors were independent predictive markers for inclusion in the L-group: relative bradycardia [hazard ratio (HR) 5.177, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-24.993, p=0.041], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels &gt;=292 IU/L (HR 6.804, 95% CI: 1.629-28.416, p=0.009), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &gt;=21 mg/dL (HR 28.073, 95% CI: 5.654-139.462, p&lt;0.001), and Na levels &lt;=137 meq/L (HR 5.828, 95% CI: 1.411-24.065, p=0.015). Furthermore, a total score [ranging from 0 to 4, the sum of the points for each factor (0 or 1)] &gt;=3 points indicated a higher probability of inclusion in the L-group than in the S-group. The diagnostic accuracy of a total score of 3 had a sensitivity of 36.3%, specificity of 100%, and area under the curve of 0.682 (95% CI: 0.558-0.806, p=0.004), and that of a total score of 4 had a sensitivity 27.4%, specificity of 98.2%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.627 (95% CI: 0.501-0.754, p=0.045).

","SPECIES:Legionella pneumophilaID:29678761TITLE:A recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Pneumonia is one of the most common and potentially lethal infectious conditions worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, while Legionella pneumophila is the major cause for local outbreaks of legionellosis. Both pathogens can be difficult to diagnose since signs and symptoms are nonspecific and do not differ from other causes of pneumonia. Therefore, a rapid diagnosis within a clinically relevant time is essential for a fast onset of the proper treatment. Although methods based on polymerase chain reaction significantly improved the identification of pathogens, they are difficult to conduct and need specialized equipment. We describe a rapid and sensitive test using isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification and detection on a disposable test strip. This method does not require any special instrumentation and can be performed in less than 20 min. The analytical sensitivity in the multiplex assay amplifying specific regions of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila simultaneously was 10 CFUs of genomic DNA per reaction. In cross detection studies with closely related strains and other bacterial agents the specificity of the RPA was confirmed. The presented method is applicable for near patient and field testing with a rather simple routine and the possibility for a read out with the naked eye."

This study tries to assess the situation of this infection in this area. METHOD: Retrospective study of all patients with positive Legionella antigenuria treated at the University Hospital Lucus Augusti in Lugo (Spain) from 2001, the year in which this test was introduced in our centre, until 2015. We analysed epidemiological data, risk factors, clinical, radiological and biochemical findings, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: The sampled included 136 patients. When comparing the first five years of the study with the last five, the incidence increased from 10.9 to 64.5 cases/1,000,000; the number of antigenuria requests increased 3.4 times, and compared to other pneumonia aetiologies Legionella increased from 0.9% to 15%. The mean age was 64.1years and 84.6% were males; 74.3% had comorbidities. Males were significantly younger (62.7+-16.6 vs 71.9+-17.3) and consumed more alcohol (26.1% vs 0%) and tobacco (67.8% vs 14.3%). Diagnosis was established within the first 72hours in 88.9% of cases and most received levofloxacin (95.6%). Hospitalisation was needed in 85% of cases, 11.7% in ICU and 4.4% died. CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of antigenuria there was an increase in the incidence of Legionella pneumonia recorded in our health area. Its rate in recent years has been one of the highest in our country. Despite the fact that the patients had advanced age and comorbidities, mortality was low."

The aim of our study was to determine the distribution of the bacterial pathogens causing respiratory symptoms in different age groups over a 10-year period. Between January 2008 and September 2017, 1,861 specimens from 1,664 patients admitted to Dankook University Hospital with respiratory symptoms were examined. We used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect six bacterial pneumonia pathogens: Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We detected bacterial pneumonia pathogens in 1,281 (68.83%) specimens. Of the 1,709 pathogens detected, S. pneumoniae was the most common (48.57%; n = 830) followed by H. influenzae (40.08%; n = 685).

These recommendations were based on expert opinions and have not been rigorously evaluated. METHODS: We used data from a multicenter, prospective, surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the IDSA/ATS UAT indications for identifying patients who test positive. SP and LP UATs were completed on all included patients. Separate analyses were completed for SP and LP, using 2-by-2 contingency tables, comparing the IDSA/ATS indications (UAT recommended vs not recommended) and UAT results (positive vs negative). Additionally, logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of each individual criterion in the IDSA/ATS indications with positive UAT results. RESULTS: Among 1941 patients, UATs were positive for SP in 81 (4.2%) and for LP in 32 (1.6%). IDSA/ATS indications had 61% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 49-71%) and 39% specificity (95% CI 37-41%) for SP, and 63% sensitivity (95% CI 44-79%) and 35% specificity (95% CI 33-37%) for LP. No clinical characteristics were strongly associated with positive SP UATs, while features associated with positive LP UATs were hyponatremia, fever, diarrhea, and recent travel. CONCLUSIONS: Recommended indications for SP and LP urinary antigen testing in the IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines have poor sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with positive tests; future CAP guidelines should consider other strategies for determining which patients should undergo urinary antigen testing."

Distinguishing a true co-infection from cross reactivity is often challenging as the diagnosis is mostly dependent on serological testing. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old male presented with worsening dyspnea, cough with yellow sputum, diarrhea and fever of 2-days duration. Patient had history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate and leflunomide), treated pulmonary tuberculosis and 30-pack-year smoking. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial changes with left lower lobe infiltrate. On day 5, his urine antigen for L pneumophila serogroup 1 was reported positive. The following day his serum M pneumoniae IgM antibody titers were reported elevated at 6647 U/mL. Patient was started on antibiotics and placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with possible Legionella and Mycoplasma co-infection. OUTCOMES: Sputum Mycoplasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum cold agglutinins were obtained on day 6 and later reported negative. He was treated with azithromycin for 10 days with clinical improvement. LESSONS: Serological testing alone is an indirect measure with poor sensitivity and specificity and has its own limitations. Urine antigen detection confirms L pneumophila serogroup 1 infection in a patient with suggestive symptoms. However, diagnosis of M pneumonia should be based on combination of tests including serology and PCR to confirm true co-infection."

We aimed to assess both testing for atypical pathogens and their prevalence in hospitalized patients with CAP worldwide, especially in relation with disease severity. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the GLIMP database, an international, multicentre, point-prevalence study of adult patients admitted for CAP in 222 hospitals across 6 continents in 2015, was performed. The study evaluated frequency of testing for atypical pathogens, including L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and their prevalence. Risk factors for testing and prevalence for atypical pathogens were assessed through univariate analysis. RESULTS: Among 3702 CAP patients 1250 (33.8%) underwent at least one test for atypical pathogens. Testing varies greatly among countries and its frequency was higher in Europe than elsewhere (46.0% vs. 12.7%, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Detection of L. pneumophila urinary antigen was the most common test performed worldwide (32.0%). Patients with severe CAP were less likely to be tested for both atypical pathogens considered together (30.5% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.009) and specifically for legionellosis (28.3% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.003) than the rest of the population. Similarly, L. pneumophila testing was lower in ICU patients. At least one atypical pathogen was isolated in 62 patients (4.7%), including M. pneumoniae (26/251 patients, 10.3%), L. pneumophila (30/1186 patients, 2.5%), and C. pneumoniae (8/228 patients, 3.5%). Patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens were significantly younger, showed less cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic comorbidities in comparison to adult patients hospitalized due to non-atypical pathogen CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for atypical pathogens in patients admitted for CAP in poorly standardized in real life and does not mirror atypical prevalence in different settings. Further evidence on the impact of atypical pathogens, expecially in the low-income countries, is needed to guidelines implementation."

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila remain the major etiological agents and are responsible for a significant proportion of CAP mortality. Among diagnostic tests for CAP, urine antigen detection of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila is widely accepted due to the simplicity of collection and the rapidity of the test results. Areas covered: This comprehensive review outlines the urinary antigen tests available, discusses their sensitivity and specificity, and assesses the usefulness of their results as the basis for targeted therapy. Expert commentary: There have been advances in urine antigen detection tests for patients with CAP. New methodologies show greater sensitivity, detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in a single test, and also detect pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, urine antigen detection tests have shown a high specificity, which means that a positive result practically indicates the causative pathogen of CAP. Therefore, a positive result can lead to a targeted therapy that is likely to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of resistance and adverse events. However, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of urine antigen detection tests with regard to clinical outcomes."

The use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods enables testing for many pathogens simultaneously in a single analysis. Aim: To determine the role of atypical pathogens in children hospitalized with CAP. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted throughout a 2-year period from August 2015 to September 2017. It included 400 Egyptian children hospitalized with clinical diagnosis of CAP at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Sputum samples were collected from lower respiratory tract of all enrolled patients by mucus trap catheter for identification of Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia by using multiplex real-time PCR. Results: Among the 400 CAP patients enrolled in this study, atypical pathogens were detected in 12/400 (3%) patients. Bordetella pertussis was detected in 2% of cases, and it was responsible for CAP in 8/104 (7.69%) infants in the age stratum &lt;= 4 months; compared with pertussis-negative cases, pertussis-positive cases were younger and incompletely vaccinated (P values were 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1% of cases, all were among the age stratum &gt; 4 months &lt;= 59 months in 4/272 (1.47%) children. Conclusion: In early infancy, Bordetella pertussis causes a significant proportion of hospitalized CAP cases; all were &lt;= 4 months old and incompletely vaccinated. This finding could suggest the role of maternal immunization in developing countries."

In a previous study, we developed a simple Legionella Score to distinguish patients with Legionella and non-Legionella pneumonia based on clinical information at diagnosis. In the present study, we validated this Legionella Score for the presumptive diagnosis of Legionella CAP. METHODS: This validation cohort included 109 patients with Legionella CAP and 683 patients with non-Legionella CAP. The Legionella Score includes six parameters by assigning one point for each of the following items: being male, absence of cough, dyspnea, C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt;= 18 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;= 260 U/L, and sodium &lt; 134 mmol/L. RESULTS: When the Legionella CAP and non-Legionella CAP were compared by univariate analysis, most of the evaluated symptoms and laboratory test results differed substantially. The six parameters that were used for the Legionella Score also indicated clear differences between the Legionella and non-Legionella CAP. All Legionella patients had a score of 2 points or higher. The median Legionella Scores were 4 in the Legionella CAP cases and 2 in the non-Legionella CAP cases. A receiver operating characteristics curve showed that the area under the curve was 0.93. The proposed best cutoff, total score &gt;=3, had sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 75%. CONCLUSION: Our Legionella Score was shown to have good diagnostic ability with a positive likelihood of 3.7 and a negative likelihood of 0.10."

Immunodeficiency, chemotherapy or chronic steroids use increase the risk of developing LD. Extrapulmonary manifestations of LD include cardiac complications: myocarditis, pericarditis or endocarditis. A CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 51-year-old female with a history of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted due to a high fever, fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea and cough. Chest X-ray and CT showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations and pleural effusion. LD was diagnosed on positive L. pneumophila urinary antigen test. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with substantially decreased ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS), with a pattern resembling reverse takotsubo syndrome (rTTS). The coronary arteries in non-invasive coronary angiography were normal. During therapy with levofloxacin and intravenous immunoglobulins as well as with carvedilol, ramipril and diuretics, gradual clinical improvement with complete normalization of LV function was observed within 5 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed on day 35 revealed only small intramural foci of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with localization not corresponding to the most decreased regional longitudinal strain in the initial echocardiographic examination. The authors suggest that the mechanism of transient LV dysfunction in the case presented may have been of complex nature, including LD myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (with the prevalence of the latter) which has not so far been reported in the literature."

However, scant data are available on the prevalence of etiological organisms for CAP in adolescent and adult Indian population. Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the contribution of S. pneumoniae in the causation of CAP in Indian patients aged 12 years or above. Methodology: We performed a systematic search of both indexed and non-indexed publications using PubMed, databases of National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR), Annotated Bibliography of Indian Medicine (ABIM), Google Scholar, and hand search including cross-references using key terms 'community acquired pneumonia AND India'. All studies, published between January 1990 and January 2017, that evaluated Indian patients aged above 12 years with a confirmed diagnosis of CAP were eligible for inclusion. Our search retrieved a total of 182 studies, of which only 17 and 12 qualified for inclusion in the systematic review of all etiological organisms, and meta-analysis of S. pneumonia, respectively. Results: A total of 1435 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled proportion of patients with S. pneumoniae infection was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12%-26%; I2 = 94.5% where I2 represents heterogeneity, P &lt; .01). Other major etiological agents are Mycoplasma pneumoniae (15.5% [1.1%-35.5%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.5% [1.6%-24.0%]), and Legionella pneumophila (7.3% [2.5%-23.8%]). Conclusions: Analysis found approximately a one-fifth proportion of adult Indian patients of CAP with S. pneumoniae infection, suggesting it as a leading organism for causing CAP compared with other etiological organisms."

Here, we describe a case of monoarthritis due to Legionella bozemanii, with no history of pneumonia. We provide a literature review of the 9 previously published Legionella arthritis and highlight a dichotomous epidemiology suggesting different physiopathological pathways leading to joint infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year old woman under immunosuppressive treatment by oral and intra-articular corticosteroids, methotrexate, and tocilizumab for an anti-synthetase syndrome was hospitalized for worsening pain and swelling of the left wrist for 3 days. Clinical examination showed left wrist synovitis and no fever. The arthritis occurred a few days after an accidental fall on wet asphalt responsible for a cutaneous wound followed by a corticosteroid intra-articular injection. Due to both the negativity of conventional culture of articular fluid and suspicion of infection, 16S rRNA and specific PCRs were performed leading to the identification of L. bozemanii. Legionella-specific culture of the articular fluid was performed retrospectively and isolated L. bozemanii. The empiric antibiotic therapy was switched for oral levofloxacin and rifampin and the patient recovered after a 12-week treatment. CONCLUSION: We report a case of L. bozemanii monoarthritis in an immunosuppressed woman, following a fall on wet asphalt and intra-articular corticosteroid injection. The review of the literature found that the clinical presentation reveals the mode of infection and the bacterial species. Monoarthritis more likely occurred after inoculation in patients under immunosuppressive therapy and were associated with non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) strains that predominate in the environment. Polyarthritis were more likely secondary legionellosis localizations after blood spread of Lp1, the most frequently found in pneumonia. In both settings, 16S rRNA and Legionella-specific PCR were key factors for the diagnosis."

The environmental investigation did not reveal the presence of legionellae in the hospital patient's rooms. Water samples collected from the home of two patients were also negative for Legionella spp. In the absence of environmental strains potentially involved in the infections, we proceeded to genotype environmental Lp1 strains isolated in the hospital during the routine water sampling along the decade 2009-2019 and recovered after long term storage at -20  C. These ""historical"" strains exhibited high grade of similarity and stability over time, regardless of disinfection systems. The different molecular profile showed among clinical and environmental strains excluded a nosocomial outbreak. The study suggests that the application of molecular typing may be a useful tool to discriminate hospital vs community-acquired cases, mostly for severely immunosuppressed patients in which the symptomatology could be insidious and the incubation period could be prolonged. Moreover, the genotyping allowed us to exclude that the cases were linked each other's."

It is mostly known to cause pneumonia in individuals with known risk factors as immunocompromised status, tobacco use, chronic organ failure or age older than 50 years. Although parapneumonic pleural effusion is frequent in legionellosis, pleural empyema is very uncommon. In this study, we report a case of fatal pleural empyema caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in an 81-year-old man with multiple risk factors. CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old man presented to the emergency with a 3 wk dyspnea, fever and left chest pain. His previous medical conditions were chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney failure, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, without tobacco use. Chest X-ray and comouted tomography-scan confirmed a large left pleural effusion, which puncture showed a citrine exudate with negative standard bacterial cultures. Despite intravenous cefotaxime antibiotherapy, patient's worsening condition after 10 d led to thoracocentesis and evacuation of 2 liters of pus. The patient progressively developed severe hypoxemia and multiorgan failure occurred. The patient was treated by antibiotherapy with cefepime and amikacin and with adequate symptomatic shock treatment, but died of uncontrolled sepsis. The next day, cultures of the surgical pleural liquid samples yielded L. pneumophila serogroup 1, consistent with the diagnosis of pleural legionellosis. CONCLUSION: L. pneumophila should be considered in patients with multiple risk factors and undiagnosed pleural empyema unresponsive to conventional antibiotherapy."

In the summer of 2017, several European countries reported high notification rates for Legionnaires' disease, which was not observed in Norway. We evaluated MSIS to assess if it meets its objectives of detecting cases and trends in incidence of Legionnaires' disease. METHODS: We retrieved MSIS data from 2008 to 2017 and calculated timeliness as days from sampling to notification, and internal completeness for key variables as the proportion of observations with a value. Where possible, we assessed internal validity on the presence of a plausible value. To estimate external completeness and validity we linked MSIS with hospital reimbursement claims in the Norwegian Patient Registry. To assess acceptability and representativeness, we surveyed doctors in 39 hospitals on their units' diagnostic and notification procedures, and their use of MSIS. RESULTS: There were 438 notified cases. Internal completeness and internal validity were high for key variables (>=95%). The median delay from sampling to notification was 4 days. There were 73 patients in MSIS only, 70 in the Norwegian Patient Registry only, and 351 in both registers. The external completeness of MSIS was 83% (95% CI 80-86%). For external validity, the positive predictive value of MSIS was 83% (95% CI 79-86%). Forty-seven respondents from 28 hospitals described testing procedures. These were inconsistent: 29 (62%) reported no systematic application of criteria for requesting legionella testing. Eighteen (38%) reported testing all patients with suspected pneumonia and a travel history. Thirty-one (66%) found the notification criteria clear. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the surveillance in MSIS can detect incidence changes for Legionnaires' disease over time, by place and person, but likely does not detect every case diagnosed in Norway. We recommend wider investigation of diagnostic procedures in order to improve representativeness and awareness of MSIS notification criteria among clinicians in order to improve acceptability of the surveillance. We also recommend a more comprehensive assessment of whether patients only registered in the Norwegian Patient Registry were true Legionnaires' disease cases."

In this study, we assessed the frequency of Legionnaires' disease among pneumonia cases treated at a large community hospital over a summer season. We invited all admitted patients diagnosed with pneumonia, able to provide a urine sample for an antigen test, presenting from May to October 2018, to enroll in our study; 35 patients were tested for the presence of Legionella.

We present the case of a 60-year-old man diagnosed with eosinophilic fasciitis with extensive cutaneous involvement and severe functional repercussion, which appeared weeks after suffering from pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila. The patient did not experience any clinical response with high-dose corticosteroids, subcutaneous methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Consequently, tocilizumab was initiated at 8 mg/Kg monthly achieving clinical response measured by a control MRI at the fifth dose. Response in terms of cutaneous thickness has been slower however favourable, therefore, more months of follow-up are necessary to assess the complete remission at skin level. EF treatment still constitutes a challenge, and experience with tocilizumab in the management of the disease is very limited.

Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup."

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests.

We aimed to identify cumulative incidence, demographic distribution, and undetected disease outbreaks of Legionella pneumonia via positive LUAT in a single eastern Wisconsin health system, with a focus on urban Milwaukee County. Methods: A multilevel descriptive ecologic study was conducted utilizing electronic medical record data from a large integrated health care system of patients who underwent LUAT from 2013 to 2017. A random sample inclusive of all positive tests was reviewed to investigate geodemographic differences among patients testing positive versus negative. Statistical comparisons used chi-squared or 2-sample t-tests; stepwise regression followed by binary logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis. Positive cases identified by LUAT were mapped to locate hotspots; positive cases versus total tests performed also were mapped by zip code. Results: Of all LUAT performed (n=21,599), 0.68% were positive. Among those in the random sample (n=11,652), positive cases by LUAT were more prevalent in the June-November time period (86.2%) and younger patients (59.4 vs 67.7 years) and were disproportionately male (70.3% vs 29.7%) (P<0.0001 for each). Cumulative incidence was higher among nonwhite race/ethnicity (1.91% vs 1.01%, P<0.0001) but did not remain significant on multivariable analysis. Overall, 5507 tests were performed in Milwaukee County zip codes, yielding 82 positive cases by LUAT (60.7% of all positive cases in the random sample). A potential small 2016 outbreak was identified. Conclusions: Cumulative incidence of a positive LUAT was less than 1%. LUAT testing, if done in real time by cooperative health systems, may complement public health detection of Legionella pneumonia outbreaks."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

","SPECIES:Legionella pneumophilaID:32517424TITLE:Current perspectives on atypical pneumonia in children.ABSTRACT:The major pathogens that cause atypical pneumonia are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae is common in children and presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting disease. CAP due to L. pneumophila is very rare in children and progresses rapidly, with fatal outcomes if not treated early. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila have no cell walls; therefore, they do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics. Accordingly, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are the treatments of choice for atypical pneumonia. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics used in children because of their low minimum inhibitory concentrations and high safety. The incidence of pneumonia caused by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae that harbors point mutations has been increasing since 2000, particularly in Korea, Japan, and China. The marked increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MRMP) is partly attributed to the excessive use of macrolides. MRMP does not always lead to clinical nonresponsiveness to macrolides. Furthermore, severe complicated MRMP responds to corticosteroids without requiring a change in antibiotic. This implies that the hyper-inflammatory status of the host can induce clinically refractory pneumonia regardless of mutation. Empirical macrolide therapy in children with mild to moderate CAP, particularly during periods without M. pneumoniae epidemics, may not provide additional benefits over beta-lactam monotherapy and can increase the risk of MRMP."

The mean age of MP-infected patients was higher than that of the controls (P < .05). The positive rates for influenza B (INFB), Legionella pneumophila (LP1), Coxiella burnetii (COX), influenza A (INFA), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), and adenovirus (ADV) were 5.56%, 3.07%, 2.63%, 2.34%, 1.90%, 1.61, 0.88%, and 0.29%, respectively. There were 4.37% of patients with CAP having multiple infections. The main symptoms observed in the 685 CAP patients were cough and sputum production, in 78.4% and 67.4%. Fever was followed by 54% of CAP patients. Dyspnea (39.1%), anorexia (36.8%), increased thirst (26.7%), chills (18.7), headache (14.6%), and nausea (13.1%) were also frequently observed in the CAP patients. CONCLUSIONS: MP infection was the most common in adult CAP patients in Guangzhou City with the highest positive rate in the 18-24 age groups."

Methods: From October 2011 to October 2019, 34 patients were diagnosed with SCAP caused by Legionella pneumophila with acute respiratory failure.There were 25 males and 9 females, aged from 17 to 82 years, with a median age of 61 (48, 69) years. According to the prognosis, the patients were divided into a survival group and a death group for comparative analysis.The survival group included 24 patients, 17 males and 7 females, with a median age of 65 (55, 70) years. There were 10 cases in the death group, 8 males and 2 females, with a median age of 53 (50, 58) years. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for risk factors of ICU mortality. Results: The median time of admission to ICU was 7 (5, 11) days, the median time of stay in RICU was 12 (7, 22) days, and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 134 (91, 216) mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). Ten patients died during ICU hospitalization, with a mortality of 29%. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) of death group was 9 (7, 12), which was significantly higher than that of the survival group [4 (3, 8)], P=0.018. The time from onset of pneumonia symptoms to initiation of targeted treatment of the death group was 10 (7, 14) d, which was significantly longer than that of the survival group of [4 (3, 7) d], P=0.019. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that SOFA score (OR=1.461, 95%CI 1.041-2.051, P=0.028) and the time from onset of pneumonia symptoms to initiation of targeted treatment (OR=1.293, 95%CI 1.029-1.625, P=0.027) were independent risk factors for hospital mortality. Conclusions: The ICU mortality of severe legionella pneumonia was high. Critical organ dysfunctions and delayed initial targeted treatment were related with the increase of ICU mortality."

","SPECIES:Legionella pneumophilaID:32727982TITLE:Legionellosis in Japan: A Self-inflicted Wound?ABSTRACT:Legionellosis is a serious bacterial infection characterized by atypical pneumonia primarily due to infection with L. pneumophila, and bathing can be a potential cause of this infection. Legionellosis was first identified in 1977, and it is caused by Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Legionella. Legionellosis remains an important public health threat, particularly in Japan, where the population is rapidly aging, thereby becoming more at risk for developing severe disease and accompanying life-threatening pneumonia. The bacteria are most commonly transmitted via the inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced and broadcast via water sprays, jets or mists. Infection can also occur via the aspiration of contaminated water or ice, or through inhalation of contaminated dust. Because the signs and symptoms of LD, as well as radiographic imaging are similar to pneumonia caused by other pathogens, a specific diagnostic test is required, such as a urine antigen detection test. Six clinical and laboratory parameters, a high body temperature, a non-productive cough, low serum sodium and platelet counts, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and c-reactive protein concentrations can be used to reliably predict the likelihood of LD. The first choices for chemotherapy are fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotic drugs. The main goals of LD prevention measures are 1) the prevention of microbial growth and biofilm formation, 2) the removal of all biofilm formed on equipment and in facilities, 3) minimizing aerosol splash and spread, and 4) minimizing bacterial contamination from external sources. It is apparent that, in Japan, where hot spring (onsen) bathing is common among aged people, strict regulations need to be in place - and enforced - to ensure that all Japanese onsens and spas provide a safe environment and undertake regular, effective infection control practices."

These agents are mostly associated with infection in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these pathogens among patients with CAP attending outpatient clinics in Tehran. A cross-sectional study was carried out of 150 patients attending to educational hospitals in Tehran with CAP. M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected by PCR assay, targeting the P1 adhesion gene, macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively from throat swabs obtained from each patient. A total of 86 (57.3%) of 150 patients were women; median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 35-65 years). M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. were detected in 37 (24.7%), 25 (16.7%) and 11 (7.3%) patients respectively; of these, 66 patients (44%) were infected at least by one of these three pathogens. The frequency of L. pneumophila was significantly higher among patients over 60 years old (p 0.03). Coinfection was detected in seven patients (4.7%); six were infected by M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and only one was infected by L. pneumophila and Chlamydia spp. M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent agent of atypical CAP, and L. pneumophila was more likely to infect elderly rather than younger people. Further studies on the prevalence of CAP and its aetiologic agents are needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CAP patients."

METHODS: Between February 2013 and February 2015, 107 patients were analyzed. Sixty-nine comprised the inpatient and 38 comprised the outpatient treatment group. RESULTS: When non-specific culture results were taken into consideration only, a causative organism could be detected in 46.7% of the patients. The detection rate increased to 85.1% with the additional use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test and culture methods. More than one causative agent was responsible for COPD exacerbation in 53.3% of patients: two agents in 37.3%, three agents in 15%, and four agents in 0.9%. H.influenzae was detected in 63 (58.9%) patients, S.pneumoniae in 57 (53.2%), P.aeruginosa in 15 (14.0%) and L.pneumophila in 11 (10%). L.pneumophila was the more commonly isolated agent in the inpatient group (p=0.002).Patients receiving continuous oxygen therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have an exacerbation associated with P.aeruginosa (p=0.008 and p=0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: The additional use of DFA for Legionella and multiplex PCR in combination with non-specific microbiological culturing methods greatly improves the ability to identify infectious agents in acute exacerbations of COPD. There should be a high index of suspicion for P.aeruginosa as a causative organism, particularly in subjects receiving continuous oxygen therapy and/or using NIV and L.pneumophilia should certainly be taken into consideration in severe COPD exacerbations."

In Switzerland, the number of LD cases, captured by the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases, has more than doubled since 2008. This study aims to investigate this increase, contextualizing disease surveillance data with denominator data, which is not routinely available, i.e., the number of tests performed for Legionella spp. We collected the testing data for Legionella spp. of 14 Swiss diagnostic laboratories and calculated the positivity, defined as the proportion of the number of positive tests to the number of tests performed. The number of positive tests increased proportionally to the number of tests performed; hence, the positivity remained stable. However, the cause of the increase in test volume is unclear and has a large impact on the interpretation of the positivity curve. Further, the test outcome was found to be dependent on regional determinants, and the diagnostic method applied. The lack of understanding if and at which stage LD is considered in current case management of pneumonia patients limits the interpretation of observed heterogeneities in incidence or underestimation of LD in Switzerland. The absence of (or non-adherence to) existing guidelines and the heterogeneity in diagnostic testing hampers the comparison of data in the Swiss public health context. Therefore, diagnostic procedures should be harmonised across Switzerland and adherence to national LD management guidelines supported."

PATIENT CONCERNS: This case study reports on the fatal incident of a patient, initially diagnosed with pneumonia, and subsequently diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by a new sequence type (ST) of Legionella. DIAGNOSIS: It is speculated that the patient acquired Legionnaires' disease from a contaminated water source. Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed using the Legionella urinary antigen assay and bacterial cultures of respiratory secretions; Legionella pneumophilia Type 1 was also identified through serological testing. Sequence-based typing of the cultured bacterium revealed it to be a previously unidentified species, and it was named ST2345 new-type. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to the treatment of Legionnaires' disease, blood samples taken on the second day of admission showed a co-infection of Candida tropicalis, which was treated with anti-fungal treatment. The patient improved after a week, however, on the seventh day of administration lower respiratory secretions showed the growth of Klebsiella pneumonia, indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia. OUTCOMES: Despite active treatment, the patient passed away due to multiple organ failure. As this was a fatal case, further research is needed to determine whether the critical condition of this case was related to the virulence of the novel Legionella strain. CONCLUSION: A key finding of this study is that treatment for suspected Legionnaires' disease must be administered rapidly, as infection with Legionella may give rise to secondary pathogenic infections."

Bacterial co-infections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in respiratory viral infections; however, microbiological and antibiotic data related to COVID-19 are sparse. Adequate use of antibiotics in line with antibiotic stewardship (ABS) principles is warranted during the pandemic. We performed a retrospective study of clinical and microbiological characteristics of 140 COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 to a German University hospital, with a focus on bacterial co-infections and antimicrobial therapy. The final date of follow-up was 6 May 2020. Clinical data of 140 COVID-19 patients were recorded: The median age was 63.5 (range 17-99) years; 64% were males. According to the implemented local ABS guidelines, the most commonly used antibiotic regimen was ampicillin/sulbactam (41.5%) with a median duration of 6 (range 1-13) days. Urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus peumoniae were negative in all cases. In critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (n = 50), co-infections with Enterobacterales (34.0%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (18.0%) were detected. Blood cultures collected at admission showed a diagnostic yield of 4.2%. Bacterial and fungal co-infections are rare in COVID-19 patients and are mainly prevalent in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of antimicrobial therapy on therapeutic outcome in COVID-19 patients to prevent antimicrobial overuse. ABS guidelines could help in optimising the management of COVID-19. Investigation of microbial patterns of infectious complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients is also required."

METHODS: This study was conducted in 16 hospitals in Japan from April 2016 to December 2018. Three urinary antigen test kits, including the novel kit (LAC-116), Binax NOWLegionella (Binax), and Q-line Kyokutou Legionella (Q-line), were used. In addition, culture and nucleic acid detection tests of sputum and serum antibody tests were performed where possible.

Even though LD has been reported from many parts of the world, only sporadic cases have been reported in India. During February 2015-January 2020, we enrolled 597 patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia and tested respiratory secretions for Legionella spp. by using real-time PCR, and culture. A commercial urinary antigen test (UAT) was also used to detect the Legionella pneumophila (Lp) serogroup 1 antigen in urine. An LD case was defined as a patient with pneumonia and positive results for Legionella spp. infections determined by real-time PCR (from any respiratory specimen) or culture or UAT. Demographic data, risk factors, clinical, radiological, and outcome data of Lp-positive and Lp-negative patients were compared using logistic regression. Over the study period, 14 (2.3%) patients were positive for Legionella spp. infections by real-time PCR and UAT; eight (57%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and four (28.6%) in-hospital deaths occurred. Bivariate analysis showed that renal disease, neurological conditions, confusion, leukocytosis, and requirement of oxygen support were more common in the Lp-positive group than in the Lp-negative group. However, multivariate analysis failed to confirm most of these differences; renal disease was the only independent variable remaining significant. All test methods have intrinsic limitations in identifying Legionella; therefore, more than one testing method should be used. Application of molecular assays including real-time PCR has great value because of its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid diagnostic potency. Increased awareness and improved diagnostic testing could facilitate early detection of cases, pathogen-directed therapy, and improved outcomes for patients."

Testing, empiric treatment, and outcomes for patients with Legionella have not been well described. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is testing for Legionella pneumophila appropriate and could it impact treatment? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a large retrospective cohort analysis using 2010-2015 data from the Premier Healthcare Database. We included adults with a principal diagnosis code for pneumonia (or a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure or sepsis with secondary diagnosis of pneumonia) if they also received treatment for pneumonia by hospital day 1. We categorized Legionella-tested patients by test result, identified patient characteristics associated with testing and test result, and examined seasonal and regional patterns of Legionella pneumonia (LP) diagnoses. Empiric therapy for LP was defined as a macrolide, quinolone, or doxycycline, administered on each of the first 2 hospital days. RESULTS: Of 166,689 eligible patients, 43,070 (26%) were tested for Legionella, and 642 (1.5%) tested positive. While only 36% of tests were ordered from June-October, 70% of positive tests occurred during this time. Only 30% of patients with hyponatremia and 32% with diarrhea and 27% in the ICU were tested. Of positive patients, 495/642 (77%) had received empiric Legionella therapy. LP patients did not have more severe presentation. They had more late decompensation, but similar mortality to patients without LP. INTERPRETATION: Legionella is an uncommon cause of CAP, occurring primarily from late spring through early autumn. Testing is uncommon, even among patients with risk factors, and many positive patients failed to receive empiric coverage for LP."

Despite established guidelines for empirical therapy, several factors may influence etiology and, consequently, antibiotic choices. The aims of this study were to analyze the etiology of CAP in adults admitted to a northern Portugal University Hospital and evaluate the yield of the different methods used to reach an etiological diagnosis, as well as analyze of the impact of patient demographic and clinical features on CAP etiology. We retrospectively analyzed 1901 cases of CAP with hospitalization. The diagnostic performance increased significantly when blood and sputum cultures were combined with urinary antigen tests. The most frequent etiological agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae (45.7%), except in August, when it was overtaken by gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Legionella pneumophila infections. Viral infections were almost exclusive to winter and spring. A negative microbiological result was associated with increasing age, non-smoking and lack of both blood/sputum cultures. Younger age was a predictor for S. pneumoniae, Influenza and L. pneumophila infections. Active smoking without any previously known respiratory disease was a risk factor for legionellosis. COPD was associated with Haemophilus influenzae cases, while dementia was typical in GNB and S. aureus patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart disease were negative predictors of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively. P. aeruginosa was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 13.02, 95% CI 2.94-57.7). This study highlights the importance of a comprehensive microbiological diagnostic workup and provides clues to predicting the most probable CAP causative agents, based on a patient's clinical profile.

However, reports of ocular lesions due to Legionnaire's disease are limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient with Legionnaire's disease presenting as bilateral central scotomata due to retinal lesions. The patient consulted due to fever and bilateral central scotomata, as well as other extrapulmonary symptoms. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed bilateral accumulations of fluid under the retina, and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral exudative retinal detachment. Later, Legionnaire's disease was confirmed by pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and positive urinary antigen for Legionella pneumophila. After administration of antibiotics, the bilateral central scotomata and bilateral subretinal fluid accumulations completely resolved, as did the other extrapulmonary symptoms and the pulmonary infiltrates. Thus, the bilateral central scotomata due to exudative retinal detachment were thought to be caused by Legionnaire's disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that Legionnaire's disease can present as bilateral central scotomata.

In patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction, even relatively avirulent pathogens, that is, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, may compromise borderline cardiac/heart function and present clinically as severe CAP. Alternately, patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and impaired humoral immunity/splenic dysfunction may present as severe CAP. With the exception of Legionnaire's disease, influenza, and adenovirus, pathogen virulence is not a key determinant of CAP severity. METHODS: Diagnostically, patients with severe CAP may be approached based on the pattern of infiltrates on chest x-ray together with the severity of hypoxemia (ie, increased A-a gradient: &gt;35). RESULTS: We present the case of an immunocompetent adult who presented with severe CAP during peak influenza season. Direct fluorescent antibody testing of his respiratory secretions was negative for influenza, adenovirus, and other respiratory viruses. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was negative for bacterial and fungal pathogens. The only clues to the cause of his severe CAP was the presence of relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytosis and elevated serum transaminases. After influenza and adenovirus were ruled out, cytomegalovirus (CMV) CAP was considered. The diagnosis of CMV CAP was made serologically by demonstrating highly elevated IgM CMV titers. Because the diagnosis was made during the patient's recovery late in hospitalization, he did not receive CMV antiviral therapy. CONCLUSION: This case should remind clinicians that influenza and adenovirus are diagnostic considerations in patients presenting with severe CAP with diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates accompanied by severe hypoxemia in normal hosts. If influenza and adenovirus are ruled out, then CMV CAP, although rare, should be considered, particularly when viral CAP is accompanied by relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytosis and increased serum transaminases."

","SPECIES:Moraxella catarrhalisID:19929027TITLE:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: role of bacteria and updated guide to antibacterial selection in the older patient.ABSTRACT:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is especially prevalent in the elderly, affecting 25% of those aged&gt;or=75 years. The course of the disease in the elderly is often complicated by co-morbid conditions, and its management is complicated by drug-drug interactions. Exacerbations of COPD increase rates of hospitalization and mortality and decrease quality of life. Exacerbations are marked by an increase from baseline in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence. Approximately 50% of acute exacerbations of symptoms in COPD are caused by non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Stratification of exacerbations based on severity of symptoms and signs, and severity of underlying COPD, is useful in selecting patients likely to benefit from antibacterial therapy. Patients who are hospitalized with exacerbations, those who have all three symptoms (increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence), and those with severe underlying COPD and exacerbations benefit most from antibacterials. Antibacterial susceptibility patterns among the bacterial pathogens are evolving, and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns is useful in antibacterial selection. Penicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and doxycycline should not be used as an initial antibacterial because of resistance patterns. We recommend second-/third-generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin and respiratory fluoroquinolones as initial choices. In patients at risk of colonization by, and infection as a result of, P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or an advanced penicillin/penicillinase combination effective against this species should be used. Drug-drug interactions should be considered in antibacterial choice. The goals of antibacterial therapy for exacerbations of COPD are the prevention of complications such as respiratory failure and death, and the reduction of treatment failures. The role of pathogenic bacteria in progression of stable COPD and the use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable COPD are under investigation. Currently available evidence does not support routine clinical use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable COPD. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria cause a significant proportion of acute exacerbations of COPD. Use of antibacterials, based on current susceptibility patterns, is beneficial in patients with severe COPD experiencing exacerbations and in patients with severe exacerbations."

","SPECIES:Moraxella catarrhalisID:20014950TITLE:Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia: increased microbiological yield with new diagnostic methods.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still not well characterized. During the past few years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been developed for many pathogens causing respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of CAP among adults-especially the occurrence of mixed infections among patients with CAP-by implementing a new diagnostic PCR platform combined with conventional methods. METHODS: Adults admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively during a 12-month period. Microbiological testing methods included culture from blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal secretion samples; sputum samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed by use of PCR; serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detection of pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. RESULTS: A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of the patients (n = 124). For patients with complete sampling, a microbiological agent was identified for 89% of the cases. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (70 patients [38%]) and respiratory virus (53 patients [29%]). Two or more pathogens were present in 43 (35%) of 124 cases with a determined etiology. CONCLUSIONS: By supplementing traditional diagnostic methods with new PCR-based methods, a high microbial yield was achieved. This was especially evident for patients with complete sampling. Mixed infections were frequent (most commonly S. pneumoniae together with a respiratory virus)."

In this study, demographic features, underlying conditions, causative pathogens and factors affecting length of hospital stay and mortality were retrospectively investigated in patients who were diagnosed as CAP and followed-up in our unit between January 2005-December 2007. Among 97 patients 65 (67%) were male, 32 (33%) were female and the mean age was 62.7 (age range: 18-94) years. Patients were grouped according to criteria of Turkish Thoracic Society into four groups; 22 were group 2 (patients with risk factors, without aggrevating factors), 59 were group 3 (patients with aggrevating factors), and 16 were group 4 (patients who have necessity for intensive care) CAP. The patients have also been grouped according to criteria of American Thoracic Society (CURB-65 score = Confusion, Urea &gt; 7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate &gt; or = 30/min, low Blood pressure and being &gt; or = 65 years old), as group I (n = 65), group II (n = 20), and group III (n = 12). During follow-up 11 (11.3%) patients required mechanical ventilation support and 6 (6.2%) patients have died. Causative pathogens were isolated from 14 (23.3%) out of 27 well-qualified sputum samples obtained from 60 patients who could produce sputum (8 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Moraxella catarrhalis). Thirty-seven of cases were treated with levofloxacin, 10 with moxifloxacin, 24 with ceftriaxone +/- clarithromycin, 16 with sulbactam-ampicillin +/- ciprofloxacin, 10 with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and fever declined within 2.5 days in 83 (85.6%) of them. The mean duration of hospital stay was estimated as 11.1 days. In the evaluation of the factors that affect the length of hospital stay, being &gt; or = 65 years old, gender, underlying conditions, central venous catheterisation, presence of nasogastric tube, positive culture result, previous antibiotic treatment, fever continuing for &gt; 3 days despite antibiotic therapy and scoring groups were not determined as risk factors (p &gt; 0.05 for all of these parameters). However, mechanical ventilation was found as a significant risk factor (p &lt; 0.05). In the evaluation of the factors that affect mortality, mechanical ventilation (p &lt; 0.001), staying in intensive care unit (p &lt; 0.001), being group 4 CAP (p &lt; 0.001) and fever continuing for &gt; 3 days despite antibiotic therapy (p = 0.05) were found to be significant risk factors. In conclusion, length of hospital stay, mortality and treatment costs in CAP patients could be reduced by defining the risk factors and starting empirical antibiotic therapy according to the national and international guidelines."

A secondary goal was to describe the clinical features of children with M. catarrhalis pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for (i) case series of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) where one or more diagnostic tests for M. catarrhalis were applied to all cases and (ii) case reports of previously healthy children with proven M. catarrhalis pneumonia. RESULTS: There were nine case series describing a total of 1,500 children with CAP. The number of children tested and yield was as follows: blood cultures 0/402 (0%); sputum cultures 15/157 (10%); nasopharyngeal, or postnasal cultures 129/521 (25%); sputum or nasopharyngeal cultures 0/74 (0%) (one study allowed either); nucleic acid amplification testing 2/100 (2%); serology 30/976 (3%). There were eight case reports of CAP with M. catarrhalis in previously well children. Children were ages 3 weeks to 7 years of age (median 14 months). Six of 8 (75%) children required mechanical ventilation. All survived. CONCLUSION: It is common to detect M. catarrhalis in upper respiratory secretions in children with pneumonia, but bacteremia or seroconversion is rare. There are only eight well-documented case reports CAP due to M. catarrhalis in previously well children, with there being no distinctive features in the eight cases described to date. This organism is likely a rare cause of CAP in previously healthy children."

In China, comprehensive studies of the etiology of CAP in children aged between 2 months and 14 years who are serious enough to require hospitalization are lacking. Previous studies have been limited in child age range, focused on fatal cases, and/or limited in etiologies sought. An understanding of the etiologies is needed for development of best prevention and management practices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively determine during a 12-month period the etiology of CAP in hospitalized children in a center in Northwest China. DESIGN/METHODS: A prospective 12-month study (2004-2005) of CAP cases in children who were 2 months to 14 years of age admitted to the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, China. Testing included admission and 1-month postdischarge serum for viral and bacterial serologic analyses (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, paraflu 1-3, adenovirus; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza B, Mycoplasma, and Moraxella. catarrhalis), blood culture, a nasopharyngeal aspirate for viral antigen testing, and a chest radiograph on admission and 1 month postdischarge. The study was funded by Lanzhou University. The study was performed in compliance with the guidelines of the institutional review board of the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. RESULTS: CAP was the admitting diagnosis for 29% of all admissions during the 12-month study. Of the 884 CAP cases, 821 (93%) were enrolled and completed the study. The age range was 2 months to 14 years; mean age was 2.3 years; 40% were &lt;1 year. The average length of stay was 9.2 days (range, 6-20) but varied by age and etiology. Fourteen percent had received antibiotics before admission and 14% had underlying illnesses; 12% required intensive care unit treatment and 5 died. A microbial etiology for CAP was identified in 547 (67%); viral 535 (43%), bacterial 228 (27%), mixed viral bacterial 107 (13%), mixed viral in 1%, and mixed bacterial in 1%. The etiology varied by age; respiratory syncytial virus was most common in &lt;1 year, S. pneumoniae and Hib 1-3 years, and Mycoplasma 5 years. Three potentially vaccine preventable etiologies accounted for 35% of the cases: influenza 9%, Hib 12%, and S. pneumonia 14%. CONCLUSIONS: CAP is a major cause of childhood admission in China. Given the etiologic findings in this study, potentially 25% to 35% of cases could be prevented if seasonal influenza vaccine and conjugated H. influenza b and conjugated pneumococcal vaccines were introduced into routine practice."

We explored this association in Vietnamese children aged less than 5 years. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study of pediatric LRTIs was conducted in Nha Trang, Vietnam. A total of 550 hospitalized children (274 radiologically confirmed pneumonia [RCP] and 276 other LRTIs) were enrolled and 350 healthy controls were randomly selected from the community. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to measure bacterial loads of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis and to detect 13 respiratory viruses and bacterial serotypes in nasopharyngeal samples of study participants. RESULTS: The median nasopharyngeal bacterial load of SP was substantially higher in children with RCP compared with healthy controls or children with other LRTIs (P &lt; 0.001). SP load was 15-fold higher in pneumonia children with viral coinfection compared with those children without viral coinfection (1.4 x 107/mL vs. 9.1 x 105/mL; P 0.0001). SP load was over 200-fold higher in serotypeable SP compared with nontypeable SP (2.5 x 106/mL vs. 1 x 104/mL; P &lt; 0.0001). These associations were independent of potential confounders in multiple regression models. No clear association was found between nasopharyngeal load of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and viral coinfection in either RCP or other LRTIs groups. CONCLUSIONS: An increased load of SP in the nasopharynx was associated with RCP, viral coinfection, and presence of pneumococcal capsule."

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and pulmonary thin-section CT findings in patients with acute M. catarrhalis pulmonary infection. METHODS: Thin-section CT scans obtained between January 2004 and March 2009 from 292 patients with acute M. catarrhalis pulmonary infection were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical and pulmonary CT findings in the patients were assessed. Patients with concurrent infection including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 72), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 61) or multiple pathogens were excluded from this study. RESULTS: The study group comprised 109 patients (66 male, 43 female; age range 28-102 years; mean age 74.9 years). Among the 109 patients, 34 had community-acquired and 75 had nosocomial infections. Underlying diseases included pulmonary emphysema (n = 74), cardiovascular disease (n = 44) or malignant disease (n = 41). Abnormal findings were seen on CT scans in all patients and included ground-glass opacity (n = 99), bronchial wall thickening (n = 85) and centrilobular nodules (n = 79). These abnormalities were predominantly seen in the peripheral lung parenchyma (n = 99). Pleural effusion was found in eight patients. No patients had mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node enlargement. CONCLUSIONS: M. catarrhalis pulmonary infection was observed in elderly patients, often in combination with pulmonary emphysema. CT manifestations of infection were mainly ground-glass opacity, bronchial wall thickening and centilobular nodules."

This study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of HDAP and to assess whether HDAP should be included in the HCAP category. We retrospectively analyzed 69 HDAP patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on A-DROP (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (10.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). This distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of HCAP reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of MRSA was higher. There were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of MDR pathogens, between the two severity groups. Despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past HCAP reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of MDR pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in MDR positive vs. 8.5% in MDR negative; p = 0.242). Assessment for not only MDR pathogens, but also severity of illness by the A-DROP system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. Our results suggest that HDAP should be included in the HCAP category, while understanding that there are some differences."

Although the majority of patients with CAP are treated as outpatients, the greatest proportion of pneumonia-related mortality and healthcare expenditure occurs among the patients who are hospitalized. There has been considerable interest in determining risk factors and severity criteria assessments to assist with site-of-care decisions. For both inpatients and outpatients, the most common pathogens associated with CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, group A streptococci and Moraxella catarrhalis. Atypical pathogens, Gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and viruses are also recognized aetiological agents of CAP. Despite the availability of antimicrobial therapies, the recent emergence of drug-resistant pneumococcal and staphylococcal isolates has limited the effectiveness of currently available agents. Because early and rapid initiation of empirical antimicrobial treatment is critical for achieving a favourable outcome in CAP, newer agents with activity against drug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae and MRSA are needed for the management of patients with CAP."

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of CAP etiology in 2 groups of pediatric patients who underwent flexible bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); children with acute nonresponsive CAP (NR-CAP; n = 127) or recurrent CAP (Rec-CAP; n = 123). Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cutoff point, &gt;= 104 colony-forming units/mL) was used. Blood culture results, serological test results, nasopharyngeal secretion findings, and pleural fluid culture results were also assessed, where available. RESULTS: An infectious agent was detected in 76.0% of cases. In 51.2% of infections, aerobic bacteria were isolated, of which 75.0%, 28.9%, and 13.3% were Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Most (97.9%) of the H. influenzae strains were nontypeable (NTHi). H. influenzae was detected in 26.0% of NR-CAP cases and 51.2% of Rec-CAP cases, whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in the NR-CAP group (accounting for 34.9% of cases) but not in the Rec-CAP group (19.3%). Viruses were found in 30.4% of cases, with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenzaviruses detected most frequently. Mixed infections were found in 18.9% of NR-CAP cases and 30.1% of Rec-CAP cases. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of microorganisms were isolated with frequent mixed infection. NTHi was one of the major pathogens found, especially in association with recurrent CAP, possibly because of improved detection with the FOB with BAL procedure. This suggests that the burden of pediatric CAP could be reduced by addressing NTHi as a major causative pathogen."

Elderly people are frequently affected, and several issues related to care of this condition in the elderly have to be considered. This article reviews current recommendations of guidelines with a special focus on aspects of the care of elderly patients with CAP. The most common pathogen in CAP is still Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by other pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella species. Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, especially with regard to macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. With regard to beta-lactam antibacterials, resistance by H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is important, as is the emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main management decisions should be guided by the severity of disease, which can be assessed by validated clinical risk scores such as CURB-65, a tool for measuring the severity of pneumonia based on assessment of confusion, serum urea, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients aged &gt;=65 years. For the treatment of low-risk pneumonia, an aminopenicillin such as amoxicillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor is frequently recommended. Monotherapy with macrolides is also possible, although macrolide resistance is of concern. When predisposing factors for special pathogens are present, a beta-lactam antibacterial combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or the combination of a beta-lactam antibacterial, a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a macrolide, may be warranted. If possible, patients who have undergone previous antibacterial therapy should receive drug classes not previously used. For hospitalized patients with non-severe pneumonia, a common recommendation is empirical antibacterial therapy with an aminopenicillin in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or with fluoroquinolone monotherapy. With proven Legionella pneumonia, a combination of beta-lactams with a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide is beneficial. In severe pneumonia, ureidopenicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones are used. A combination of a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibacterial (e.g. cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), piperacillin/tazobactam and a macrolide is mostly recommended. In patients with a predisposition for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem and levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin is frequently used. Treatment duration of more than 7 days is not generally recommended, except for proven infections with P. aeruginosa, for which 15 days of treatment appears to be appropriate. Further care issues in all hospitalized patients are timely administration of antibacterials, oxygen supply in case of hypoxaemia, and fluid management and dose adjustments according to kidney function. The management of elderly patients with CAP is a challenge. Shifts in antimicrobial resistance and the availability of new antibacterials will change future clinical practice. Studies investigating new methods to detect pathogens, determine the optimal antimicrobial regimen and clarify the duration of treatment may assist in further optimizing the management of elderly patients with CAP."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in 18 patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. There was significant improvement in body temperature, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and chest X-ray score on day 3 of moxifloxacin treatment, which persisted until the completion of treatment (all p &lt; 0.05). Nine strains, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacter cloacae, were isolated from sputum cultures of nine patients. The isolated strains were eradicated by moxifloxacin. The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24 h) (AUC(0-24 h,ss))], maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), and trough plasma level (C(trough)) of moxifloxacin at steady state was 52.0 mug h/ml, 4.5, and 0.9 mug/ml, respectively. Mean AUC(0-24 h,ss)/mimimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and C(max)/MIC ratios for patients in whom MICs of moxifloxacin were determined for pathogenic bacteria were 723 and 62, respectively. The median AUC(0-24 h,ss)/MIC and C(max)/MIC ratios (based on Monte Carlo simulation employing MICs for 257 strains of S. pneumoniae collected during a respiratory infection survey by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007) were 209.56 and 17.88, respectively. Thus, when the target for the AUC/MIC ratio was set at &gt;=30 and that for the C(max)/MIC ratio at &gt;=5, the achievement rate for these two parameters was 97.36% and 96.71%, respectively. Two patients (11%) experienced three adverse effects [one nausea, another increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], but the events were not serious. Based on these results, moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) was considered useful for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and is expected to show excellent efficacy and safety as well as suppressing the emergence of resistance."

However, the detection of these organisms in the airway does not mean that they are the causative pathogens; they may exist merely as colonizers. In up to 50% cases of pneumonia, the causative pathogens remain unidentified, thereby hampering targeting therapies. In speculating on the role of a commensal organism in pneumonia, we devised the battlefield hypothesis. In the ""pneumonia battlefield,"" the organism-to-human cell number ratio may be an index for the pathogenic role of the organism. Using real-time PCR reactions for sputum samples, we tested whether the hypothesis predicts the results of bacteriological clinical tests for 4 representative commensal organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and Moraxella catarrhalis. The cutoff value for the organism-to-human cell number ratio, above which the pathogenic role of the organism was suspected, was set up for each organism using 224 sputum samples. The validity of the cutoff value was then tested in a prospective study that included 153 samples; the samples were classified into 3 groups, and each group contained 93%, 7%, and 0% of the samples from pneumonia, in which the pathogenic role of Streptococcus pneumoniae was suggested by the clinical tests. The results for Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and Moraxella catarrhalis were 100%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The battlefield hypothesis enabled legitimate interpretation of the PCR results and predicted pneumonia in which the pathogenic role of the organism was suggested by the clinical test. The PCR reactions based on the battlefield hypothesis may help to promote targeted therapies for pneumonia. The prospective observatory study described in the current report had been registered to the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) registry before its initiation, where the UMIN is a registry approved by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).

On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and associated Pacific coast tsunami struck East Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of patients with infectious diseases who needed hospitalization after this disaster. METHODS: We searched the medical records of 1,577 patients admitted to Tohoku University Hospital in the Sendai area within 1 month (March 11, 2011-April 11, 2011) after the disaster. We examined (1) changes in the rates of hospitalizations for infectious diseases over time and (2) the variety of infectious diseases. RESULTS: The number of hospitalized patients with infectious diseases increased after the fi rst week to double that during the same period in 2010. Pneumonia comprised 43% of cases, and 12% consisted of skin and subcutaneous tissue infection, including tetanus. Pneumonia was prevalent in elderly patients (median age, 78 years) with low levels of serum albumin and comorbid conditions, including brain and nervous system disorders. Sputum cultures contained Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae , known pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan. In addition, 20.5% of patients had positive results for urinary pneumococcal antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients, infectious diseases were significantly increased after the disaster compared with the same period in 2010, with pneumonia being prominent. The analyses suggest that taking appropriate measures for infectious diseases, including pneumonia, may be useful for disaster preparedness and medical response in the future."

Case 1 was a 53-year-old man with pneumonia caused by gram-positive diplococcus, identified as S. pneumoniae, who was administered 2 g of ampicillin over a period of 1 h. Gram-stained sputum showed smaller or gram-negative pneumococci at the completion of administration of the agent, a decreased number of cocci at 1 h after administration, and almost no cocci at 12 h after the completion of administration. Case 2 was a 72-year-old woman with pneumonia caused by diplococcus, identified as S. pneumoniae, who was administered 2 g of ampicillin over a period of 1 h. Gram-stained sputum showed weakly stained, small cocci at the completion of administration of the agent and few cocci at 1 h after the completion of administration. Case 3 was a 58-year-old woman with pneumonia caused by a gram-negative diplococcus, identified as Moraxella catarrhalis, who was administered 1 g of cefotaxime over a period of 30 min. Gram-stained sputum showed few extracellular cocci and some intracellular cocci inside neutrophils 1 h after administration and no cocci 2 h after the completion of administration. These three cases showed that gram-stained sputum obtained just after and/or 1 h after administration of the first antimicrobial agent were suitable as the quickest therapeutic indicator of the effectiveness of empiric therapy, with the effectiveness of the agent being shown much earlier than with markers such as the white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level."

The most commonly used methods in the determination of CAP etiology are culture and serological tests. Since early and accurate therapy reduces the mortality in CAP cases, rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed. The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial etiology in adult patients with CAP by implementing multiplex polymerase chain reaction/reverse line blot hybridization (M-PCR/RLBH) assay combined with conventional methods. A total of 128 cases (94 were male; age range: 19-81 years, mean age: 58) who were admitted to our hospital and clinically diagnosed as CAP between November 2008 - November 2010, were included in the study. Respiratory samples (sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage) obtained from patients were searched by M-PCR/RLBH method (Gen ID , Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Germany) in terms of the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila nucleic acids. The samples were simultaneously inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, haemophilus isolation agar, buffered charcoal yeast extract-selective agar and EMB agar media for cultivation. Serum samples obtained from the cases were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against C.pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence (Focus Diagnostic, USA) and against L.pneumophila and M.pneumoniae by indirect immunofluorescence (Euroimmun, Germany) methods. The bacterial etiology was identified in 59 (46.1%) of 128 patients with CAP and a total of 73 pathogens were detected. The leading organism was S.pneumoniae (n= 32, 25%), followed by H.influenzae and M.pneumoniae (n= 9, 7%), gram-negative bacilli (n= 10, 7.8%), M.catarrhalis (n= 6, 4.7%), C.pneumoniae (n= 4, 3.2%), L.pneumophila (n= 2, 1.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 1, 1.4%). Infection with atypical pathogens were detected in 15 (11.7%), and mixed infections in 14 (10.9%) patients. The detection rate of microorganisms (S.pneumoniae, H.influenzae, M.catarrhalis, C.pneumoniae, L.pneumophilia, M.pneumoniae) searched by M-PCR/RLBH method was 41.4% (53/128), while those microorganisms were detected in 23.4% (30/128) of the patients by conventional methods, representing a significant difference (p&lt; 0.05). It was concluded that M-PCR/RLBH method supplemented the determination of bacterial etiology in CAP cases by increasing the rate of detection from 23.4% to 41.4%. The results indicated that empirical treatment of CAP should primarily include antibiotics against S.pneumoniae, M.pneumoniae and H.influenzae in our region."

Nonetheless, viral infections have not been investigated routinely. We searched for bacterial and viral infections among 277 children hospitalized with CAP. Among these children 206 (74%) had radiographic confirmation, of whom 25 (12%) had PE. The aetiology was established in 18 (72%) PE cases: bacterial (n = 5; 28%), viral (n = 9; 50%), and viral-bacterial (n = 4; 22%) infections were found. Infection by rhinovirus (n = 3), enterovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2 each), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 1 each) were detected as probable sole infections. Parainfluenza virus 1/3 + influenza A virus and RSV + influenza A virus (n = 1 each) were identified as mixed viral-viral infections. Probable viral non-bacterial infection was identified in a third of the cases with CAP and PE. It is advisable to investigate viral as well as bacterial infections among children with CAP and PE."

METHODS: Respiratory secretions and venous blood samples were collected from 1560 children with CAP aged from one month to 9 years within 2 hours after admission, for detection of multiple pathogens. Respiratory virus antigens in nasopharyngeal swab specimens were detected by immunofluorescence. Sputum was used for bacterial culture. Levels of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP)-IgM and Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP)-IgM in venous blood were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 579 strains of bacteria were isolated from all respiratory secretions, including 213 (36.8%) Gram-positive strains and 366 (63.2%) Gram-negative strains. The five most common strains were Haemophilus influenzae (7.50%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.73%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.35%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.19%), and Escherichia coli (3.46%), wherein the beta-lactamase-producing strains accounted for 3.3% of all strains. The non-bacterial pathogens mainly included respiratory syncytial virus (12.88%), MP (7.88%), and CP (8.91%). Mixed infection of pathogens was serious, and the mixed infection of respiratory syncytial virus with Haemophilus influenzae infections were the most common.  For most pathogens, the infection rate was higher in children aged under one year than in those aged over one year. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus, MP and CP are the main pathogens for children with CAP. For most pathogens, the infection rate is higher in children aged under one year than in those aged over one year. Mixed infection rate of pathogens is high."

METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy."

A distinct microbiota was associated with different pneumonia etiologies. Viral pneumonia was associated with a high abundance of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) corresponding to Moraxella lacunata. Patients with nonviral pneumonia showed high abundances of OTUs of three typical bacterial pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae complex, Haemophilus influenzae complex, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Patients classified as having no definitive etiology harbored microbiota particularly enriched in the H. influenzae complex. We did not observe a commensal taxon specifically associated with health. The microbiota of the healthy nasopharynx was more diverse and contained a wider range of less abundant taxa. "

We aimed to evaluate the bacterial and viral etiology of hospitalized CAP cases and compare clinical and laboratory findings of patients with pure bacterial and bacterial and viral (mixed) infections. METHODOLOGY: A total of 55 patients hospitalized with CAP were enrolled into the prospective study between February 2010 and December 2010. Clinical and laboratory follow-up were performed on days 0, 7 and 14. Deep tracheal aspiration samples were examined for bacterial and viral pathogens by multiplex PCR, and standard bacteriological culture method. RESULTS: The etiological identification rate in 50 patients for bacteria, viruses and mixed virus-bacteria combination by PCR were 62%, 4%, 32%, respectively and 60% in 55 patients by bacterial culture method. Streptococcus pneumoniae concomitant with Haemophilus influenzae (36%) and rhinovirus (16%) was very common, whereas atypical pathogens (only Mycoplasma pneumoniae) were rare (6%). Rhinovirus was the most common viral agent (20%). Recently identified viruses, human coronavirus HKU1 and human bocavirus were not detected except for human metapneumovirus (one case). There was no significant difference in terms of mean age, immune status, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) values, hospitalization duration and CURB-65 score between bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial detections. Advanced age (p &lt; 0.01) and higher CURB-65 score (p = 0.01) were found to be associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Concomitance of bacterial and viral agents is frequent and resemble with bacterial infections alone. Further studies are needed for the clinical significance of mixed detections."

The etiology of severe pneumonia is complex and includes the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since 2012, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) has required screening for MERS-CoV for all cases of severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. We aimed to screen Hajj pilgrims admitted to healthcare facilities in 2013 with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for MERS-CoV and to determine other etiologies. METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from all pilgrims admitted to 15 healthcare facilities in the cities of Makkah and Medina, Saudi Arabia, who were diagnosed with severe CAP on admission, presenting with bilateral pneumonia. The medical records were reviewed to collect information on age, gender, nationality, and patient outcome. Samples were screened for MERS-CoV by PCR, and a respiratory multiplex array was used to detect up to 22 other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria; they were predominantly elderly (mean age 58.6 years, range 25-83 years) and male (68.4%), and all were from developing countries. Fourteen of the 38 patients died (36.8%). MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Other respiratory pathogens were detected in 26 (68.4%) samples. Of these, bacterial pathogens were detected in 84.6% (22/26) and viruses in 80.7% (21/26). Twenty-one (80.7%) samples were positive for more than one respiratory pathogen and 17 (65.3%) were positive for both bacteria and viruses. The most common respiratory virus was human rhinovirus, detected in 57.7% of the positive samples, followed by influenza A virus (23.1%) and human coronaviruses (19.2%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria, detected in 57.7% and 53.8%, respectively, of the positive samples, followed by Moraxella catarrhalis (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV was not the cause of severe CAP in any of the hospitalized pilgrims investigated. However we identified a variety of other respiratory pathogens in the sputum of this small number of patients. This indicates that the etiology of severe CAP in Hajj is complex with implications regarding its management."

Diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. Technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were &lt;5%. The use of the qPCR assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. Diagnostic accuracy of the qPCR assay varied between 60% positive agreement with standard tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 100% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Negative percentage of agreement was &gt;95% for M. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; whereas it was only 56% for Haemophilus influenzae. Multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens. We conclude that in parallel qPCR detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible. The results indicate good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens. "

","SPECIES:Moraxella catarrhalisID:25917807TITLE:Recurrent, protracted and persistent lower respiratory tract infection: A neglected clinical entity.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening disease affecting children worldwide. Recurrent pneumonia episodes can lead to the development of chronic respiratory morbidity. Chronic wet cough, a common pediatric complaint, is defined as a wet cough indicating excessive airway mucus that lasts for a minimum of 4 weeks. Most children with a chronic wet cough do not suffer from underlying debilitating pulmonary disorders. Rather, chronic wet cough is generally associated with neutrophilic airway inflammation and bacterial infections of the conducting airways. Failure to characterize endobronchial infections has led to under-recognition of chronic wet cough as an important clinical entity in children. Under-recognition and under-treatment of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), a diagnosis made by the presence of isolated cough &gt;4 weeks that resolves with appropriate antibiotic treatment, may lead to the development of chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis. The burden of bronchiectasis is highest in developing countries and in specifically vulnerable populations in developed countries, in particular indigenous children living in remote communities. The incidence, hospitalization rates and risk of long term sequelae of childhood pneumonia in indigenous children are higher than in non-indigenous children residing in the same area. The overlapping clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis are the presence of a chronic wet cough, impaired mucociliary clearance of the conducting airways, the presence of endobronchial bacterial infection (mainly non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and neutrophilic airway inflammation. The principles of managing PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis are the same. More research and public health interventions are required to improve the awareness, diagnosis and management of these causes of chronic wet cough in children. "

Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 CFUs/reaction (8333 CFUs/mL). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. The specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use."

In addition, the proportion of patients with bacterial coinfection who met the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) severe pneumonia criteria was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three risk factors for bacterial coinfection in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia: alcoholism (odds ratio [OR], 5.12; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1.60-16.4; P = 0.006), hospitalization for 2 days or more within 90 days preceding admission (OR, 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.03-3.98; P = 0.041), and residence in a nursing home or extended care facility (OR, 3.22; 95 % CI, 1.48-6.97; P = 0.003).

The samples were subjected to the RPM-IVDC1 established protocol as compared to a real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which was used as standard. The results of virus detection were consistent with those previously described. A total of 37 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, two of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of Moraxella catarrhalis were detected by RPM-IVDC1. The sensitivities and specificities were compared with those of qRT-PCR for S. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), H. influenzae (92.3, 97.9%, respectively), M. pneumoniae (69.2, 99.0%, respectively), K. pneumoniae (100, 100%, respectively), and M. catarrhalis (100, 100%, respectively). Additional 22 of Streptococcus spp., 24 of Haemophilus spp. and 16 of Neisseria spp. were identified. In addition, methicillin-resistant and carbapenemases allele were also found in nine of Staphylococcus spp. and one of K. pneumoniae, respectively. These results demonstrated the capability of RPM-IVDC1 for simultaneous detection of broad-spectrum respiratory pathogens in complex backgrounds and the advantage of accessing to the actual sequences, showing great potential use of epidemic outbreak investigation. The detection results should be carefully interpreted when introducing this technique in the clinical diagnostics. "

Its beta-lactamase-producing ability draws even more attention toward its varying patterns of resistance. METHODS: This was an observational study conducted to evaluate the prevalence and resistance pattern of M. catarrhalis. Patients aged 20-80 years admitted in the Department of Chest Medicine of Liaquat National Hospital from March 2012 to December 2012 were included in the study. Respiratory samples of sputum, tracheal secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage were included, and their cultures were followed. RESULTS: Out of 110 respiratory samples, 22 showed positive cultures for M. catarrhalis in which 14 were males and eight were females. Ten samples out of 22 showed resistance to clarithromycin, and 13 samples out of 22 displayed resistance to erythromycin, whereas 13 showed resistance to levofloxacin. Hence, 45% of the cultures showed resistance to macrolides so far and 59% showed resistance to quinolones. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that in our environment, M. catarrhalis may be resistant to macrolides and quinolones; hence, these should not be recommended as an alternative treatment in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections caused by M. catarrhalis. However, a study of larger sample size should be conducted to determine if the recommendations are required to be changed."

METHOD: A retrospective analysis included 182 children in Children's Hospital of Fudan University, diagnosed with measles from January 1, 2012 to December 31. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, including the gender, age, the incidence of seasonal trends, measles vaccine vaccination history, contact history and other clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and so on were analyzed. And the reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was adopted to detect sputum specimens from suspected patients with measles,who were selected randomly,the sequence of the part of the PCR products was analyzed. RESULT: (1) Clinical and epidemiological data: Totally were 182 children with measles (125 males, 57 females) were enrolled into this study. The age of the patients ranged from 3 months to 89 months, 127 cases were younger than 9 months (69. 8%). The prevalence season was from April to August, while the peak month was April and May (22. 5%, 23. 1%). Among 182 hospitalized children, only 11 cases underwent measles vaccination (6. 0%), and among them 5 cases were within 2 weeks before disease onset. A total of 167 cases (91. 8%) had not been vaccinated, most of whom were immigrants, and the measles vaccination history of the remaining 4 cases were unknown. There was a positive correlation between the measles vaccination ratio in children of the floating population (8. 45%, 6/71) and the settled children (29.4%, 5/17, chi =8. 11 P =0. 004). In total, 24 cases (13. 2%) had definite measles exposure history, with 153 cases (84. 1%) of unknown origin,5 cases (2.7%) without any history of contact. (2) Clinical manifestations: All the 182 patients had fever (100%) and obvious rashes (100%), among them 145 cases had body temperature higher than 39  C (79. 7%). The fever period ranged from 2 to 38 days. Among 182 hospitalized children,165 cases (90. 7%) had typical measles,17 cases had atypical measles. Among the 17 cases, two had severe measles, one had heterotypic measles. (3) The common complica tions: 96 cases had pneumonia (52. 8%), 80 had laryngitis (44. 0%), 38 had bronchitis (20. 9%),15 had hepatic dysfunction (8. 2%), 11 had myocardial damage (6. 0%), 3 had febrile seizures (1. 6%), and no patient had encephalitis. Of the 96 cases with pneumonia, 92 received sputum test; 38 were sputum culture positive (41%). The dominant pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae(11/38,29%), Haemophilus influenzae (6/ 38,16%), Moraxella catarrhalis (4/38, 11%), Escherichia coli (4/38, 11%), Candida albicans (4/38, 11%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4/38, 11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (3/38, 8%). (4) The H1a genotype was the only one genotype in the detected sequence of 54 measles virus strains. CONCLUSION: Measles was more often seen in the children under the age of 9 months from the floating population. The morbidity peak month was from April to May in Shanghai. The H1a genotype was the only one genotype. We should try to improve vaccination coverage rate in the children who are at the age for vaccination, so as to prevent measles outbreak."

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the dominant bacterial microorganisms involved in acute sinusitis, whereas in chronic sinusitis, Staphylococcus aureus and some anaerobic bacteria are the prevailing pathogens. Appropriate antibiotic treatment requires sinusitis bacteriology assessment. The aim of this study was to isolate bacteria in clinical samples from patients with chronic sinusitis. METHODS: A total of 55 samples were collected from patients with chronic sinusitis undergoing surgery at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz, Iran. Samples were cultured in conventional medium, and for each culture, Gram staining, catalase, coagulase, oxidase, and DNAse tests were performed and isolates were stored for polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three isolates were obtained from five patients, including S. aureus (23.6%), Rhizomucor (1.8%), and Escherichia (1.8%) by the culture method and M. catarrhalis (3.6%) and S. Pneumoniae (7.2%) by the polymerase chain reaction method. Compared with acute sinusitis, the microbiology of chronic sinusitis remains controversial. Results are affected by many factors, including diversity of molecular and culture methods, sterilization of sampling area, sample transfer to laboratory, use of antibiotics prior to surgery, and nasal polyps. CONCLUSION: In Iran, the causative agents of chronic sinusitis are similar to those in other countries. Compared with other bacteria, S. aureus was observed more often in asthmatic patients with sinusitis."

Herein, we report a case of non-invasive meningococcal pneumonia initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia due to Moraxella catarrhalis on the basis of a Gram stain in a 43-year-old woman with asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and schizophrenia. She visited our hospital following a 3-day history of fever, productive cough, and shortness of breath. Since her sputum smear revealed Gram-negative diplococcus and the chest radiograph showed infiltration in the lower right lung field, her initial diagnosis was pneumonia caused by M. catarrhalis. However, the next day, the sputum culture colonies were unlike those of M. catarrhalis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis revealed the pathogen to be N. meningitidis. As a result, we administered the appropriate treatment and ensured adequate infection prevention and control measures including, droplet precautions and prophylaxis provided to close contacts. Secondary infection did not occur. Although meningococcal pneumonia is not common, physicians should consider N. meningitidis when Gram-negative diplococci are observed in respiratory specimens, as N. meningitidis cannot be distinguished from M. catarrhalis with Gram staining alone. Moreover, it is also important to monitor the appearance of the pathogenic colonies and to closely coordinate with laboratory technicians to determine appropriate treatments. In this article, we review the previous case reports of meningococcal pneumonia reported in 1984-2015 in Japan, summarizing the clinical characteristics and comparing previous reviews of the literature."

METHODS: NP swabs collected from children (N = 960) aged 2 months to 10 years, and with a temperature &gt;=38 C, were utilized to quantify bacterial density of S. pneumoniae (Sp), H. influenzae (Hi), M. catarrhalis (Mc), S. aureus (Sa), and N. meningitidis (Nm). We determined associations between presence of individual species, densities, or concurrent carriage of all species combination with respiratory diseases including clinical pneumonia, pneumonia with normal chest radiography (CXR) and endpoint pneumonia. RESULTS: Individual carriage, and NP density, of Sp, Hi, or Mc, but not Sa, or Nm, was significantly associated with febrile ARI and clinical pneumonia when compared to febrile non-ARI episodes. Density was also significantly increased in severe pneumonia when compared to mild URTI (Sp, p&lt;0.002; Hi p&lt;0.001; Mc, p = 0.014). Accordingly, concurrent carriage of Sp+, Hi+, and Mc+, in the absence of Sa- and Nm-, was significantly more prevalent in children with ARI (p = 0.03), or clinical pneumonia (p&lt;0.001) than non-ARI, and in children with clinical pneumonia (p = 0.0007) than URTI. Furthermore, Sp+, Hi+, and Mc+ differentiated children with pneumonia with normal CXR, or endpoint pneumonia, from those with URTI, and non-ARI cases.

We retrospectively investigated the characteristics of hospitalizations due to pulmonary infection in patients with IPF to elucidate causative pathogens and mortality. We reviewed patients with IPF who were admitted between January 2008 and December 2014 for pulmonary infections including pneumonia and bronchitis. The causative pathogen, the relationship between the site of pneumonia and existing IPF radiological patterns on high-resolution chest CT, and predictors of mortality were evaluated. Forty-eight IPF patients were hospitalized a totally of 81 times due to pulmonary infection during the study period. In the 48 first-time admissions after IPF diagnosis, causative pathogens were detected in 20 patients (41.6%). The most common pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae (14.5%) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.1%), Branhamella catarrhalis (4.1%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%). Among all 81 admissions, the most common pathogen was P. aeruginosa (12.3%), followed by H. influenzae (8.6%), S. aureus (6.1%) and Escherichia coli (4.9%). No relationship was observed between the detected pathogen and the site of pneumonia. The 30-day and hospital mortality rates were 14.5% and 18.7%, respectively. Pneumonia severity index on admission was significantly associated with both 30-day and hospital mortality. In conclusion, IPF patients hospitalized for pulmonary infections had high 30-day and hospital mortality. In contrast to community-acquired pneumonia, the causative pathogens mainly consisted of gram-negative bacteria. The PSI score may be a significant predictor of mortality. These results provide information for empiric antibiotic selection when treating IPF patients with pulmonary infections."

The authors aimed to evaluate the role of the chest radiograph to identify cases of community-aquired pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. METHODS: The frequency of infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis was compared in non-hospitalized children with clinical diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia aged 2-59 months with or without radiological confirmation (n=249 and 366, respectively). Infection by S. pneumoniae was diagnosed by the detection of a serological response against at least one of eight pneumococcal proteins (defined as an increase &gt;=2-fold in the IgG levels against Ply, CbpA, PspA1 and PspA2, PhtD, StkP-C, and PcsB-N, or an increase &gt;=1.5-fold against PcpA). Infection by H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was defined as an increase &gt;=2-fold on the levels of microbe-specific IgG. RESULTS: Children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia had higher rates of infection by S. pneumoniae. The presence of pneumococcal infection increased the odds of having radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 2.8 times (95% CI: 1.8-4.3). The negative predictive value of the normal chest radiograph for infection by S. pneumoniae was 86.3% (95% CI: 82.4-89.7%). There was no difference on the rates of infection by H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis between children with community-acquired pneumonia with and without radiological confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Among children with clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia submitted to chest radiograph, those with radiologically confirmed pneumonia present a higher rate of infection by S. pneumoniae when compared with those with a normal chest radiograph."

The inhaled foreign body may act as carrier of infectious material and the aim of this study was to explore the bacterial species associated with aspirated foreign bodies in a cohort of children. METHODS: Retrospective case series of 34 patients who underwent rigid laryngobronchoscopy because of foreign body aspiration. Each patient had a sample taken from tracheobronchial secretions during the procedure. RESULTS: The average patient age was 31.2 months and the average hospital stay was 2.5 days. Of the foreign bodies 24 (71%) were organic in nature and 10 (29%) were non-organic. Twenty eight (82.3%) patients had mixed oropharyngeal flora organisms growth. Fifteen (44%) samples were positive for organisms other than oropharyngeal flora with the most common cultured organisms being: Streptococcus pneumonia (4/12%), Haemophilus influenza (4/12%), Moraxella catarrhalis (4/12%). Four samples (12%) grew a fungus; Candida albicans was cultured in 3 patients and Aspergillus glaucus was identified in one sample. Of the non-oropharyngeal organisms 7(47%) demonstrated antibiotic resistance with four having resistance to amoxycillin, two resistant to penicillin and one resistant to cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSION: Some children who present with aspirated foreign body may be complicated with secondary airway infection. Antibacterial treatment might be considered in some of these cases.

Therefore, we evaluated the bacteriological incidence in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of pneumonia patients using cultivation and a culture-independent molecular method. Japanese patients with community-acquired pneumonia (83) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (94) between April 2010 and February 2014 were evaluated. The BALF obtained from pneumonia lesions was evaluated by both cultivation and a molecular method. In the molecular method, ~600 base pairs of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes in the BALF were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and clone libraries were constructed. The nucleotide sequences of 96 randomly selected colonies were determined, and a homology search was performed to identify the bacterial species. A qualitative radiological evaluation of pulmonary emphysema based on chest computed tomography (CT) images was performed using the Goddard classification. The severity of pulmonary emphysema based on the Goddard classification was none in 47.4% (84/177), mild in 36.2% (64/177), moderate in 10.2% (18/177), and severe in 6.2% (11/177). Using the culture-independent molecular method, Moraxella catarrhalis was significantly more frequently detected in moderate or severe emphysema patients than in patients with no or mild emphysematous changes. The detection rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unrelated to the severity of pulmonary emphysematous changes, and Streptococcus species - except for the S. anginosus group and S. pneumoniae - were detected more frequently using the molecular method we used for the BALF of patients with pneumonia than using culture methods. Our findings suggest that M. catarrhalis is more frequently detected in pneumonia patients with moderate or severe emphysema than in those with no or mild emphysematous changes on chest CT. M. catarrhalis may play a major role in patients with pneumonia complicating severe pulmonary emphysema."

","SPECIES:Moraxella catarrhalisID:28981235TITLE:[Lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent adult].ABSTRACT:Lower respiratory tract infections represent one of the main causes of mortality in the world. They essentially consist of bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary diseases (COPD) and acute pneumonia. If acute bronchitis is mainly of viral origin, acute exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia are mainly due to a trio of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Other pathogens as many viruses and atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella, some Enterobacteriaceae and very rarely Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also implicated. S. pneumoniae is the pathogen associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality and empirical antibiotic treatment should always be active on this germ. According to the type of infection and factors of comorbidity, empirical antibiotic treatment should cover a number of other pathogens. Beta-lactams, associated or not with macrolides/azalides are the first line treatment. Fluoroquinolones, although highly active against all pathogens, must be used only in restricted situations in order to avoid emergence of resistance to these antibiotics."

However, it is difficult to identify pneumococcal infection among children with CAP. We aimed to assess association between any cytokine/chemokine and pneumococcal infection in childhood CAP. Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic value of cytokine/chemokine for pneumococcal infection. This prospective study was conducted at an Emergency Room, in Salvador, Brazil. Children &lt;5-years-old hospitalized with CAP in a 21-month period were evaluated. On admission, clinical and radiological data were collected along with biological samples to investigate 20 etiological agents and determine serum cytokines (interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1beta, IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, gamma-interferon), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10) concentration. From 166 patients with etiology detected, pneumococcal infection was detected in 38 (22.9%) cases among which the median IL-6(pg/ml) was 31.2 (IQR: 12.4-54.1). The other 128 cases had other causative agents detected (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, atypical bacteria and viruses) with the median IL-6 concentration being 9.0 (IQR: 4.1-22.0; p &lt; 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for IL-6 to predict pneumococcal CAP was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.65-0.83; p &lt; 0.001). By multivariate analysis, with pneumococcal CAP as dependent variable, IL-6 was an independent predictor for pneumococcal infection (OR = 5.56; 95%CI: 2.42-12.75, cut-off point = 12.5 pg/ml; p = 0.0001). The negative predictive value of IL-6 under 12.5 pg/ml for pneumococcal infection was 90% (95%CI: 82-95%). Independently significant difference was not found for any other cytokines/chemokines. Serum IL-6 concentration on admission is independently associated with pneumococcal infection among children under-5 years hospitalized with CAP."

Children aged less than 18 years who were hospitalized with LRTIs were enrolled from January 2013 to December 2015. Respiratory specimens were collected for the detection of common respiratory viruses, atypical bacteria, and other bacteria using current laboratory diagnostic tests. The epidemiological characteristics of the respiratory pathogens were analyzed. Of the 10,123 specimens obtained from the patients, 5,966 (58.7%) were positive for at least 1 pathogen. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) was the most commonly detected pathogen (15.7%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.9%). Co-infections were found in 11.4% of patients. Of these co-infections, viral-bacterial co-infections were the most common. The detection rates for the respiratory pathogens varied considerably by age. RSV was the most common pathogen in children aged less than 24 months. Clear seasonal peaks were observed for RSV, M. pneumoniae, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenza infections.

BAL fluid (BALF) was collected from 191 children (aged &gt;= 6 months to &lt; 6 years, with persistent or recurrent respiratory symptoms, non-responders to usual treatment) and cultured. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were also obtained and cultured to assess concordance of BALF and NPS findings in the same patient. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis were identified from BALF with a bacterial load indicative of infection (&gt; 104 colony-forming units/mL) in 10.5, 8.9, and 6.3% of children, respectively. Clinical characteristics were similar among participants, regardless of positivity status for any of the bacteria. Approximately 26% of pneumococcal isolates were PCV13 serotypes, and 96% of H. influenzae isolates were non-typeable (NTHi). Concordance between BALF and NPS isolates was 51.0% for S. pneumoniae, 52.1% for H. influenzae, and 22.0% for M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae, NTHi, and M. catarrhalis were the main bacteria detected in BALF and NPS. Children with suspected chronic LRTI may benefit from a vaccine protecting against NTHi. What is Known:   Chronic lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children can cause high morbidity and is a major use of healthcare resources worldwide. Despite this, their etiology or potential preventive measures are poorly assessed.   Bronchoalveolar lavage can be used to determine bacterial etiology of chronic LRTI. What is New:   We used conventional and molecular techniques to show that Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were present in the LRT of Spanish children with suspected chronic LRTI   Concordance between isolates from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs was low, suggesting that samples from the upper respiratory tract could not reliably predict the bacterial etiology of suspected chronic LRTI."

However, there is dearth of data on the colonization and drug resistance pattern of the main bacterial pathogens in the pharynx of HIV infected children in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the pharyngeal colonization and drug resistance profile of bacterial pathogens in HIV infected children attending ART clinic of Felegehiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Amhara Region, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2016 to June 2017 at the ART clinic of FHRH. A total of 300 HIV infected children were enrolled in the study. Data on socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants were collected with face-to-face interview and patient-card review using structured questionnaire. Bacterial species were identified using standard bacteriological techniques. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion technique. Chi-square test was done to determine associations among variables. RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 11 years. Overall, 153 (51%) of children were colonized by respiratory bacteria in their pharynx. Colonization rate was higher in children from mothers who had attained college and above levels of education than others (P = 0.04). It was also higher in children without the sign of malnutrition than others (P = 0.004). The colonization rate of S.aureus, M.catarrhalis, S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae were 88 (29%), 37 (12.3%), 31 (10.3%) and 6 (2%), respectively. S.aureus-M.catarrhalis concurrent colonization was found in 14 (4.7%) of children. Age (P = 0.03), schooling (P = 0.045) and history of running nose (P = 0.043) were significantly associated with S.aureus colonization. Living in urban setting (P = 0.042) and children from mothers with college and above levels of education (P = 0.002) were significantly associated with M.catarrhalis colonization. Majority of the isolates were resistant to penicillin (68.5%) and cotrimoxazole (52.5%).S.aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin (84.1%) and cotrimoxazole (51.1%).M.catarrhalis isolates were resistant to penicillin (94.6%), erythromycin (86.5%)and cotrimoxazole (78.4%). Overall, 99 (59.3%) of the isolates were multi-drug (MDR) resistant. The overall MDR rates among S.aureus, M.catarrhalis and S.pneumoniae isolates were 65.9%, 78.4% and 22.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngeal colonization of respiratory bacteria in HIV infected children is a major public health problem. Single and multiple antibiotic resistant is alarmingly high among respiratory colonizers. Therefore, regular screening of HIV infected children for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended to prevent the development of severe opportunistic infections."

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term ""communityacquired pneumonia"". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Patents were searched using the key term ""community-acquired pneumonia"" from www.google.com/patents, http://espacenet.com, and www. freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS: Generally, viruses, notably respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common cause of community- acquired pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause across all age groups. Other important bacterial causes in children younger than 5 years include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In children 5 years or older, in addition to S. pneumoniae, other important bacterial causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. In the majority of cases, bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably distinguished from each other on clinical grounds. In practice, most children with pneumonia are treated empirically with antibiotics; the choice of which depends on the patient's age and most likely pathogen. Recent patents related to the management of community-acquired pneumonia are discussed. CONCLUSION: In previously healthy children under the age of 5 years, high dose amoxicillin is the treatment of choice. For those with type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives. For children with a non-type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cefixime, cefprozil, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime should be considered. In previously healthy children over the age of 5 years, macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are the drugs of choice."

While the majority of infants display only mild upper respiratory tract infection or occasionally otitis media, around one-third will develop an infection of the lower respiratory tract, usually bronchiolitis. There is now convincing evidence from a number of cohorts that respiratory syncytial virus is a significant, independent risk factor for later wheezing, at least within the first decade of life. The wide variation in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection suggests that susceptibility and disease are influenced by multiple host-intrinsic factors. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old white girl presented to our Pediatric Allergy Clinic with recurrent crackles in addition to cough, fevers, and labored breathing since her first respiratory syncytial virus infection at the age of 7 months. She had been under the care of pulmonologists, who suspected childhood interstitial lung disease. She was hospitalized eight times due to exacerbation of symptoms and prescribed systemic and inhaled steroids, short-acting beta2-mimetics, and antileukotriene. There was no short-term clinical improvement at that time between hospitalizations. During her hospital stay at the Pneumonology and Cystic Fibrosis Department in Rabka a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Laboratory bacteriological tests found high colony count of Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, in bronchial secretions and swabs from her nose. After this, infections were treated with antibiotics; she remained in good condition without symptoms. Crackles and wheezing recurred only during symptoms of infections. Therefore, we hypothesize that respiratory syncytial virus infection at an early age might cause severe damage of the lung epithelium and prolonged clinical symptoms, mainly crackles and wheezing, each time the child has a respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the importance of respiratory syncytial virus infection in an immunocompetent child. Pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion and knowledge of recurrent symptoms associated with severe damage of the lung epithelium to establish the correct diagnosis."

While pneumonia is commonly observed during RSV infection, the burden and epidemiology of bacterial superinfection is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms associated with RSV-positive pneumonia in adults. A retrospective study was conducted during three consecutive winters (October to April 2013-2016) in the University Hospital of Lyon, France. During RSV circulation periods, a systematic RSV screening was performed by reverse-transcription PCR on all respiratory samples collected from adults. Records of RSV-positive patients were subsequently analyzed to identify radiologically confirmed pneumonia cases. Bacteria were identified by standard bacteriology cultures or urinary antigen screening and classified as potentially causative of pneumonia if quantification was above the specific threshold as defined by the European Manual of Clinical Microbiology. Overall, 14,792 adult respiratory samples were screened for RSV detection by PCR. In total, 292 had a positive RSV detection (2.0%) among which 89 presented with pneumonia including 27 bacterial superinfections (9.3%) with Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Most patients were elderly (55.6%) and patients with comorbidities (77.8%). A more severe outcome was observed for RSV-bacteria-associated pneumonia compared with RSV pneumonia: length of stay was significantly longer (16 days vs 10 days) and ICU hospitalization more frequent (66.7% vs 21.0%) (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, we did not observe major differences in the epidemiology of bacterial superinfections in RSV-positive pneumonia compared to reports on post-influenza pneumonia."

Empiric therapy for CAP frequently consists of beta-lactam monotherapy or beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. However, such agents are often ineffective against S. aureus and do not reflect the emergence and increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community setting. Ceftaroline fosamil is a fifth-generation parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive pathogens - such as S. aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes - and typical Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The approval of ceftaroline fosamil in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe CAP was based on two phase 3 trials (FOCUS 1 and 2), which demonstrated that ceftaroline fosamil was non-inferior to ceftriaxone, a standard empiric treatment for CAP, while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. Although head-to-head trials of ceftaroline fosamil versus comparators against MRSA CAP are lacking, the effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in subpopulations of patients not covered by phase 3 trials (e.g. those with MRSA CAP or severe renal impairment) has been demonstrated in the Clinical Assessment Program and Teflaro Utilization Registry (CAPTURE) study. As ineffective empiric therapy is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality and increased costs, ceftaroline fosamil, with its extended spectrum of activity, is an attractive alternative to standard antibiotic CAP regimens."

In Indigenous children hospitalised with pneumonia in Central Australia, we describe the nasopharyngeal detection of viruses and bacteria and assessed whether their presence related to signs of pneumonia (tachypnoea and/or chest in-drawing) on hospital admission and during subsequent days. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and data were prospectively collected from 145 children (median age = 23.5 months, interquartile range [IQR] 8.7-50) hospitalised with pneumonia at Alice Springs Hospital, Australia, between April 2001 and July 2002. The cohort was enrolled in a randomised controlled study using zinc and/or vitamin A supplementation. NPS were taken within 24 hours of hospitalisation and kept frozen at-80 C until analysed in 2014. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and 16 respiratory viruses. Uni- and multi-variate analyses were used to examine the relationships. One or more organisms were present in 137 (94.5%) NPS; 133 (91.7%) detected >= 1 bacterium, 34 (37.2%) for >= 1 virus and 50 (34.5%) were positive for both viruses and bacteria.

However the presence of bacteria and/or virus type was not associated with tachypnoea and/or chest in-drawing on admission or during recovery. In children with high nasopharyngeal microbial colonisation rates, the utility of NPS in determining the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia or duration of tachypnoea or in-drawing is likely limited.

The implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV13) and enhanced antimicrobial control (2013-2015) by the government may have changed the antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Four respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Moraxella catarrhalis) isolated in a single medical center during 2008-2017 were studied. We defined three temporal stages: (a) the first era (2008-2012), prior to implementation of the national immunization program (PCV13 vaccination), (b) the second era (2013-2015), during which an enhanced antibiotic control strategy was implemented, and (c) the third era (2016-2017), after implementation. Antimicrobial drug sensitivities were collected from two other hospitals: one from east Taiwan, one from west-central Taiwan. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae was frequently isolated during the first era. It declined progressively during the second era of PCV13 vaccination. S. pyogenes and M. catarrhalis were not frequently isolated. The drug susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to ceftriaxone and vancomycin remained high. The antimicrobial susceptibility of H. influenzae to amoxillin/clavulante declined over the three temporal stages, from 91.9%-79.5%-58.5% (all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance of H. influenzae increased during the latter part of the study period. The PCV13 vaccination program reduced the invasive pneumococcal disease and reduced the stress on the emergent drug resistance. This enhanced antibiotic control strategy was effective in terms of nosocomial drug resistance but not for community-associated pathogens."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 15 047 children who attended the hospital due to respiratory infection from January 2016 to December 2018. Their sputum samples were collected, and the Phoenix-100 automatic microbial identification system was used for the identification and drug sensitivity analysis of the isolated pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Of all 17 174 sputum samples detected, there were 2 395 positive samples, with a positive rate of 13.95%; a total of 2 584 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated, among which there were 1 577 (61.03%) Gram-negative strains, 967 (37.42%) Gram-positive strains, and 40 (1.55%) fungal strains. The most common pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae (33.90%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (33.55%), Moraxella catarrhalis (19.20%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3.64%). Among the 2 331 children with positive infection, 251 had mixed infection, most commonly with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The detection rate of pathogenic bacteria was higher in winter and spring and lower in summer and autumn. There was a significant difference in the detection rate of pathogenic bacteria between different age groups (P&lt;0.05), with the highest detection rate in infants aged 1 month to &lt;1 year. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus had a sensitivity rate of 100% to vancomycin, linezolid, and teicoplanin, and Haemophilus influenzae had a lower sensitivity rate to ampicillin, compound sulfamethoxazole and cefuroxime and a higher sensitivity rate to other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the main pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infection in children, and mixed infection is the most common type of infection. The detection rate of pathogenic bacteria varies across seasons and ages. Different pathogenic bacteria have different features of drug resistance, and antibiotics should be selected based on drug sensitivity results."

This phenomenon is called asymptomatic carriage. However, in case of decreased immunity, viral infection or any other enhancing factors, severe disease can develop. Our aim in this study was to survey the nasal carriage rates of four important respiratory pathogens in three different age groups of children attending nurseries, day-care centres and primary schools. This is the first study from Hungary about the asymptomatic carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. METHODS: Altogether 580 asymptomatic children were screened in three Hungarian cities. Samples were collected from both nostrils with cotton swabs. The identification was based on both colony morphology and species-specific PCRs. Serotyping was performed for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined with agar dilution, according to the EUCAST guidelines. Clonality was examined by PFGE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the carriage rates of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis clearly decreased with age, that of S. aureus showed an opposite tendency. Multiple carriage was least prevalent if S. aureus was one of the participants. The negative association between this bacterium and the others was statistically significant. For pneumococcus, the overall carriage rate was lower compared to earlier years, and PCV13 serotypes were present in only 6.2% of the children. The majority of H. influenzae isolates was non-typeable and no type b was detected; serotype A was dominant among M. catarrhalis. All four bacteria were more sensitive to antibiotics compared to clinical isolates. No MRSAs were detected, but we found three mupirocin resistant strains. The positive effect of Hib- and PCV-vaccination is undoubted. Continued surveillance of these pathogens is required."

He developed fever and chills during hospitalization. Physical examination revealed a fever of 39.1  C, but there were no findings on history or physical examination to suggest the source of the infection. Gram-negative cocci were detected in the blood culture (Fig. 1) and in a Gram stained sputum smear (Figs. 3 and 4). Neisseria meningitis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were ruled out based on history and an absence of suggestive symptoms. The cause of his fever was diagnosed as Moraxella catarrhalis bacteremic pneumonia based on the blood culture and the sputum smear results, and he was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. This case illustrates the importance of Gram staining of sputum and blood culture. Moraxella catarrhalis should be considered in the differential diagnosis when gram-negative cocci are detected in the blood and the sputum."

The emergence of the first antibiotic-resistant strain of M. catarrhalis was noted in 1977 in Sweden. This has gradually spread worldwide over the years to more than 95% of the strains showing resistance to penicillin now. Penicillin resistance is mediated by the production of beta-lactamases encoded by bro-1 and bro-2 genes that code for beta-lactamases BRO-1 and BRO-2, respectively.

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests. Our patient showed remarkable clinical and laboratory improvement with the therapy mentioned above."

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal samples from children aged <= 6 years with upper respiratory tract infection (n=14,473) in South Sweden were analysed during 14 consecutive years; 5 years prior to and 9 years following PCV introduction. The yearly prevalence was calculated, and multivariate count regressions between prevalence and estimated yearly proportions of vaccinated children were performed. Associations between pneumococcal serotypes and the other pathogens were assessed. RESULTS: When comparing the pre-vaccine period with the years following introduction, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae decreased by 65.5% (16.6 to 5.7 per 1,000 individuals; p<0.001), whereas M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae decreased by 52.6% (21.7 to 10.3 per 1,000 individuals; p<0.001) and 47.1% (13.7 to 7.3 per 1,000 individuals; p<0.001), respectively. In multivariate negative binomial regressions adjusted for yearly numbers of samples taken, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis were significantly negatively associated with increasing vaccine coverage proportions (aPR (adjusted prevalence rate) =0.17; p<0.001, and aPR=0.48; p<0.001, respectively), whereas H. influenzae (aPR=0.75; p=0.17) was not. In addition, the proportion of cultures positive for S. pneumoniae as well as M. catarrhalis was significantly lower in the post-vaccine period compared to the pre-vaccine period, while this was not the case for H. influenzae. A significant positive association between certain PCV serotypes and simultaneous growth with M. catarrhalis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Following introduction of PCV, the prevalence of M. catarrhalis in addition to S. pneumoniae in children with respiratory tract infection decreased, also after adjusting for reduced numbers of samples taken. This may partly be attributed to a positive association between PCV serotypes and M. catarrhalis."

Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children's Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."

Evaluation of the frequency of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis and Moraxella catarrhalis in healthy children was the main aim of the current study. In this cross-sectional study, 123 oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children between 2 and 6 years old in kindergartens of Ilam, Iran. Moraxella catarrhalis and N. meningitidis were identified using phenotypic and genotypic assays. In addition, the occurrence of the virulence factors (ctrA and uspA1) and iron uptake (tbpA) genes was evaluated by PCR. Results showed that 21 M. catarrhalis isolates and 17 N. meningitidis isolates were identified by conventional microbiological and biochemical methods, but the RT-PCR assay detected that 18 and 8 isolates were positive for M. catarrhalis and N. meningitidis, respectively. The tbpA gene was positive in all N. meningitidis and M. catarrhalis isolates. Seven isolates were positive for the ctrA gene in N. meningitidis and seven isolates were positive for the uspA1 gene in M. catarrhalis. These pathogenic bacteria often occurred as asymptomatic carriage of N. meningitidis in children from large families with low economic status, which reflects the importance of the environment and socio-economic level of families in the distribution of these potentially pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx of children. Monitoring for the carriage of potential pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharynx of healthy children is important as this can predispose to infectious diseases; common exposure to human respiratory bacterial pathogens is a further risk factor."

The aim of this study was to determine whether nasal and/or oropharyngeal microbiota profiles are associated with age and RTIs. METHODS: Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs of 152 controls and 152 patients with an RTI were included. The latter group consisted of 72 patients with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and 80 with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were subjected to microbiota profiling using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Moraxella species were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and culture. RESULTS: Based on the microbiota profiles of the controls and the patients with an RTI, eight nasal and nine oropharyngeal microbiota clusters were defined. Nasal microbiota dominated by either Moraxella catarrhalis or Moraxella nonliquefaciens was significantly more prevalent in elderly compared to mid-aged adults in the control group (p = 0.002). Dominance by M. catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens was significantly less prevalent in elderly with an LRTI (p = 0.001) compared to controls with similar age. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal microbiota dominated by M. catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens is associated with respiratory health in the elderly population."

We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure. RESULTS: From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the predictors of co-infection together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia."

Both had progressive symptoms despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and developed involvement of other systems, ultimately requiring admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). They were subsequently diagnosed with the same condition and made an excellent recovery.The first girl, 14 years old, originally presented to her general practitioner with a sore throat, nasal congestion, and fever. Despite multiple courses of antibiotics over the following month she presented again multiple times with progressive symptoms including epistaxis, widespread myalgia and arthralgia, difficulty in breathing, haemoptysis, fatigue, and weight loss. Examination on admission found minimal discharge from her right tympanic membrane, ulcerated inferior turbinates with dried blood and yellow mucus in both nasal cavities, swollen tonsils without exudate, and an isolated aphthous ulcer on the tip of her tongue. She had small bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the cardiovascular system was unremarkable but on respiratory examination there was reduced air entry on the right side. Her abdomen was generally tender but soft with no organomegaly. A week into her admission she developed an oxygen requirement and increased work of breathing requiring intubation and ventilation.The second girl, 13 years old, presented to her local hospital with a 1-day history of epistaxis, right ear pain, and pain and swelling to the right periorbital tissues. Again, despite multiple courses of antibiotics, she had persistent symptoms and subsequently developed fever, fatigue, haemoptysis, and had a syncopal episode. She was admitted to her local district general hospital and, despite initial treatment, deteriorated over the following 2 weeks with persistent fever, new oxygen requirement, deteriorating renal function, and anaemia.

Based on its relatively benign course with late distant relapses, relation with lymph node hyperplasia with progressively transformed germinal centers, presence of clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements with somatic hypermutations and ongoing mutations, and relation with a number of inherited defects affecting the immune system, it has been suspected that NLPHL might be antigen driven. Recent evidence has shown that cases of IgD-positive NLPHL are associated with infection by Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterium in the upper respiratory tract and in lymph nodes. This review summarizes the evidence for NLPHL as a B-cell lymphoma involving follicular T-lymphocytes normally found in germinal centers, its molecular features and relation to inherited immune defects, and its relation and differential diagnosis from similar entities. Finally, it discusses the evidence that in many cases a watch and wait policy might be a viable initial management strategy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in the childhood immunization programme in 2013 but the serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are unknown. We did a cross-sectional nasopharyngeal carriage study in Luanda and Saurimo, Angola (PCV13 3rd dose coverage 67% and 84%, respectively) during November to December 2017 comprising 940 children aged 4-12 years. The main objective was to assess vaccine serotype coverage and antimicrobial susceptibility rates for S. pneumoniae. Our secondary aim was to characterize colonizinig strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pneumococcal colonization was found in 35% (95% CI 32-39%) of children (n = 332), with 41% of serotypes covered by PCV13. The most common serotypes were 3 (8%), 18C (6%), 23F (6%), 11A (6%), 34 (6%), 19F (5%) and 16 (5%). Carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was detected in 13% (95% CI 11-15%) and 15% (95% CI 13-17%) of children, respectively. Non-susceptibility to penicillin was common among pneumococci (40%), particularly among PCV13-included serotypes (50% vs. 33%; p = 0.003), although the median minimal inhibitory concentration was low (0.19 microg/mL, IQR 0.13-0.25 microg/mL). Most pneumococci and H. influenzae were susceptible to amoxicillin (99% and 88%, respectively). Furthermore, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was>70% among all three species. Multidrug-resistant pneumococci (non-susceptible to >= 3 antibiotics; 7% [n = 24]) were further studied with whole genome sequencing to investigate clonality as an underlying cause for this phenotype. No clearly dominating clone(s) were, however, detected. The results indicate that continued use of PCV13 may have positive direct and herd effects on pneumococcal infections in Angola as carriage of vaccine serotypes was common in the non-vaccinated age group. Finally, amoxicillin is assessed to be a feasible empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections in Angola."

Since S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP globally, it is important to distinguish between MC-CAP and CAP due to S. pneumoniae (SP-CAP) in clinical practice. However, no past study compared clinical characteristics of MC-CAP and SP-CAP by statistical analysis. We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of MC-CAP by comparing those of SP-CAP, as well as the utility of sputum Gram staining. METHODS: This retrospective study screened CAP patients aged over 20 years visiting or admitted to Okinawa Miyako Hospital between May 2013 and April 2018. Among these, we included patients whom either M. catarrhalis alone or S. pneumoniae alone was isolated from their sputum by bacterial cultures. RESULTS: We identified 134 MC-CAP and 130 SP-CAP patients. Although seasonality was not observed in SP-CAP, almost half of MC-CAP patients were admitted in the winter. Compared to those with SP-CAP, MC-CAP patients were older (p < 0.01) and more likely to have underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma and bronchiectasis (p < 0.01). Approximately half of asthmatic MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients had asthma attacks. Although winter is an influenza season in Japan, co-infection with influenza virus was less common in MC-CAP compared to SP-CAP patients (3% vs. 15%, p < 0.01). Bronchopneumonia patterns on X-ray, as well as bronchial wall thickening, bilateral distribution, and segmental pattern on CT were more common in MC-CAP patients than in SP-CAP patients (p < 0.01). Sputum Gram stain was highly useful method for the diagnosis in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP (78.4% vs. 89.2%), and penicillins were most frequently chosen as an initial treatment for both pneumonias. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that MC-CAP occurred in older people compared to SP-CAP, influenza virus co-infection was less common in MC-CAP than SP-CAP, and that MC-CAP frequently caused asthma attacks. Gram stain contributed for the appropriate treatment, resulting in conserving broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients."

Despite its prevalence, ABS is often overlooked in young children. The diagnosis and management present unique challenges in primary care. This is an updated narrative review on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of ABS. Methods: A PubMed search was performed using the key term 'acute sinusitis'. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and children. Results: Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the major pathogens in uncomplicated ABS in otherwise healthy children. In complicated ABS, polymicrobial infections are common. The diagnosis of acute sinusitis is mainly clinical and based on stringent criteria, including persistent symptoms and signs of a URI beyond 10 days, without appreciable improvement; a URI with high fever and purulent nasal discharge at onset lasting for at least 3 consecutive days; and biphasic or worsening symptoms. Conclusion: Data from high-quality studies on the management of ABS are limited. The present consensus is that amoxicillin-clavulanate, at a standard dose of 45 mg/kg/day orally, is the drug of choice for most cases of uncomplicated ABS in children in whom antibacterial resistance is not suspected. Alternatively, oral amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day can be administered. For those with severe ABS or uncomplicated acute sinusitis who are at risk for severe disease or antibiotic resistance, oral high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day) is the drug of choice."

Ordinarily sterile sites were the source of 233 isolates. Moraxella nonliquefaciens, the most common isolate (356 strains), was recovered from upper respiratory or ocular sites in 208 (58%) of the cases. Moraxella osloensis was next most common (199 strains) but was the most frequent blood isolate (44 cases). K. kingae appeared especially invasive, with 58 of 78 isolates from blood, bone, or joint. Of the K. kingae strains, 75% were recovered from children under 6 years, compared with 23% of the other strains from that age group (P less than .01). Of the 74 isolates of group M-5, 53 were from wounds caused by dog bites; no other organism in this series was recovered from such wounds. Sixteen of the 28 M. urethralis isolates were from urine. Cases occurred as single infections, with no evidence of clusters. Of patients with infection of ordinarily sterile sites, 9.3% died; only bacteremia, meningitis, and empyema caused fatalities. Most referring laboratories (98%) had not identified the organisms to species, and only 30% had identified them to correct genus. Susceptibility testing by broth dilution revealed low MICs of penicillin (mean, 0.3; 64% less than 1 micrograms/mL). Moraxella, M. urethralis, M-5, M-6, and Kingella are important but frequently misidentified pathogens for humans; penicillin appears to be the treatment of choice."

Moraxella species normally exist as part of the human upper respiratory tract flora and rarely cause invasive human disease. There are only a handful of case reports implicating the organism as a cause of endocarditis, bacteraemia, septic arthritis and endophthalmitis. Identification to the species level based on routine laboratory techniques has been challenging, with final identification often made through 16S rRNA sequencing. With the use of a newer diagnostic tool, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, we were able to rapidly identify the organism and initiate appropriate treatment. Case presentation. We present a rare care of M. nonliquefaciens meningitis in a paediatric patient with an underlying cranial anatomical defect due to Crouzon syndrome. She had been admitted to hospital 3 months previously with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and mastoiditis, and returned to the emergency department with meningismus. CSF culture grew M. nonliquefaciens. She was treated with ceftriaxone with rapid improvement and eventually was taken for endoscopic surgical repair of a right encephalocele defect. Conclusion. The use of MALDI-TOF MS allowed for the rapid identification of the organism. The patient recovered with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and eventual surgical correction. An underlying anatomical defect should be considered in all patients who present with meningitis due to this unusual organism."

Although very rare, bloodstream infections caused by this organism have been described, showing often a fatal outcome. Here, we report the case of a pediatric cancer patient with bloodstream infection and sepsis due to M. nonliquefaciens showing full recovery after appropriate antibiotic treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A three-year-old boy with stage IV neuroblastoma was admitted for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue after standard neuroblastoma treatment. Despite receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, acyclovir and amphothericin B, the patient presented with fever of up to 39.5  C and neutropenia. Besides a chemotherapy-related mucositis and an indwelling Broviac catheter (removed), no infection focus was identified on physical examination. Moraxella nonliquafaciens was identified in blood cultures. After antibiotic treatment and neutrophil recovery, the patient was fit for discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The case described highlights the importance of an otherwise non-pathogenic microorganism, especially in immunosupressed cancer patients. It should be kept in mind that, although very infrequently, Moraxella nonliquefaciens may cause bloodstream infections that can be successfully treated with prompt focus identification and antibiotic therapy."

A significantly higher frequency of beta-lactamase production was recorded in M. nonliquefaciens isolated in the municipality with the higher prescription rate. A corresponding difference was not recorded for H. influenzae or B. catarrhalis. Approximately 75% of the nasopharyngeal pathogens H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as the commensal M. nonliquefaciens, were eliminated and often replaced by other strains of either species over a period of one month. Although none of the children were on antibiotics a substantial proportion of the acquired strains produced beta-lactamase. This suggested that the carrier rate of beta-lactamase producing strains of the respiratory tract is not only related to the effect of recent antibiotic treatment but also to the prevalence of such strains in the population."

The aim of this study was to determine whether nasal and/or oropharyngeal microbiota profiles are associated with age and RTIs. METHODS: Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs of 152 controls and 152 patients with an RTI were included. The latter group consisted of 72 patients with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and 80 with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were subjected to microbiota profiling using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Moraxella species were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and culture. RESULTS: Based on the microbiota profiles of the controls and the patients with an RTI, eight nasal and nine oropharyngeal microbiota clusters were defined. Nasal microbiota dominated by either Moraxella catarrhalis or Moraxella nonliquefaciens was significantly more prevalent in elderly compared to mid-aged adults in the control group (p = 0.002). Dominance by M. catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens was significantly less prevalent in elderly with an LRTI (p = 0.001) compared to controls with similar age.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients admitted to the ICU of a 677-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital in Belgium during 1997-2002. METHODS: ICU-acquired pneumonia was defined as a case of pneumonia that occurred 2 days or more after admission to the ICU in combination with a positive results of radiologic analysis, clinical signs and symptoms, and a positive culture result. All cases of pneumonia were categorized as either early onset (within 7 days after admission) and late onset (7 days or more after admission), with or without previous antibiotic treatment, and the corresponding pathogens were analyzed. Risk factors for the isolation of pathogens potentially resistant to multiple drugs (ie, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter species, Acinetobacter species, Burkholderia species, extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producing pathogens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 4,200 patients stayed at the ICU for 2 or more days, 298 of whom developed ICU-acquired pneumonia, for an overall incidence of 13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 11-14 cases) per 1,000 ICU-days. Pathogens potentially resistant to multiple drugs were isolated from 52% of patients with early-onset pneumonia. Risk factors for the isolation of these pathogens were greater age and previous receipt of antibiotic prophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.6 [95% CI, 1.6-13.0]) or antibiotic therapy (aOR, 8.2 [95% CI, 2.8-23.8]). The length of ICU admission and hospital stay were weaker risk factors for the isolation of these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens potentially resistant to multiple drugs were isolated in 52% of cases of early-onset ICU-acquired pneumonia. Previous antibiotic use (both prophylactic and therapeutic) is the main risk factor for the isolation of these pathogens."

Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from &lt; or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time."

This study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the University of Queensland's School of Veterinary Science for postmortem examination. Thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. The most abundant bacteria included Aeromonas spp., Clostridium spp., Vibrio spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas spp. In six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. Mixed infections containing Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp.; Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, and Serratia marcescens; and Actinomyces spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and Enterococcus faecalis was associated with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. Clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. The significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. It is also difficult to fulfil Koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. Regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty different samples were collected from patients with chronic surgical site infections, laparoscopic port site infections, anal fistula, mesh hernioplasty, chronic dacryocystitis, chronic osteomyelitis, and chronic burn wounds. Samples were processed for culture, identification, antibiotic sensitivity testing using standard microbiological techniques. Biofilm (BF) forming capacity for aerobic organisms were tested by tissue culture plate method. Those for anaerobes and atypical mycobacteria were studied by a novel method using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In vivo BF colonization in lacrimal mucosae of chronic dacryocystitis, patients were studied from histopathological sections by Gram staining, H and E, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: Out of fifty different samples, sixty-three isolates were obtained in pure culture as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (25.39%), Escherichia coli (14.28%), Klebsiella pneumonia (14.28%), Mycobacterium abscessus (12.69%), Citrobacter spp. (9.52%), Bacteroides fragilis (6.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.7%), Proteus spp. (4.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.1%), Enterobacter spp. (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.5%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (1.5%). Among the isolates, 74% were found to be BF producers in the following frequency: P. aeruginosa 100%, S. epidermidis 100%, B. fragilis 100%, Klebsiella spp. 88.88%, S. aureus 81.25%, M. abscessus 75%, Citrobacter spp. 83.33%, Proteus spp. 66.66%, E. coli spp. 33.33%, and Enterobacter spp. 0%. CONCLUSION: AFM has been proven to be a useful method for detection of in vitro grown BF including those for anaerobes and atypical Mycobacteria. In vivo BF detection becomes possible by FISH. S. aureus was the most common isolate. Among the aerobic isolates, P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis were found to be the most common BF producers. Atypical mycobacteria were also found to be BF producers. Diagnosis of BF s in chronic infections significantly changes the management strategy as these infections can no longer be dealt simply with antibiotics alone but require mechanical removal of the foci along with antibiotic coverage for complete cure."

Pathological examination revealed fibrinous bronchopneumonia with prominent areas of necrosis (sequestra) and numerous Gram-negative bacilli within alveoli and in blood vessels of the lungs and liver and between muscle fibers. The cause of death was attributed to septicemia. Often, cases of fibrinous bronchopneumonia are characterized by bacteremia in the latter stages of infection, resulting in the death of the animal. Septicemia likely accounts for the ecchymoses and petechiae noted on the spleen, pancreas, forestomach, lungs, visceral peritoneum, and small intestine.

Our aim in this study was to determine the incidence, microorganisms involved, associated factors, and morbidity of bacterial pneumonia presenting in the first 100 days posttransplant. METHODS: We performed a cohort study in which patients receiving liver transplantation were included prospectively in our national database (Database of Infections in Transplantation of Solid Organs). The study period was from July 14, 2009 to July 24, 2015. RESULTS: One hundred six patients were transplanted during the 6-year period. We documented 9 bacterial pneumonia cases with an incidence of 8.5 per 100 patients; 2 patients had hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and 7 had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In 4 of the 9 bacterial pneumonia cases, patients presented with bacteremia. Eleven microorganisms were isolated these 9 patients. Microbiologic diagnosis methods included 5 cases of alveolar bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 1 case of BAL and pleural fluid puncture, 1 case of pleural fluid puncture, and 1 case through sputum study. Of the 11 isolated organisms, 9 corresponded to Gram-negative bacilli (GNB): Klebsiella spp, n = 3; Acinetobacter baumannii, n = 4; Morganella morganii, n = 1; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, n = 1. Regarding the resistance profile, 7 presented with a multiresistance profile (MDR) and extreme resistance (XDR). Univariate analysis identified the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) pretransplant score as a factor associated with developing pneumonia (P &lt; .001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.872-10.167), and early extubation, before 8 hours posttransplant, as a protective factor (P = .008; relative risk [RR] 0.124; 95% CI 0 .041-0.377). Hospital stay was longer in patients with pneumonia compared to those without pneumonia (P &lt; .0001, 95% CI 17.79-43.11 days). There was also an increased risk of death in patients with pneumonia (RR 17.963; 95% CI 5106-63,195). CONCLUSIONS: Early bacterial pneumonia after hepatic transplantation is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. At our center, 4 of 9 patients had bacteremia. GNB cases with MDR and XDR profiles are predominant. Early extubation is a protective factor."

METHODS: The samples of urethral exudates, prostatic secretions or/and semen were collected from 8 cases of male patients with acute urethritis or chronic prostatitis, then inoculated into gonococcal agar medium, blood agar medium, Sabouraud agar medium and Mycoplasma agar medium, respectively. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasmae, fungi and other bacteria were isolated, Chlamydiae examined by Gemenez staining, and the gram-negative diplococci from the samples identified by oxidase test, biochemical examination and drug sensitivity test. The PCR products of the cryptic plasmid pJD1 gene of the isolated strains were amplified for the identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Based on the results of drug sensitivity tests, intravenous or oral antibiotics were selected for treatment. RESULTS: Eight strains of gram-negative diplococci were isolated in this study, 3 identified as N. mucosa, 4 as N. cinerea and the other 1 as N. lactamica. The PCR identification test of the cryptic plasmid pJD1 gene showed the same positive results in all the strains as in N. gonorrhoeae. The non-gonococcal Neisseria isolated from the male genital tract secretions exhibited a multidrug resistance, especially to quinolones and fosfomycin. All the symptoms disappeared and no pathogens were detected in the patients after a 7-day treatment with Cephalosporins or/and Minocycline. CONCLUSION: Some Neisseria species normally parasitizing the upper respiratory tract can also cause male genitourinary infections, such as gonorrhea-like urethritis and chronic prostatitis. Neisseria gonorrhea could be clinically and etiologically misdiagnosed through such conventional methods as morphological examination, oxidase test and PCR identification test of cryptic plasmid and other nonspecific genes. Intravenous and/or oral antibiotic medication based on the results of drug sensitivity tests can cure acute urethritis and chronic prostatitis induced by non-gonococcal Neisseria in males. Drug resistance of non-gonococcal Neisseria directly affects the success of treatment."

","SPECIES:Neisseria cinereaID:2121328TITLE:Branhamella catarrhalis: an organism gaining respect as a pathogen.ABSTRACT:Branhamella catarrhalis was formerly regarded as a common, essentially harmless inhabitant of the pharynx. This misapprehension was caused, in part, by confusion with another pharyngeal resident, Neisseria cinerea. The two organisms can now be differentiated by the positive reactions of B. catarrhalis in tests for nitrate reduction and hydrolysis of tributyrin and DNase. B. catarrhalis is currently recognized as the third most frequent cause of acute otitis media and acute sinusitis in young children. It often causes acute exacerbations of chronic bronchopulmonary disease in older or immunocompromised adults and is incriminated occasionally in meningitis, endocarditis, bacteremia, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and urogenital infections. Virulence-associated factors, such as pili, capsules, outer membrane vesicles, iron acquisition proteins, histamine-synthesizing ability, resistance to the bactericidal action of normal human serum, and binding to the C1q complement component, have been identified in some strains. beta-Lactamase producing strains, first detected in 1976, have risen to approximately 75% worldwide. Thus far, however, practically all American strains of B. catarrhalis remain susceptible to alternative antibiotics. A possible selective advantage of recent isolates is their reportedly heightened tendency for adherence to oropharyngeal cells from patients with chronic bronchopulmonary disease."

Approximately 2% of all respiratory tract specimens examined during the period yielded growth of B. catarrhalis. All except one patient suffered from chronic pulmonary disease, notably chronic bronchitis. A phenotypic comparison was made between 55 strains of B. catarrhalis, of which 50 were recent isolates from lower respiratory tract specimens, and 23 Neisseria strains representing Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria mucosa, Neisseria pharyngis, and Neisseria lactamica. The morphology of B. catarrhalis colonies is very characteristic, and when the diagnosis is suspected, testing for the ability to hydrolyze tributyrin may confirm it within hours. Ability to produce deoxyribonuclease is another property which differentiates B. catarrhalis from the Neisseria species. Otherwise, the combination of nitrate reduction and failure to produce acid from glucose, maltose, and sucrose establishes the diagnosis."

METHODS: Between March, 1991, and April, 1993, children aged &lt;3 months were recruited at the outpatient department of Goroka Base Hospital, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Children with pre-defined inclusion criteria were enrolled, a history was taken and clinical examination was performed. Blood and urine were collected from children with signs suggestive of severe disease together with eye, umbilical and pernasal swabs as appropriate. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children with and without signs of severe disease for identification of viruses and Chlamydia trachomatis by direct fluorescent antibody staining. RESULTS: 3280 infants were triaged and 2168 enrolled, among whom 968 had signs suggestive of severe disease. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus were the most important bacterial pathogens isolated from children &lt; 1 month old with severe infections, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were most important in older children. Of 292 eye swabs 19 (7%) grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Of 116 umbilical swabs 51 (44%) grew S. pyogenes and 45 (39%) grew Staphylococcus aureus. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most important viral cause of acute lower respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are important causes of severe infection in young children in the PNG highlands. It is necessary to improve access to clean water, promote hand-washing in the hospital and at home and investigate further the use of maternal immunization for the prevention of severe disease in young infants."

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of 182 patients managed expectantly over a 3-year period was done. Thirty-four patients had cervical cultures positive for group B streptococcus, 11 had positive cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and 137 had negative cultures. Prophylactic antibiotics were routinely given, and antibiotic therapy was continued in patients with positive cultures. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups in latent phase or maternal morbidity. The incidence of neonatal pneumonia was increased in those with positive cervical cultures (p = 0.009, odds ratio 6.9, 90% confidence interval 2.1 to 22.8), but there was no difference in neonatal sepsis, respiratory distress, or neonatal mortality.

When to investigate and when to prescribe.ABSTRACT:Sore throats are most commonly due to infections, many of which are viral and do not require specific treatment. Symptoms and signs of the common cold, influenza or croup, the occurrence of conjunctivitis in some adenoviral infections, generalised lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in glandular fever or the presence of vesicles characteristic of herpangina (Coxsackie A virus) or of herpes simplex infection, occasionally enable a clinical diagnosis and avoid the need for antibiotic therapy. In the case of treatable conditions a typical membrane may suggest diphtheria, a scarlatiniform rash infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes or to Corynebacterium haemolyticum, and a cherry-red epiglottis Haemophilus influenzae type b. Associated atypical pneumonia suggests infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae. Pharyngitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae may be accompanied by infection at other sites or by other sexually transmitted diseases. Candidal infection, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, should suggest HIV infection. Surgical drainage is required in the case of peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. Noninfectious cases of sore throat, e.g. thyroiditis, are relatively uncommon considerations in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile pharyngitis. The most common problem is to recognise streptococcal pharyngitis, which requires antibiotic treatment for 10 days to avoid the risk of rheumatic fever."

This article outlines the spectrum of B. catarrhalis disease in childhood and the extent of the evidence for a pathogenic role of the organism. B. catarrhalis is a rare etiologic agent in septicemia, meningitis, and other systemic illness in both apparently normal and immunocompromised infants and children. It is an unusual cause of ophthalmia neonatorum, but can be confused with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Whether or not B. catarrhalis is acquired from the birth canal in these cases has not been established. B. catarrhalis is most common as a respiratory tract pathogen in children, including pneumonia, bacterial tracheitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. Since it is difficult to rigorously document pathogenicity of any bacterium in bronchopulmonary infections in children, it is probable that the spectrum of B. catarrhalis disease is wider than that reported to date. The evidence for pathogenicity in acute otitis media is more extensive than for other infections. Otitis media due to B. catarrhalis is clinically similar to that due to other pathogens. B. catarrhalis can be isolated in pure culture from the middle ear exudate and persists if there is no antibacterial treatment. Gram-negative intracellular and extracellular diplococci can be seen on smears of the inflammatory exudate. There is preliminary evidence that there is an antibody response in B. catarrhalis otitis media. B. catarrhalis has emerged as an important and common pathogen in neonates, infants, and children."

We clinically examined respiratory tract infections from which non-pathogenic Neisseria species were isolated by transtracheal aspiration (TTA). The incidence of non-pathogenic Neisseria isolated was 54 (15.7%) out of 344 episodes of respiratory tract infections with isolated microorganisms from TTA, and was 17.6%, 15.8%, 14.3% for pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and chronic lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. All 54 episodes were isolated with other microorganisms such as alpha-Streptococcus spp. (75.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (25.9%) and anaerobics (22.2%). The isolation ratio according to the age group increased at 45 years of age or more, but did not increase with the advance of age. Predisposing factors were identified such as overt aspiration, iatrogenic procedure and heavy smoking. Cases without overt aspiration that had fevers of 38 degrees C or more or hypoxemia of less than PaO2 70 torr when detecting non-pathogenic Neisseria were observed more frequently in the aged than the non-aged. The findings suggest the detection of non-pathogenic Neisseria by TTA is influenced by the host state that the fall of microorganisms from the upper to lower respiratory tract cannot be defended or excluded by mucociliary transportation disorder due to underlying disease and smoking, or deterioration of physical status other than overt or silent aspiration."

METHODS: The samples of urethral exudates, prostatic secretions or/and semen were collected from 8 cases of male patients with acute urethritis or chronic prostatitis, then inoculated into gonococcal agar medium, blood agar medium, Sabouraud agar medium and Mycoplasma agar medium, respectively. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasmae, fungi and other bacteria were isolated, Chlamydiae examined by Gemenez staining, and the gram-negative diplococci from the samples identified by oxidase test, biochemical examination and drug sensitivity test. The PCR products of the cryptic plasmid pJD1 gene of the isolated strains were amplified for the identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

RESULTS: Eight strains of gram-negative diplococci were isolated in this study, 3 identified as N. mucosa, 4 as N. cinerea and the other 1 as N. lactamica. The PCR identification test of the cryptic plasmid pJD1 gene showed the same positive results in all the strains as in N. gonorrhoeae.

Colonization is a prerequisite for invasive meningococcal disease. However, no study in Japan has involved specifically analyzing the carriage rate of Neisseria meningitidis in children. During 5 months in 2015, the respiratory tract specimens of patients who presented to 3 hospitals with respiratory symptoms were cultured. The bacteria were identified in selective media using a meningococcal detection kit and the serogroup was identified using polymerase chain reaction analysis. In 389 patients aged &lt;=15 years with respiratory symptoms, the N. meningitidis isolation rate was 0.26% (1/389). The serogroup of the only child who tested positive was Y. In this study, we detected a low meningococcal isolation rate in pediatric patients. Due to increasing globalization, the risk of invasive meningococcal disease is likely increasing in Japan. Accordingly, invasive meningococcal diseases should be continuously monitored in Japan. Future large-scale studies should assess meningococcal isolation rates and corresponding serogroups."

","SPECIES:Neisseria lactamicaID:32873462TITLE:Bacteriological analysis of Neisseria lactamica isolated from the respiratory tract in Japanese children.ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Neisseria lactamica is a commensal bacterium of the upper respiratory tract in humans and is closely related to Neisseria meningitidis. N. lactamica colonization may contribute to preventing N. meningitidis colonization and invasive meningococcal disease. However, the transference of antimicrobial resistance genes from N. lactamica to N. meningitidis has been reported. METHODS: In this study, we aimed to identify N. lactamica using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and performed multilocus sequence typing of seven N. lactamica strains isolated from Japanese children. We also analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility of these strains and the mutations in their antimicrobial resistance genes (penA, gyrA, and parC). RESULTS: All the N. lactamica strains could be identified using MALDI-TOF MS. All strains were of different sequence types (STs), including five new STs. Five strains had intermediate susceptibility, two were resistant to ampicillin, and all had five out of the five known PBP2 mutations. Six strains were resistant to levofloxacin. Among the quinolone-resistant strains, three had GyrA mutations, and three had both ParC and GyrA mutations. CONCLUSIONS: N. lactamica STs may vary in Japanese children, and penicillin- and quinolone-resistant strains may be prevalent. We should pay attention not only to the drug resistance of N. meningitidis but also to the drug susceptibility of N. lactamica whose drug-resistance genes may transfer to N. meningitidis."

DESIGN: Prospective observational case study. SETTING: Emergency Department of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, between May 1996 and May 1997. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 3-36 months presenting to the Emergency Department with temperature &gt; or = 39 degrees C and without specific viral illnesses (varicella, croup or herpes gingivostomatitis). OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteraemia (defined as presence of pathogenic bacteria in a blood culture), white blood cell count (WCC), McCarthy score, and final diagnosis based on clinical features and investigations. RESULTS: Bacteraemia was identified in 18 of 534 patients (3.4%). Pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Neisseria meningitidis (2) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). Increased WCC counts (P &lt; 0.001) and brief duration of fever (P &lt; 0.001) were associated with bacteraemia. Nevertheless, clinical features, including McCarthy scores, and high WCC counts (&gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/L) had &lt; 10% predictive accuracy for bacteraemia. Overall, final diagnoses in the 534 febrile children included non-specific viral infections (25%), upper respiratory tract infections (24%), otitis media (10%), gastroenteritis (9%), pneumonia (7%), and urinary tract infection (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Most urban Australian children aged 3-36 months presenting to a paediatric emergency department with temperature &gt; or = 39 degrees C without a clinical focus have a viral infection. However, 3%-4% have occult bacteraemia. Neither clinical features nor high WCC counts reliably identify these patients. As empiric antibiotics may contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance and have not been shown to prevent the rare complication of meningitis, we believe that close contact and regular review of these patients is preferable to empiric antibiotic therapy."

Infections of the respiratory tract with N meningitidis have been documented in the past, but often this organism is not routinely considered in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia. The pathogenic role of N meningitidis in lower respiratory tract infections may be underestimated because its isolation is difficult, particularly when oropharyngeal flora are present.

The aim of this study was to determine the relative contributions of different etiologic agents to CAP in children. METHODS: This was a 6-month prospective study of pediatric accident and emergency and general practice consultations with a diagnosis of CAP. Nasopharyngeal aspirates for viral immunofluorescence and PCR studies and blood cultures for bacterial studies were taken from 51 children with symptoms, signs and chest radiographic features that satisfied a diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: An etiologic agent was isolated from 25 patients (49%). A viral cause was identified in 22 patients (43%), and influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were detected in 16 and 18% of all cases, respectively. Only four patients (8%) had a positive bacterial blood culture; three had Streptococcus pneumoniae and one had Neisseria meningitidis W135. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 2 children, and mixed infections were detected in 5 (10%). The use of viral PCR increased the detection rate of influenza A virus by 100%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A virus caused more than one-third of all viral CAP cases, a rate comparable with that of RSV CAP. Viral PCR doubled the diagnostic yield of influenza A virus. The clinical burden of influenza A CAP was comparable with that of RSV CAP, as measured by the duration of fever, hospital stay and total duration of illness."

Although several reports have described unusual meningococcal diseases, the Neisseria meningitidis strains involved in these forms have been poorly characterized. In this study, meningococcal arthritis and pericarditis were confirmed by isolation of N. meningitidis and/or detection of meningococcal DNA in synovial or pericardial fluid, respectively, and meningococcal pneumonia was detected by isolation of N. meningitidis from blood. From 1999 through 2002, meningococcal disease was bacteriologically confirmed in 26 cases of arthritis, 6 cases of pericarditis, and 33 cases of pneumonia by the National Reference Center for the Meningococci in Paris. We found a statistically significant association between strains of serogroup W135, mostly of the clonal complex ET-37, and arthritis. Pneumonia was most frequently diagnosed in patients aged &gt;70 years, and 54.5% of the strains belonged to serogroup W135, although these strains had heterogeneous phenotypes.

Uniform penicillin susceptibility has been assumed for meningococcal infections for many years, but decreased penicillin susceptibility has been recognized recently with increasing frequency. Breakpoints to define different categories of susceptibility were published recently by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. We report the case of a teenage girl with sepsis and extensive bilateral pneumonia with empyema caused by an N meningitidis isolate that was resistant to penicillin. Her protracted clinical course suggested that penicillin resistance contributed to her delayed recovery. Our experience with this patient suggests that susceptibility testing should be performed in every case of N meningitidis isolation, and treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin should be provided until the susceptibility results are known. Clinical suspicion of N meningitidis as a possible cause of respiratory symptoms accompanied by hypotension, even in the absence of a rash, may aid in diagnosis and therefore in the treatment and provision of prophylaxis to contacts of patients with meningococcal disease."

On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged &gt;or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality.

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was a prospective nationwide observational cohort study including patients aged &gt;16 years who had bacterial meningitis confirmed by culture of cerebrospinal fluid (696 episodes of bacterial meningitis occurring in 671 patients). Alcoholism was present in 27 of 686 recorded episodes of bacterial meningitis (4%) and alcoholics were more often male than non-alcoholics (82% vs 48%, P = 0.001). A higher proportion of alcoholics had underlying pneumonia (41% vs 11% P&lt;0.001). Alcoholics were more likely to have meningitis due to infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (70% vs 50%, P = 0.01) and Listeria monocytogenes (19% vs 4%, P = 0.005), whereas Neisseria meningitidis was more common in non-alcoholic patients (39% vs 4%, P = 0.01).

Nepal is one of many resource-poor nations with limited information on the epidemiology of childhood infections caused by these pathogens. METHODS: Over a 21-month period, we studied children aged &lt;=12 years admitted to an urban hospital in Nepal with suspected bacteremia, meningitis, or pneumonia. Patan Hospital is a non-profit hospital with the second largest pediatric unit in the Kathmandu Valley. RESULTS: Of 2039 children enrolled in the study, 142 (7.5%) included in the analysis had positive blood cultures. The agents of enteric fever, Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, accounted for 59/142 (42%) of all bacteremias and were the most frequently cultured pathogens in children &gt;=1 year of age. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 16% of positive blood cultures and was the most common cause of bacteremia in children &lt;1 year of age. Pneumonia accounted for 51% of admissions in children &gt;=2 months, with 44% of these children having radiographically defined primary endpoint pneumonia. S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified pathogen in cases of pneumonia and meningitis. The S. pneumoniae serotype distribution indicated that the 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines would cover 44% and 47%, respectively, of all S. pneumoniae cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolates and 62% and 67%, respectively, of isolates associated with pneumonia. H. influenzae type b was isolated infrequently from blood or CSF cultures, but is likely to be more important as a cause of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The data on the burden of invasive bacterial infections and pneumonia from this study suggest that vaccines in development against Salmonella Typhi and the pneumococcus have the potential to significantly improve the health of children in Nepal."

Although several PCR methods have been described for these bacteria the specificity is an underestimated problem. Here we present a quantitative multiplex real-time PCR (qmPCR) for detection of S. pneumoniae (9802 gene fragment), H. influenzae (omp P6 gene) and N. meningitidis (ctrA gene). The method was evaluated on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 156 adults with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and 31 controls, and on 87 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from meningitis patients. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity was not affected by using a combined mixture of reagents and a combined DNA standard (S. pneumoniae/H. influenzae/N. meningitidis) in single tubes. By blood- and BAL-culture and S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were aetiological agents in 21 and 31 of the LTRI patients, respectively. These pathogens were identified by qmPCR in 52 and 72 of the cases, respectively, yielding sensitivities and specificities of 95% and 75% for S. pneumoniae, and 90% and 65% for H. influenzae, respectively. When using a cut-off of 105 genome copies/mL for clinical positivity the sensitivities and specificities were 90% and 80% for S. pneumoniae, and 81% and 85% for H. influenzae, respectively. Of 44 culture negative but qmPCR positive for H. influenzae, 41 were confirmed by fucK PCR as H. influenzae. Of the 103 patients who had taken antibiotics prior to sampling, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were identified by culture in 6% and 20% of the cases, respectively, and by the qmPCR in 36% and 53% of the cases, respectively.In 87 CSF samples S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis were identified by culture and/or 16 S rRNA in 14 and 10 samples and by qmPCR in 14 and 10 samples, respectively, giving a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% for both bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The PCR provides increased sensitivity and the multiplex format facilitates diagnosis of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis and the assay enable detection after antibiotic treatment has been installed.

Five cases were bronchopneumonia (two cases), acute bronchitis (two cases) and diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) (one case).

There was a case in which only N. meningitidis was cultured from specimens obtained by TTA, although another different organism, in addition to N. meningitidis, was recovered from the patient of other cases. Other organisms found together with N. miningitidis were H. influenzae (2 cases), S. dysgalactiae (1 case) and M. tuberculosis (1 case). Predisposing factors were common cold in the female patient and bronchoscopic examination in the cases of lung cancer and of interstitial pneumonia. Two of the five cases occurred consecutively in the same room and so they were considered as nosocomial infections. With these findings, it can be posturated that N. meningitidis might be one of the etiological agents of the respiratory infections."

We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children."

Incidence rates were compared using the rate ratio (RR) and 95% CI were calculated. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of the 6,661 cases, 6,012 were IPD, 436 IMD and 213 IHiD. The global annual incidence per 10 ( 5) inhabitants was 16.62 (95% CI 16.20-17.04) for IPD, 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.32) for IMD and 0.59 (95% CI 0.51-0.67) for IHiD. IPD increased in 2009 compared with 2005 (RR:1.55, 95%CI: 1.43-1.70) and IMD and IHiD remained stable. Pneumonia was the most-frequent clinical manifestation of IPD (75.6%) and IHiD (44.1%) and meningoencephalitis with or without sepsis for IMD (70.6%). The male:female ratio was 1.37 for IPD, 1.0 for IMD and 1.15 for IHiD. The age groups with the highest incidence were the &lt;= 2 y and 2-4 y groups for IPD (66.40 and 50.66/100,000 persons-year) and IMD (14.88 and 7.26/100,000 persons-year) and the &lt;= 2 y and &gt;= 65 y groups for IHiD (1.88 and 1.89/100,000 persons-year). The most-frequent serotypes were serotype 1 (19.0%) in IPD and untypeable serotypes (60.8%) in IHiD. Serogroup B (78.3%) was the most frequent in IMD. S. pneumoniae is the most-frequent agent causing invasive disease in Catalonia. The main clinical manifestations were pneumonia in IPD and IHiD and meningitis in IMD. The main causative agent of meningitis was N. meningitidis in people aged &lt; 20 y and S. pneumoniae in people aged &gt;= 20 y.

","SPECIES:Neisseria meningitidisID:23864766TITLE:The causative pathogen determines the inflammatory profile in cerebrospinal fluid and outcome in patients with bacterial meningitis.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The brain's inflammatory response to the infecting pathogen determines the outcome of bacterial meningitis (BM), for example, the associated mortality and the extent of brain injury. The inflammatory cascade is initiated by the presence of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) activating resident immune cells and leading to the influx of blood derived leukocytes. To elucidate the pathomechanisms behind the observed difference in outcome between different pathogens, we compared the inflammatory profile in the CSF of patients with BM caused by Streptococcus pneumonia (n = 14), Neisseria meningitidis (n = 22), and Haemophilus influenza (n = 9). METHODS: CSF inflammatory parameters, including cytokines and chemokines, MMP-9, and nitric oxide synthase activity, were assessed in a cohort of patients with BM from Burkina Faso. RESULTS: Pneumococcal meningitis was associated with significantly higher CSF concentrations of IFN-gamma , MCP-1, and the matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP-) 9. In patients with a fatal outcome, levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-1RA, IL-6, and TGF-alpha were significantly higher. CONCLUSION: The signature of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and the intensity of inflammatory processes in CSF are determined by the bacterial pathogen causing bacterial meningitis with pneumococcal meningitis being associated with a higher case fatality rate than meningitis caused by N. meningitidis or H. influenzae."

METHODS: Public Health England conducts enhanced national surveillance of invasive meningococcal disease in England and Wales. Detailed clinical information was obtained for all laboratory-confirmed MenW cases diagnosed during 3 epidemiologic years (2010-2011 to 2012-2013), alongside whole-genome sequencing analysis of the clinical isolates. RESULTS: The year-on-year increase in invasive MenW disease across all age groups since 2009-2010 was due to rapid endemic expansion of a single clone belonging to the sequence type 11 complex (cc11). In 2013-2014, MenW was responsible for 15% of all invasive meningococcal disease. All but 1 of the recent MenW:cc11 isolates were very closely related, consistent with recent clonal expansion. Clinical follow-up of all 129 MenW cases diagnosed during 2010-2011 to 2012-2013 revealed that most patients were previously healthy (n = 105 [81%]), had not travelled abroad prior to illness and the majority presented with septicemia (n = 63 [49%]), meningitis (n = 16 [12%]) or both (n = 21 [16%]); however, one-quarter had atypical presentations including pneumonia (n = 15 [12%]), septic arthritis (n = 9 [7%]), and epiglottitis/supraglottitis (n = 5 [4%]). Forty-eight (37%) required intensive care and 15 (12%) died. There was no association between infecting strain, clinical disease, or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The recent increase in invasive MenW disease in England and Wales is due to rapid endemic expansion of a single clone belonging to cc11 and is associated with severe disease with unusual clinical presentations. This increase will require careful monitoring in the coming years."

Comprehensive data on the burden of bacteremia and ID in Italy, including data based on molecular techniques, are needed. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multi-centre, hospital-based study (GSK study identifier: 111334) to assess the burden of bacteremia and ID among children less than five years old with a fever of 39  C or greater. Study participation involved a single medical examination, collection of blood for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood culture, and collection of an oropharyngeal swab for colonization analysis by PCR. RESULTS: Between May 2008 and June 2009, 4536 patients were screened, 944 were selected and 920 were enrolled in the study. There were 225 clinical diagnoses of ID, 9.8 % (22) of which were bacteremic. A diagnosis of sepsis was made for 38 cases, 5.3 % (2) of which were bacteremic. Among the 629 non-ID diagnoses, 1.6 % (10) were bacteremic. Among the 34 bacteremic cases, the most common diagnoses were community-acquired pneumonia (15/34), pleural effusion (4/34) and meningitis (4/34). S. pneumoniae was the most frequently detected bacteria among bacteremic cases (29/34) followed by H. influenzae (3/34). Ninety percent (27/30) of bacteremic patients with oropharyngeal swab results were colonized with the studied bacterial pathogens compared to 46.1 % (402/872) of non-bacteremic cases (p &lt; 0.001). PCV7 (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) vaccination was reported for 55.9 % (19/34) of bacteremic cases. S. pneumoniae serotypes were non-vaccine serotypes in children who had been vaccinated. Mean duration of hospitalization was longer for bacteremic cases versus non-bacteremic cases (13.6 versus 5.8 days). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that S. pneumoniae is one of the pathogens frequently responsible for invasive disease."

As genetic disorders, complement deficiencies are often diagnosed in pediatric population. However, complement deficiencies can also be revealed in adults but have been poorly investigated. Herein, we describe a case series of infections revealing complement deficiency in adults to study clinical spectrum and management of complement deficiencies.A nationwide retrospective study was conducted in French university and general hospitals in departments of internal medicine, infectious diseases enrolling patients older than 15 years old who had presented at least one infection leading to a complement deficiency diagnosis.Forty-one patients included between 2002 and 2015 in 19 different departments were enrolled in this study. The male-to-female ratio was 1.3 and the mean age at diagnosis was 28 +- 14 (15-67) years. The main clinical feature was Neisseria meningitidis meningitis 75% (n = 31/41) often involving rare serotype: Y (n = 9) and W 135 (n = 7). The main complement deficiency observed was the common final pathway deficiency 83% (n = 34/41). Half of the cohort displayed severe sepsis or septic shock at diagnosis (n = 22/41) but no patient died. No patient had family history of complement deficiency. The mean follow-up was 1.15 +- 1.95 (0.1-10) years. Half of the patients had already suffered from at least one infection before diagnosis of complement deficiency: meningitis (n = 13), pneumonia (n = 4), fulminans purpura (n = 1), or recurrent otitis (n = 1). Near one-third (n = 10/39) had received prophylactic antibiotics (cotrimoxazole or penicillin) after diagnosis of complement deficiency. The vaccination coverage rate, at the end of the follow-up, for N meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Haemophilius influenzae were, respectively, 90% (n = 33/37), 47% (n = 17/36), and 35% (n = 14/34).This large study emphasizes that complement deficiencies can be revealed in adults by infectious episodes. Most of them were meningococcal infections revealing common final pathway deficiency. To avoid undiagnosis or late diagnosis, adult displaying first episode of N meningitidis infection should be tested for complement deficiency. "

It occurs in between 5% and 15% of all patients with invasive meningococcal disease and is thus the second most common non-systemic end-organ manifestation. To establish the diagnosis requires a high level of clinical awareness - the incidence is therefore very likely underreported and underestimated.

Herein, we report a case of non-invasive meningococcal pneumonia initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia due to Moraxella catarrhalis on the basis of a Gram stain in a 43-year-old woman with asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and schizophrenia. She visited our hospital following a 3-day history of fever, productive cough, and shortness of breath. Since her sputum smear revealed Gram-negative diplococcus and the chest radiograph showed infiltration in the lower right lung field, her initial diagnosis was pneumonia caused by M. catarrhalis. However, the next day, the sputum culture colonies were unlike those of M. catarrhalis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis revealed the pathogen to be N. meningitidis. As a result, we administered the appropriate treatment and ensured adequate infection prevention and control measures including, droplet precautions and prophylaxis provided to close contacts. Secondary infection did not occur. Although meningococcal pneumonia is not common, physicians should consider N. meningitidis when Gram-negative diplococci are observed in respiratory specimens, as N. meningitidis cannot be distinguished from M. catarrhalis with Gram staining alone. Moreover, it is also important to monitor the appearance of the pathogenic colonies and to closely coordinate with laboratory technicians to determine appropriate treatments. In this article, we review the previous case reports of meningococcal pneumonia reported in 1984-2015 in Japan, summarizing the clinical characteristics and comparing previous reviews of the literature."

Medical records of adult (&gt; 18 years) individuals with confirmed diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial meningitis during a 4-year period were retrospectively reviewed. All required data were obtained from patients' medical charts. Available findings about antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated bacteria from CSF and/or blood were also collected. Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Details of medical management including antibiotic regimen, duration, patients' outcome, and possible sequelae of meningitis were recorded. The most commonly isolated microorganism from CSF or blood of patients was Streptococcus pneumonia (33.33%) followed by Neisseria meningitidis (27.78%) and Haemophilus influenza (16.67%). The most common antimicrobial regimen was ceftriaxone plus vancomycin (69.44%) followed by ceftriaxone plus vancomycin plus ampicillin (11.11%). Neurological sequelae of meningitis including cranial nerve palsy, deafness, and hemiparesis were identified in 4 (11.11%), 2 (5.56%), and 1 (2.78%) subjects, respectively. Regarding mortality, only 3 (8.33%) patients died from bacterial meningitis and the remaining 33 individuals discharged from the hospital. In conclusion, findings of the current study demonstrated that the mean incidence of acute bacterial meningitis in a referral infectious diseases ward in Iran was 9 episodes per year. The majority cases of community-acquired acute bacterial meningitis admitted to our center had negative CSF culture and classic triad of meningitis was absent in them. "

We estimated MD incidence and epidemiology in Argentina using hospital-based surveillance. METHODS: Three-year prospective active surveillance in patients &lt;=15 years of age was conducted at 6 pediatric hospital sentinel units (March 2012 to February 2015). RESULTS: Of 184,360 hospitalized patients, 1444 (0.78%) had suspected meningitis or MD. Of these, 268 (19%) presented probable acute bacterial meningitis or MD, 168 (63%) were culture positive and 51 (30%) tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis. Of 100 culture-negative cases, 30 had positive meningococcal polymerase chain reaction. Thirteen patients presented other uncommon MD manifestations, resulting in a total of 94 MD cases and an annual incidence of 5.1/10 hospitalized patients [95% confidence interval (CI): 4-6]. Fifty-four (57%) patients were males, 48% were &lt;1 year of age and the median age was 12.5 months (1 month to 15 years).

Analysis of long term surveillance data is necessary for understanding changes in the disease occurrence. We analyzed five years of surveillance data to describe by person, place and time and to determine trends in meningitis. METHODS: Meningitis surveillance data from Ghana Health Service in the Upper West Region, from 2009 to 2013 were reviewed. Data was obtained from District-Health Information Management System and line list from the Disease Control Unit. Population figures (denominators) and rainfall data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Within the period 980 cases of meningitis were reported in the region, 507(52%) females and 473(48%) males. The mean age of cases was 20.1years and standard deviation 18.8 years with, 77.6 %( 761/980) cases occurring in persons aged under 30 years. Children under five years were 19.3% (190/980). Attack rates ranged from 6.1/100,000 population in the Daffiama-bussei-Issa-district to 47.5/100,000 in Jirapa. Overall case fatality rate of meningitis was 12.2% with 14deaths/100,000 population. Bacterial agents were isolated from 35% (245/702) of CSF. Majority were Streptococcus pneumonia 48.2 % ( 122/258), and N. meningitides Y/W 135 40.3% (102/258).

The district suffered an outbreak of Neisseria meningitides, W (NMW) in 2012 and a mixed outbreak of Streptococcus pneumonia and NMW in early 2016. We investigated the outbreak to identify the source, causative agents, and magnitude and assess health facility preparedness and propose control measures. Design and Setting: We conducted a descriptive study in all sub-districts of Jirapa, between 28th February to 10th April 2016. We reviewed records at health facilities, assessed health facility preparedness, searched for cases, traced contacts of case to administer chemoprophylaxis and collect CSF for laboratory analysis. Data were entered in Microsoft excel cleaned, and exported to stata-13 for analysis by person place and time. Results: A total 233 meningitis cases were reported with mean age of 22.4years and standard deviation 21.6. Males were (57%), females (43%) and 60.8% were less than 19 years. Attack rate of meningitis was 214/100,000 with case fatality rate (CFR) of 12.4% (29/233). Causative agents were NMW (69.5%) and streptococcus pneumonia (27.1%), mainly serotype STN1 and H. influenza (3.4%). The index case had travel history to dollar power, close to Tain District which is the epicentre for the 2016 meningitis outbreak in Ghana. Conclusion: The Jirapa district experienced a mixed outbreak of streptococcal and meningococcal meningitis in early 2016, facilitated by migration. Active surveillance and mass vaccination with multivalent vaccines is required to protect the population. Funding: Ghana Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (GFELTP)."

There have been only about 344 cases reported worldwide from 1906 to 2015. To our knowledge, there have been only 3 cases reported in the USA in the past 2 decades. We present a case of a 72-year-old male with a past medical history of severe COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, and stage I lung cancer status post-stereotactic body radiation therapy 1 year ago, who was admitted with a 6-day history of productive cough with yellowish sputum, shortness of breath, extreme myalgias, and fatigue. Chest X-ray revealed an infiltrative process in the left lower lung field and left-sided pleural effusion. Blood cultures grew beta-lactamase-negative N. meningitidis after 24 hours. Our patient was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which were later switched to amoxicillin to complete a total of 14 days of antibiotics. Diagnosing meningococcal pneumonia requires a high level of suspicion, as sputum cultures may be falsely positive due to asymptomatic carriage of the organism in the upper respiratory tract in up to 10% of outpatient population. We highlight this case as early recognition and treatment is critical. The case fatality rate for N. meningitidis pneumonia has been reported to be higher compared with meningococcal meningitis."

We characterized children admitted with community-acquired sepsis to European PICUs and studied risk factors for mortality and disability. METHODS: Data were collected within the collaborative Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)-funded EUCLIDS study, which is a prospective multicenter cohort study aiming to evaluate genetic determinants of susceptibility and/or severity in sepsis. This report includes 795 children admitted with community-acquired sepsis to 52 PICUs from seven European countries between July 2012 and January 2016. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital death. Secondary outcome measures were PICU-free days censured at day 28, hospital length of stay, and disability. Independent predictors were identified by multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients most commonly presented clinically with sepsis without a source (n = 278, 35%), meningitis/encephalitis (n = 182, 23%), or pneumonia (n = 149, 19%). Of 428 (54%) patients with confirmed bacterial infection, Neisseria meningitidis (n = 131, 31%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 78, 18%) were the main pathogens. Mortality was 6% (51/795), increasing to 10% in the presence of septic shock (45/466). Of the survivors, 31% were discharged with disability, including 24% of previously healthy children who survived with disability. Mortality and disability were independently associated with S. pneumoniae infections (mortality OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-16.0, P = 0.04; disability OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.8-15.8, P &lt; 0.01) and illness severity as measured by Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2) score (mortality OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.1, P &lt; 0.01; disability OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.4, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread immunization campaigns, invasive bacterial disease remains responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in critically ill children in high-income countries. Almost one third of sepsis survivors admitted to the PICU were discharged with some disability. More research is required to delineate the long-term outcome of pediatric sepsis and to identify interventional targets. Our findings emphasize the importance of improved early sepsis-recognition programs to address the high burden of disease."

This study conducted from January to December, 2015 used standard bacteriological and molecular methods to investigate the etiology of three common causes of bacterial meningitis among hospitalized patients admitted at a semi-urban hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: a total of 196 patients admitted at Mama Lucy Kibaki with clinically diagnosed meningitis were recruited into this cross-sectional study. Participants' information was collected through patient interviews and abstraction of health records. Bacterial culture, gram stains and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to investigate causes of bacterial meningitis from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Characteristics such as age, gender, occupation, underlying conditions of patients with laboratory confirmed bacterial meningitis infection are described. Results: among the 196 patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, the median age was 1 year (range 1 to 36 years) with 87.2% aged 1 to 4 years; 54.6% were males. Using PCR, 22 out of 196 (11.2%) samples had evidence suggesting a bacterial infection. These included 12/22 (54.5%) S. pneumonia, 7/22 (31.8%) N. meningitides and 3/22 (13.6%) H. influenza. From bacterial culture, four of 196 (2.1%) samples grew S. pneumonia. All three samples found positive for H. influenza were from male patients aged between 1 to 4 years. Conclusion: of the three common causes evaluated, S. pneumonia was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis among patients from this region, particularly among infants. One older patient was diabetic, thereby highlighting the importance of pre-existing conditions. Although serotyping of bacteria was not done, under-vaccination might have played a role in the cases identified and ensuring complete and timely vaccination may prevent further cases of bacterial meningitis."

We aimed to understand the burden of disease and outcomes in children with life-threatening bacterial infections in Europe. METHODS: The European Union Childhood Life-threatening Infectious Disease Study (EUCLIDS) was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study done in six countries in Europe. Patients aged 1 month to 18 years with sepsis (or suspected sepsis) or severe focal infections, admitted to 98 participating hospitals in the UK, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, Spain, and the Netherlands were prospectively recruited between July 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2015. To assess disease burden and outcomes, we collected demographic and clinical data using a secured web-based platform and obtained microbiological data using locally available clinical diagnostic procedures. FINDINGS: 2844 patients were recruited and included in the analysis. 1512 (53 2%) of 2841 patients were male and median age was 39 1 months (IQR 12 4-93 9). 1229 (43 2%) patients had sepsis and 1615 (56 8%) had severe focal infections. Patients diagnosed with sepsis had a median age of 27 6 months (IQR 9 0-80 2), whereas those diagnosed with severe focal infections had a median age of 46 5 months (15 8-100 4; p&lt;0 0001). Of 2844 patients in the entire cohort, the main clinical syndromes were pneumonia (511 [18 0%] patients), CNS infection (469 [16 5%]), and skin and soft tissue infection (247 [8 7%]). The causal microorganism was identified in 1359 (47 8%) children, with the most prevalent ones being Neisseria meningitidis (in 259 [9 1%] patients), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (in 222 [7 8%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 219 [7 7%]), and group A streptococcus (in 162 [5 7%]). 1070 (37 6%) patients required admission to a paediatric intensive care unit. Of 2469 patients with outcome data, 57 (2 2%) deaths occurred: seven were in patients with severe focal infections and 50 in those with sepsis. INTERPRETATION: Mortality in children admitted to hospital for sepsis or severe focal infections is low in Europe. The disease burden is mainly in children younger than 5 years and is largely due to vaccine-preventable meningococcal and pneumococcal infections. Despite the availability and application of clinical procedures for microbiological diagnosis, the causative organism remained unidentified in approximately 50% of patients.

To best describe the trends of BM disease, meningitis surveillance data from the Centre de Recherche Medicale et Sanitaire (CERMES) and the Direction of Surveillance and Response to Epidemics (DSRE) were reviewed and analyzed. Methods: Data on number of notified cases of BM and on pathogens were analyzed during 2003-2015. Excel 2013 was used for trend analysis on the etiology of BM prevalence and incidence. Results: A total of 10051 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected were confirmed by laboratory methods. The main etiologies of meningitis detected were N. meningitidis (82.1%), S. pneumonia (12.1%) and H. influenza (3.4%). N. meningitidis mostly affected children in the age groups of 5-9 years (32.9%) and 10-14 years (24.9%) with respective mean incidence of 14.9 and 11.3. The percentage estimate of N. meningitidis serogroup A (NmA) meningitis fell to 0% in 2015 while during the same year that of N. meningitidis serogroup C (NmC) and N. meningitidis serogroup W (NmW) reached 82.9% and 17% respectively. Conclusion: Overall, the epidemiological trends of the BM in Niger were dynamic. The emergence of NmC strains suggests that there may be an urgent need for serogroup C containing vaccines in Niger in the coming years."

Differing from Neisseria meningitidis (the second most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis), contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis are not required. At postmortem, the differentiation between S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis is traditionally done by culture and polymerase chain reaction performed on blood or cerebrospinal fluid, but may take hours, if not days, to analyze. We present a death from bacterial meningitis in a 73-year-old woman in which a rapid urinary pneumococcal antigen testing was able to identify S. pneumoniae as the causative organism within 1 hour. This was confirmed by subsequent brain swab culture. The rapid urinary pneumococcal antigen test in the case prevented the need for contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis. This case highlights the potential use of this test to rapidly identify the culprit organism at postmortem examination when acute bacterial meningitis is detected."

In 15-30% of the IE cases, standard blood cultures remain sterile. We aimed at identifying the causative agent of a blood-culture-negative IE by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). A 54-year old woman diagnosed with community-onset pneumonia by a general practitioner, was admitted with dyspnea, cough and fever. The patient's blood cultures were repeatedly negative. The transesophageal echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography showed an echo density on the left coronary leaflet of the aortic valve and signs suggestive of a ruptured abscess of the mitro-aortic junction. The patient underwent a semi-urgent aortic valve replacement by a mechanical prosthetic valve. We extracted DNA from the surgically-removed fresh valve tissue. The extraction procedure included bacterial/fungal DNA enrichment procedure. Nextera XT library prepared from the valve DNA extract was sequenced (2 x 250) on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Sequence reads were mapped against bacterial genomic sequences, 16S rRNA genes and clade-specific taxonomic markers. Most of the 103,136 sequencing reads classified as bacterial were assigned to Neisseria meningitidis. In line with these data, mapping of reads against clade-specific and 16S rRNA gene markers revealed N. meningitidis as the most represented species. Assembled metagenomic fragments had the best average nucleotide identity (ANI) with N. meningitidis. Comparison of assembled contigs to reference alleles showed that this strain belongs to the ST-41/44 complex. N. meningitidis is commonly associated with meningitis and/or septicemia but should not be neglected as a causative agent of IE, which became exceedingly rare with the introduction of antibiotics. Our data show that WMGS may be used as a diagnostic procedure to strengthen the diagnosis of IE and to obtain draft genomic sequence of the pathogen and typing information."

Methods: We conducted a review of the literature to describe the risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningococcal pneumonia. Results: Meningococcal pneumonia was first described in 1907 and during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic large numbers of cases of meningococcal pneumonia occurred in patients following the initial viral infection. A number of publications, mainly case series or case reports, has subsequently appeared in the literature. Meningococcal pneumonia occurs mainly with serogroups Y, W-135 and B. Risk factors for meningococcal pneumonia have not been well characterised, but appear to include older age, smoking, people living in close contact (e.g. military recruits and students at university), preceding viral and bacterial infections, haematological malignancies, chronic respiratory conditions and various other non-communicable and primary and secondary immunodeficiency diseases. Primary meningococcal pneumonia occurs in 5-10% of patients with meningococcal infection and is indistinguishable clinically from pneumonia caused by other common pathogens. Fever, chills and pleuritic chest pain are the most common symptoms, occurring in &gt; 50% of cases. Productive sputum and dyspnoea are less common. Diagnosis of meningococcal pneumonia may be made by the isolation of the organism in sputum, blood, or normally sterile site cultures, but is likely to underestimate the frequency of meningococcal pneumonia. If validated, PCR-based techniques may be of value for diagnosis in the future. While penicillin was the treatment of choice for meningococcal infection, including pneumonia, prior to 1991, a third generation cephalosporin has been more commonly used thereafter, because of concerns of penicillin resistance. Chemoprophylaxis, using one of a number of antibiotics, has been recommended for close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis, and similar benefits may be seen in contacts of patients with meningococcal pneumonia. Effective vaccines are available for the prevention of infection with certain meningococcal serogroups, but this field is still evolving. Conclusion: Meningococcal pneumonia occurs fairly frequently and should be considered as a possible cause of pneumonia, particularly in patients with specific risk factors."

We compared the clinical picture and disease outcome of IMD-W cases with other serogroups, adjusting for host characteristics. METHODS: We included IMD cases reported from January 2015 to June 2018 in the Netherlands and assessed clinical manifestation and symptoms at disease onset and calculated case fatality rates (CFRs). We used logistic regression to compare clinical manifestations and mortality of IMD-W with IMD caused by meningococci serogroup B, Y, or C, adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 565 IMD cases were reported, of which 204 were IMD-W, 270 IMD-B, 63 IMD-Y, and 26 IMD-C. Most IMD-W isolates belonged to cc11 (93%; 175/188). Compared with other serogroups, IMD-W patients were diagnosed more often with septicemia (46%) or pneumonia (12%) and less often with meningitis (17%, P &lt; .001). IMD-W cases presented more often with respiratory symptoms (45%, P &lt; .001); 16% of IMD-W patients presented with diarrhea without IMD-specific symptoms (P = .061). The CFR for IMD-W was 16% (32/199, P &lt; .001). The differences between IMD-W and other serogroups remained after adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical presentation and severe outcome among IMD-W cases could not be explained by age, gender, and comorbidities. Almost all our IMD-W cases were caused by cc11. More research is needed to identify the bacterial factors involved in clinical presentation and severity of IMD-W cc11."

In a state of septic shock complicated by limb ischemia, surgical interventions are necessary to control the pathological cascade and improve patient outcomes. The objective of this article was to report etiologies and surgical outcomes associated with cutaneous manifestations in adults. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis compared 190 adult patients with etiologies, signs and symptoms, and surgical outcomes associated with cutaneous manifestations of PF. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically and independently searched. Patient and clinical characteristics, surgical interventions, outcomes, and complications were recorded. Results: Seventy-nine studies were eligible for the systematic review, and 77 were eligible for meta-analysis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines. A total of 71/190 (38%) cases reported surgical debridement. Fasciotomies were reported in 12/190 (6%) cases and 20 procedures. Amputations were reported in 154/190 (81%) cases. Reconstruction was reported in 45 cases. Skin grafts were applied in 31 cases. Flaps were used for reconstruction in 28 cases. Median (IQR) surgical procedures per patient were 4 (4, 5) procedures. Infectious organisms causing PF were 32% Neisseria meningitidis (n = 55) and 32% Streptococcus pneumonia (n = 55). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (95% confidence interval (CI)(8.2-177.9), p = 0.032), Haemophilus influenza (95%CI (7.2-133), p = 0.029), Streptococcus pneumonia (95% CI (13.3-75.9), p = 0.006), and West Nile Virus (95%CI (8.2-177.9), p = 0.032) were associated with significantly more extensive amputations compared to other organisms. Conclusion: This systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis found the most common presentation of PF was septic shock from an infectious organism. Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumonia were equally the most common organisms associated with PF. The majority of cases were not treated in a burn center. The most common surgeries were amputations, with below-the-knee-amputations being the most common procedure. Skin grafting was the most commonly performed reconstructive procedure. The most common complications were secondary infections. Organisms with significantly more extensive amputations were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumonia, and West Nile Virus.

Passage of N. meningitidis into the bloodstream can cause invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), a potentially life-threatening illness with rapid onset that generally presents as meningitis, septicemia or both. Serogroup W IMD has been increasing in prevalence in recent years, and observations suggest that it may present with atypical signs and symptoms. Herein, a literature search was performed to identify trends in atypical serogroup W IMD presentation in order to review those that are most prevalent. Findings indicate that the most prevalent atypical presentations of serogroup W IMD include acute gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, septic arthritis and bacteremic pneumonia or severe upper respiratory tract infection, notably epiglottitis. Atypical clinical presentation is associated with higher case fatality rates and can lead to misdiagnoses. Such risks highlight the need for clinicians to consider IMD in their differential diagnoses of patients with acute GI symptoms, septic arthritis or bacteremic pneumonia, primarily in regions where serogroup W is prevalent."

As a measure to control the burden of IBD, the Government of India introduced Pneumoccocal Conjugate Vaccine-13 (PCV-13) in the Universal Immunization Program in high burden districts of five states in a phased manner from 2017 onwards. It is essential to understand the trend of circulating pneumococcal serotypes associated with IBD in the prevaccination and postvaccination scenarios to decide on the expansion of vaccination programmes and PCV reformulation. This manuscript describes the protocol for hospital-based sentinel surveillance for S. pneumoniae and other organisms causing IBD across various geographical regions in India. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Hospital-based surveillance is established in selected hospitals to recruit children aged 1-59 months with symptoms of pneumonia and other IBD. Diagnostic criteria were adapted from standard WHO case definitions. Case Report Forms (CRFs) are used to collect data from the enrolled children. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other normally sterile body fluids are collected and subjected to microscopy, cytology, latex agglutination, biochemistry, bacteriological culture and real-time PCR as applicable. Pneumococcal isolates are serotyped and tested for assessing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Data will be analysed by simple descriptive statistics to estimate the proportion of pneumonia and other IBD due to S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis. Prevalence of bacterial infection, circulating pneumococcal serotypes, antibiotic resistance patterns, serotype variability across seasons and regions will be described in terms of percentage with 95% confidence interval. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The institutional review boards of the coordinating centre, all sentinel sites, regional and national reference laboratories approved the project. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with stakeholders for deciding on revising vaccination strategy appropriately."

We aimed to assess the role of immature neutrophils in peripheral blood smears for prediction of bacteremia in children. Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted in Salvador, Brazil, blood cultures collected from patients aged <=18 years were identified. White Blood Cell count (WBC) was performed upon admission. Medical charts were reviewed and cases from the community were included. Results: Out of 833 potentially eligible patients, 263 (31.6%) were excluded. Therefore, the study group comprised 570 patients being blood collected for culture upon admission from all of them and WBC performed upon admission from 566. The median age was 2 years (IQR: 9.4 mo-5 y) and 300 (52.6%) were male. Acute respiratory infection was the most frequent diagnosis (n = 388; 68.1%), being 250 (43.9%) lower (LRTI) and 138 (24.2%) upper respiratory tract infections. Blood culture was positive in 9 (1.6%; 95% CI: 0.8-2.9%) cases, out of which 7 (2.8%) had LRTI. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3), Haemophilus (n = 2), Neisseria meningitidis, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Acinetobacter baumanii (n = 1 each) were isolated. The total WBC/mm3 did not differ when children with positive or negative blood culture were compared (12,100 [IQR: 6,950-15,250] vs. 11,000 [IQR: 7,900-14,900]; P = 0.9). However, presence of any immature neutrophil was significantly more frequent among patients with bacteremia in comparison with patients without bacteremia (100% [9/9] vs. 40% [223/557]; P < 0.001). The absolute number of immature neutrophils was significantly lower among children without bacteremia (0 [IQR: 0-259] vs. 325 [IQR: 275-1,106]; P < 0.001). Overall, the area under the ROC curve of the number of immature neutrophils in regard to bacteremia was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.88; P = 0.001). Among 413 patients with absolute number of immature neutrophils <242/mm3, none had bacteremia; among 153 patients with absolute number of immature neutrophils >=242/mm3, 9 (5.9%) had bacteremia. Absolute number of immature neutrophils >=242/mm3 showed: sensitivity 100% (95% CI: 71.7-100%), specificity 74.1% (95% CI: 70.4-77.7%), negative predictive value 100% (95% CI: 99.3-100.0%), and positive predictive value 5.9% (95% CI: 2.9-10.5%). When only children with LRTI were analyzed, the results were similar. Conclusion: The absolute number of immature neutrophils in peripheral blood smear is a potential tool to rule out bacteremia among children with community-acquired infections."

The second most common and potentially severe end-organ manifestation of invasive meningococcal disease is meningococcal pneumonia. It occurs between 5 % and 15 % of all patients with invasive meningococcal disease. N. meningitidis sepsis and meningitis continue to be associated with high morbidity and mortality, however, meningococcal pneumonia is uncommon and often underreported. We describe a case of sepsis secondary to pneumonia with N. meningitidis bacteremia, without any evidence of meningitis. This case reports aims at highlighting pneumonia as a presentation of N. meningitidis bacteremia, and the need for a high level of clinical suspicion to establish the diagnosis."

N. lactamica colonization may contribute to preventing N. meningitidis colonization and invasive meningococcal disease. However, the transference of antimicrobial resistance genes from N. lactamica to N. meningitidis has been reported. METHODS: In this study, we aimed to identify N. lactamica using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and performed multilocus sequence typing of seven N. lactamica strains isolated from Japanese children. We also analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility of these strains and the mutations in their antimicrobial resistance genes (penA, gyrA, and parC). RESULTS: All the N. lactamica strains could be identified using MALDI-TOF MS. All strains were of different sequence types (STs), including five new STs. Five strains had intermediate susceptibility, two were resistant to ampicillin, and all had five out of the five known PBP2 mutations. Six strains were resistant to levofloxacin. Among the quinolone-resistant strains, three had GyrA mutations, and three had both ParC and GyrA mutations. CONCLUSIONS: N. lactamica STs may vary in Japanese children, and penicillin- and quinolone-resistant strains may be prevalent. We should pay attention not only to the drug resistance of N. meningitidis but also to the drug susceptibility of N. lactamica whose drug-resistance genes may transfer to N. meningitidis."

The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of etiological agents and their relationship with clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in this cohort of patients with CABM. METHODS: Our retrospective chart review analyzed the causative microorganisms, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes of 159 adults with CABM hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Centre of Vilnius University Hospital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. A Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score <= 3 was defined as unfavorable outcome. Predictors of an unfavorable outcome were identified through logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median patient age was 36 (IQR 24-56), and 51.6% were male. Microbiologically confirmed causative agents were identified in 80 (50.3%) patients: N. meningitidis in 55 (34.6%) patients with serotype B accounting for 85% of cases, S. pneumoniae in 15 (9.4%), L. monocytogenes in 5 (3.1%) and other in 5 (3.1%). The clinical triad of fever, neck stiffness and a change in mental status was present in 59.1% of patients. Coexisting conditions and comorbidities were similar in all groups stratified by etiology. Initial antimicrobial treatment consisted of penicillin in 78 patients (49.1%) and ceftriaxone in 72 patients (45.3%). The median time in which antibiotic treatment was started was 40 min (IQR 30.0-90.0). The outcome was unfavorable in 15.7% of episodes and death occurred in 5.7% of cases and did not differ according to the causative agent. Risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were age > 65 years, coexisting pneumonia and a platelet count <150x10e9/l. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative agent of CABM was N. meningitidis, with serotype B clearly dominant. Causative agents did not influence the disease outcome. The strongest risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were older age, pneumonia and a low platelet count. Since the introduction of routine vaccination against meningococcus B for infants in Lithuania in 2018, the national vaccination policy may hopefully contribute to a decrease in the incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease in the Lithuanian population."

In 58% those with viral pneumonia there was evidence of mixed infection with bacteria. The predictive value of rapid laboratory tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP), was evaluated in relation to the aetiological diagnosis. They all differentiated viral from bacterial pneumonia, with CRP having the best predictive value. On the basis of these tests, most cases in which our serological tests remained negative would appear to have a bacterial aetiology also."

Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All specimens from respiratory secretions were Gram stained and cultured onto blood. MacConkey and chocolate (quantitative) agar plates; a BCYE-alpha agar plate was also used when pneumonia was diagnosed. Fifty-five clinical records were retrospectively reviewed of patients with positive cultures for NM, for a 12-year period (1983-1994). RESULTS: A total of 67 samples were positive among the 55 patients studied; sputum and tracheobronchial samples predominated. NM was recovered in pure culture from 48 specimens (71.6%) and with counts higher than 10(6) colony forming units/ml (CFU). Twenty-seven isolates (40.3%) corresponded to serogroup B and 21 isolates (31.3%) did not group with serogroups A, B and C. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed of pneumonia; eleven of these 22 patients had an underlying chronic lung disease. Ten patients had a respiratory overinfection, in eight cases an episode of acute bronchitis was recorded and, finally, in 15 patients there was NM colonization only. CONCLUSION: The pathogenic role of NM in lower respiratory tract infections is probably underestimated because its isolation is difficult, particularly when there is oropharyngeal flora present, since in our study, in which only conventional culture media were used, samples which had NM recovered had a high number of colonies, in pure culture in most cases."

We clinically examined respiratory tract infections from which non-pathogenic Neisseria species were isolated by transtracheal aspiration (TTA). The incidence of non-pathogenic Neisseria isolated was 54 (15.7%) out of 344 episodes of respiratory tract infections with isolated microorganisms from TTA, and was 17.6%, 15.8%, 14.3% for pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and chronic lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. All 54 episodes were isolated with other microorganisms such as alpha-Streptococcus spp. (75.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (25.9%) and anaerobics (22.2%). The isolation ratio according to the age group increased at 45 years of age or more, but did not increase with the advance of age. Predisposing factors were identified such as overt aspiration, iatrogenic procedure and heavy smoking. Cases without overt aspiration that had fevers of 38 degrees C or more or hypoxemia of less than PaO2 70 torr when detecting non-pathogenic Neisseria were observed more frequently in the aged than the non-aged. The findings suggest the detection of non-pathogenic Neisseria by TTA is influenced by the host state that the fall of microorganisms from the upper to lower respiratory tract cannot be defended or excluded by mucociliary transportation disorder due to underlying disease and smoking, or deterioration of physical status other than overt or silent aspiration."

Occasionally, the pathogen invades the mucosa and enters the bloodstream, causing invasive meningococcal disease, a life-threatening infection. While meningococcal colonization is the first step in the development of invasive disease, the risk factors that predict progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic status are not well-known. The present report aimed to describe the prevalence of N. meningitidis carriers throughout the Americas, emphasizing the risk factors associated with carrier status, as well as the most prevalent serogroups in each studied population. We conducted a systematic review by searching for original studies in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, LILACS and SciELO databases, published between 2001 and 2018. Exclusion criteria were articles published in a review format, case studies, case control studies, investigations involving animal models, and techniques or publications that did not address the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in an American country. A total of 784 articles were identified, of which 23 were selected. The results indicate that the highest prevalence rates are concentrated in Cuba (31.9%), the United States (24%), and Brazil (21.5%), with increased prevalence found among adolescents and young adults, specifically university students and males.

A series of 182 consecutive patients, including 83 cases of medical IE, 73 cases of IE in intravenous drug abusers (DA), 22 cases of IE on late prosthetic valves and 4 cases of IE on early prosthetic valves were evaluated since 1976. Medical IE occurred frequently in the elderly patients and in most of the cases (80%) involved natural valves with underlying abnormalities, either rheumatic (42%) or degenerative (33%) or malphormative (25%). Pre-existing valvular pathology was not needed for IE in DA, occurring in 13%, mainly due to a previous IE. In most of the cases IE in DA was a staphylococcal IE (80%) and a right-sided IE (77%). Streptococci were frequent agent both in medical and late prosthetic valves IE (55%): however, a wide pattern of microorganisms, including ""unusual"" pathogens like nutritionally variant Streptococci, Haemophylus parainfluenzae, Haemophylus paraphrophylus, Coxiella burnetii and the so-called ""non pathogen microorganisms"" (e.g. Neisseria sicca) was identified as etiological agent. As regards the clinical approach and diagnosis, the Authors underline some atypical clinical presentations of IE: the pulmonary presentation, occurring in right-sided IE, mainly in DA; the neurological presentation, suggesting staphylococcal etiology and left-sided IE; the vasculitis presentation, miming connective tissue diseases; the cardiac presentation, observed in aortic localization (1 case).

Clinical variety of endocarditis manifestation is wide and has the potential to mimic vasculitis. Whereas Streptococcus bovis is often isolated and associated with colonic tumors, Neisseriaceae are rarely found. An association of subacute bacterial endocarditis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies has been described. We report on a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with acute oliguric renal failure and a nonpruritic purpural rush without fever. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody diagnostic revealed perinuclear staining with a titre of 1 : 512 and antiproteinase-3 specificity. Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis without extracapillary proliferation was diagnosed in renal biopsy. Finally, blood cultures became positive for Streptococcus bovis and Neisseria flava. Echocardiography showed mobile vegetations on tricuspid valve. Under treatment with penicillin G and gentamicin, skin efflorescences and renal function recovered, but vegetations increased. A colonic tumor could be excluded, a disastrous dental status may have been a predisposal factor. When classical findings of subacute bacterial endocarditis are less clear, the presence of renal failure and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in absence of fever may lead to misdiagnosis and deleterious immunosuppressive therapy. Neisseria subflava, an upper respiratory tract commensal, may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis without typical symptoms."

M. Jorgensen et al., Pediatr. Pulmonol. 36:439-446, 2003). We identified two CF patients from our hospital whose sputum specimens were culture positive for P. apista over the course of several years. Repetitive-element-sequence PCR was employed to determine whether sequential isolates that were recovered from these patients represented a single clone and whether each patient had been chronically colonized with the same strain. Banding patterns generated with ERIC primers, REP primers, and BOX primers showed that individual patient isolates had a high degree of similarity (&gt;97%) and were considered identical. However, only the banding patterns from the ERIC primers and BOX primers were able to show that the strains from patients I and II were unique (similarity indices of 79.8% and 70.0%, respectively). We concluded that all strains of P. apista from patient I were identical, as were all strains from patient II, establishing chronic colonization. Only two of the three methods employed indicate that the strains from the two patients are distinct. This implied that the organism was not transferred from one patient to the other, suggesting that the choice of methodology could generate misleading results when examining person-to-person transmission regarding this organism."

Clinical isolates are mostly cultured from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF is a rare disease in China, which makes Pandoraea a total stranger to Chinese physicians. Pandoraea genus is reported as an emerging pathogen in CF patients in most cases. However, there are few pieces of evidence that confirm Pandoraea can be more virulent in non-CF patients. The pathogenicity of Pandoraea genus is poorly understood, as well as its treatment. The incidence of Pandoraea induced infection in non-CF patients may be underestimated and it's important to identify and understand these organisms. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 44-years-old man who suffered from pneumonia and died eventually. Before his condition deteriorated, a Gram-negative bacilli was cultured from his sputum and identified as Pandoraea Apista by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). CONCLUSION: Pandoraea spp. is an emerging opportunistic pathogen. The incidences of Pandoraea related infection in non-CF patients may be underestimated due to the difficulty of identification. All strains of Pandoraea show multi-drug resistance and highly variable susceptibility. To better treatment, species-level identification and antibiotic susceptibility test are necessary."

Chest computed tomography indicated bilateral bronchiectasis and an infiltrative lingular shadow. P. multocida was isolated from sputum samples. Biapenem and minocycline therapy ameliorated symptoms. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that the clinical isolate recovered was identical to the P. multocida isolate recovered from the pharyngeal swab specimen culture obtained from the patient's dog. Several years later, P. multocida subsp. gallicida isolates were recovered from human sputum and a canine pharyngeal swab specimen. PFGE confirmed these isolates to be identical and PFGE band patterns were identical to those of previous P. multocida isolates. These findings suggest that P. multocida was transmitted from the patient's dog to the patient and underscore the need to inform susceptible hosts at risk of contracting zoonotic agents about basic hygiene rules for keeping pets. PFGE data strengthened the evidence of zoonotic transmission of P. multocida through casual contact in a patient with a respiratory infection caused by this organism. PFGE should prove useful in both epidemiological tracing and preventing pasteurellosis and clarifying its pathology. Case reports of respiratory infections including pneumonia caused by P. multocida are increasing in humans, and P. multocida respiratory infections appear to occur mostly in patients with chronic respiratory disease.

The aim of the present study was to determine what respiratory pathogens were involved in pleuritis. In total, lungs of 968 slaughter pigs from 10 herds with high prevalence of pleuritis were morphologically examined for size, location, and type of lesions. Moreover, histology and bacteriology were performed. Examination of gross lung lesions showed 45% pleuritis, 14% pleuropneumonia and 38% catarrhal pneumonia. Peribronchiolar cuffing was found in 61 of 142 samples. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was cultured from 22 lung samples from four herds. Pasteurella multocida was cultured from 55 lung samples in eight herds. No specific pattern with respect to the causal pathogens was found. In conclusion, no single infectious cause of pleuritis was found. A variety of infectious agents combined with environmental factors should be considered as a cause of pleuritis."

Most of these infectious bacteria are not capable of inducing significant disease without the presence of other predisposing environmental factors, physiologic stressors, or concurrent infections. Mannheimia haemolytica is the most common and serious of these bacterial agents and is therefore also the most highly characterized. There are other important bacterial pathogens of BRD, such as Pasteurella multocida, Histophulus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Mixed infections with these organisms do occur. These pathogens have unique and common virulence factors but the resulting pneumonic lesions may be similar. Although the amount and quality of research associated with BRD has increased, vaccination and therapeutic practices are not fully successful. A greater understanding of the virulence mechanisms of the infecting bacteria and pathogenesis of pneumonia, as well as the characteristics of the organisms that allow tissue persistence, may lead to improved management, therapeutics, and vaccines."

However, efficient utilization of this potential resource is hampered by combination of health problems, poor management and feed shortage. Haramaya district is one of the remote settings in Ethiopia where information about the livestock disease is not well documented. Hence this study was conducted to determine the causative agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial Pasteurella isolates among pneumonic ovine in Haramaya district, Eastern Hararghe, Ethiopia. RESULTS: Out of 256 samples examined, Pasteurella was isolated in 64 (25%), of which 38 (59.4%) were from lungs and 26 (40.6%) were from nasal cavities. 87.5% of the isolates were Mannheimia haemolytica and 12.5% were Pasteurella multocida. All of the isolates from the lungs were Mannheimia haemolytica whereas 69% of the isolates from nasals cavities were Mannheimia haemolytica. Age and body temperature were significantly associated with Pasteurella isolates from clinic (P &lt; 0.05). Despite diverse in the site of origins, the isolates exhibited uniformity in sensitivity to a majority of the antibacterial agents. The most effective drug was Cholramphenicol (100%) followed by Sulfamethoxazole (89.1%) and Tetracycline (84.4%). Both species were completely resistant to Gentamycin and Vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Mannheimia haemolytica is the most common cause of ovine pneumonic pasteurellosis in the study area. The isolates were susceptible to limited antimicrobial agents.

In the late summers of 2006 and 2012, severe outbreaks of pneumonia with mortality rates of 25-30% occurred. During the 2012 epidemic high quality samples from culled sick animals were obtained for microbiological and pathological examinations. High throughput sequencing (pyrosequencing) of pneumonic lung tissue revealed high concentrations of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in all six animals examined by this method and Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida in four animals, whereas no virus sequences could be identified. Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and P. multocida multocida were also isolated by culture. Using real time PCR on lung swabs, M. ovipneumoniae was detected in all of the 19 pneumonic lungs examined. Gross pathological examination revealed heavy consolidations primarily in the cranial parts of the lungs and it also identified one case of otitis media. Histologically, lung lesions were characterized as acute to subacute mixed exudative and moderately proliferative bronchoalveolar pneumonia. Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination revealed high load of M. ovipneumoniae antigens within lung lesions, with particularly intensive staining in the neutrophils. Similar IHC finding were observed in archived lung tissue blocks from animals examined during the 2006 epidemic. An M. ovipneumoniae specific ELISA was applied on bio-banked muskox sera from stray muskoxen killed in the period 2004-2013 and sick muskoxen culled, as well as sera from wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) on Dovre and muskoxen from Greenland. Serology and mycoplasma culturing was also carried out on sheep that had been on pasture in the muskox area during the outbreak in 2012. Our findings indicated separate introductions of M. ovipneumoniae infection in 2006 and 2012 from infected co-grazing sheep. Salt licks shared by the two species were a possible route of transmitting infection. "

The role of PmA as a primary pathogen was investigated by challenging pigs with eight field strains isolated from pneumonia and serositis in six Brazilian states. Eight groups of eight pigs each were intranasally inoculated with different strains of PmA (1.5 mL/nostril of 10e7 CFU/mL). The control group (n = 12) received sterile PBS. The pigs were euthanized by electrocution and necropsied by 5 dpi. Macroscopic lesions were recorded, and swabs and fragments of thoracic and abdominal organs were analyzed by bacteriological and pathological assays. The PmA strains were analyzed for four virulence genes (toxA: toxin; pfhA: adhesion; tbpA and hgbB: iron acquisition) by PCR and sequencing and submitted to multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: The eight PmA strains were classified as follows: five as highly pathogenic (HP) for causing necrotic bronchopneumonia and diffuse fibrinous pleuritis and pericarditis; one as low pathogenic for causing only focal bronchopneumonia; and two as nonpathogenic because they did not cause injury to any pig. PCR for the gene pfhA was positive for all five HP isolates. Sequencing demonstrated that the pfhA region of the HP strains comprised four genes: tpsB1, pfhA1, tpsB2 and pfhA2. The low and nonpathogenic strains did not contain the genes tpsB2 and pfhA2. A deletion of four bases was observed in the pfhA gene in the low pathogenic strain, and an insertion of 37 kb of phage DNA was observed in the nonpathogenic strains. MLST clustered the HP isolates in one group and the low and nonpathogenic isolates in another. Only the nonpathogenic isolates matched sequence type 10; the other isolates did not match any type available in the MLST database. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that some PmA strains are primary pathogens and cause disease in pigs without any co-factor was confirmed. The pfhA region, comprising the genes tpsB1, tpsB2, pfhA1 and pfhA2, is related to the pathogenicity of PmA. The HP strains can cause necrotic bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis and pericarditis in pigs and can be identified by PCR amplification of the gene pfhA2."

It is one of the important diseases of small ruminants in Ethiopia. While annual vaccination using a monovalent vaccine (inactivated Pasteurella multocida biotype A) is common, respiratory diseases are still reported in various parts of Ethiopia. This suggests the need for further investigation into the species and strains responsible for the disease, which is vital information for development of a multivalent vaccine. The objective of the current study was to isolate M. heamolytica associated with pneumonic cases of sheep in selected areas of Central Ethiopia, determine its role and the strains/genotypes of the bacterium circulating in the study area. RESULTS: Bacteriological analysis of nasal swab samples collected from a total of 76 pneumonic cases of sheep showed that M. haemolytica was isolated from 26 of them while B.trehalosi from two cases. Further molecular analyses of the isolates using M. haemolytica species-specific and M.haemolytica serotype-1 antigen specific PCR assays revealed, 26 of the isolates were identified as M. haemolytica of which 21 of them were M. haemolytica serotype-1. Both M. haemolytica and B.trehalosi isolates were not detected in a PCR assay targeting capsular biosynthesis gene (capA) of P.multocida despite the non-specific products observed in M. haemolytica isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of M. haemolytica isolates included in this study in comparison with the reference strains with respect to PHSSA and Rpt2 genes revealed that the Ethiopian M. haemolytica isolates constituted three distinct genotypes consistent with site of origin. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that M.haemolytica is commonly associated with cases of pneumonia in sheep in the study areas of central Ethiopia although the remaining other pathogens responsible for majority of the cases are yet to be determined. Molecular characterization revealed the existence of three genotypes of M. haemolytica circulating in the study areas consistent to the site of isolation. The findings suggest further extensive work to determine all pathogens associated with sheep pneumonia and the strain distribution of M. heamolytica to understand its molecular epidemiology at national level and design cost effective prevention and control methods."

In clinically diseased pigs, most P. multocida isolates are characterised as subspecies multocida, biovar 2 or 3 and capsular type A or D; however, there is little information regarding subspecies, biovars, and other capsular types of P. multocida isolates in Korea. Here, we provided information covering an extended time period regarding P. multocida in pigs with pneumonia in Korea using phenotypic and genotypic characterisations and data associated with the minimum inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of P. multocida between 2008 and 2016 was 16.8% (240/1430), with 85% of the P. multocida isolates (204/240) coinfected with other respiratory pathogens. Of the 240 isolates, 166 were included in this study; all of these P. multocida isolates were characterised as subspecies multocida and the most prevalent phenotypes were represented by biovar 3 (68.7%; n = 114) and capsular type A (69.9%; n = 116). Additionally, three capsular type F isolates were identified, with this representing the first report of such isolates in Korea. All biovar 1 and 2 isolates were capsular types F and A, respectively. The virulence-associated gene distribution was variable; all capsular type A and D isolates harboured pmHAS and hsf-1, respectively (P &lt; 0.001), with type F (biovar 1) significantly correlated with hsf-1 (P &lt; 0.05) and pfhA (P &lt; 0.01), biovar 2 highly associated with pfhA and pmHAS, and biovar 3 significantly correlated with hsf-1, pmHAS, and hgbB (P &lt; 0.001), whereas biovar 13 was related only to hgbB (P &lt; 0.05). The highest resistance rate was found to be to oxytetracycline (63.3%), followed by florfenicol (16.3%). CONCLUSIONS: P. multocida subspecies multocida, biovar 3, and capsular type A was the most prevalent isolate in this study, and our findings indicated the emergence of capsular type F in Korea. Moreover, prudent use of oxytetracycline and florfenicol is required because of the identified high resistance rates. Further studies are required for continuous monitoring of the antimicrobial resistance, prevalence, and epidemiological characterisation of P. multocida, and experimental infection models are needed to define the pathogenicity of capsular type F."

Is it caused by Pasteurella multocida infection or congenital pulmonary artery anomalies?ABSTRACT:Introduction: Pasteurella multocida colonizes the oropharynx of various domestic and wild animals. In humans, respiratory tract P. multocida infection is the second most frequent localization and usually manifests as pneumonia. Unilateral absence of pulmonary artery (UAPA) is a very rare congenital anomaly. Adult patients with UAPA are usually asymptomatic or their symptoms are nonspecific. Case report: We report a female patient with hemoptysis admitted to our clinic where we isolated P. multocida in sputum. The organism was also isolated from nasopharyngeal swab of her dog. During hospitalization, she was also diagnosed with UAPA and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Discussion: Respiratory P. multocida infection develops more commonly through contact with animal secretions. It occurs most often in immunocompromised patients and in individuals with comorbidities. Hemoptysis very rarely follows P. multocida infection while it is common in cases of UAPA due to existing developed collateral circulation especially in older patients. Conclusions: Ceased hemoptysis after adequate treatment and no recurrence of it over six years of following up the patient led us to conclude that the cause of hemoptysis was P. multocida infection and not UAPA which was more likely to be the case."

Since then, multiple zoonotic infections affecting humans have been reported. P. multocida infections usually result from bites of cats or dogs. The earliest reports of nonbite transmissions (NBTs) were attributed to cat scratches and lung colonization. More recently, multiple modes of unusual NBTs have been reported, including animal exposures with no direct contact. Here, we report 79 cases of pet-associated infections, with 34 NBTs. Previously unreported and unsuspected, novel modes of NBTs presented include stepping on dog drool infecting a submetatarsal ulcer, contamination of a wound by socks covered with cat hair and dander resulting in P. multocida bacteremia, stumbling over a dog and falling while drunk and abrasions contaminated with dog saliva resulting in wound infection, and severe epiglottitis and supraglottitis after eating peanut butter and crackers half eaten by a dog. Cat bites were more common than dog bites. Both bite and nonbite infections were more common in the elderly, with more older patients in the nonbite group. Upper extremity bites were more than lower extremity bites for both cats and dogs. NBTs were associated with more co-morbidities and resulted in more life-threatening infections than bites, confirming the findings of a prior smaller series. Open wounds were the most common point of entry for nonbite infections, with majority in the lower extremity. Based on this study and prior reports, pet owners must protect open wounds and individuals with certain underlying conditions and infants should avoid pet exposure completely. Our findings and animal transmission of bite and nonbite P. multocida infections reported in literature are summarized."

Disease transmission primarily occurs via animal bites, scratches, and licks on broken skin. P. multocida most commonly causes skin and soft tissue infection and local abscess formation; however, we report a unique case of spinal epidural abscess due to P. multocida infection in a patient with a history of recent epidural steroid injection and repeated cat bites. There is little documentation of P. multocida infection causing spinal epidural abscesses in any patient population, particularly in immunocompetent hosts. This case demonstrates that P. multocida may cause a spinal epidural abscess in a healthy individual without manifesting any other signs or symptoms of the disease process. Thus, it is important to elicit a detailed history regarding animal contact and associated injury. Unless overt sepsis or clinical stability necessitate blood cultures with corresponding administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, targeted IV antimicrobial therapy should be initiated after collection and culture of the epidural abscess aspirate."

The patient did well clinically and was discharged at 14 days to rehabilitation with 6-week intravenous course of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The patient's clinical course with subsequent follow-up suggest that complete resection of the mycotic pseudoaneurysm, followed by omental flap coverage is a viable strategy to manage mycotic aortic infections with virulent organisms."

","SPECIES:Pasteurella multocidaID:32734066TITLE:Antimicrobial resistance of Pasteurella multocida isolates recovered from swine pneumonia in Spain throughout 2017 and 2018.ABSTRACT:A total of 32 Pasteurella multocida isolates were obtained from 60 cases of swine pneumonic lungs collected in ""Castilla y Leon"" (northwestern Spain) between November 2017 and April 2018. Capsular type A isolates were isolated from 96.9% cases and capsular type D from the remaining 3.1%. All isolates were characterized for their susceptibilities to eight antimicrobial agents and the presence of eight resistance genes. The frequency of susceptibility was lower than 60% in four of the drugs, 84.4% of the isolates showed resistance to at least two compounds, and 46.9% to a combination of three drugs. The resistance patterns suggested that enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and cefotaxime were the compounds most likely active to P. multocida. The usage of PCR revealed that ermC, bla ROB1, tetB and msrE genes occurred in more than 37.0% isolates, that suggested its putative accountability in the resistance of the strains harbor them. However, most were detected in susceptible strains and only a genetic explanation for the resistance could be linked to erythromycin. Therefore, the resistances to clyndamicin, cotrimoxazol, beta-lactams and tetracyclin observed by phenotypic testing remains genetically unexplained and further investigations are required."

Data were retrospectively collected from bovine respiratory isolates including Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, and Bibersteinia trehalosi identified at the WVDL between January 2008 and December 2017. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing data were queried from antimicrobial resistance databases at the WVDL. A total of 4,261 isolates were identified. Pasteurella multocida was most frequently identified, accounting for 2,094 isolates (49% of total) over the study period. Mannheimia haemolytica was the second most frequently isolated bacterial respiratory pathogen (n = 1,267, 30%) followed by H. somni (n = 749, 18%) and B. trehalosi (n = 151, 4%). Over the 10-yr period, B. trehalosi had the highest median percentage of isolates that were resistant to at least one antibiotic at 33% (interquartile range: 24, 47) followed by M. haemolytica (13%; 8, 23). For P. multocida, 10% (4, 26) of isolates were classified as resistant to at least one antibiotic, whereas H. somni had the fewest resistant isolates (9%; 3, 15). When comparing 2013-2017 to 2008-2012, the overall percentage of resistant isolates for P. multocida and B. trehalosi decreased, whereas the percentage of resistant isolates for M. haemolytica and H. somni increased. Increased resistance against florfenicol, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and tulathromycin was observed for M. haemolytica. These data show that antimicrobial susceptibility for BRD bacterial pathogens has changed in the population served by the WVDL over this 10-yr period. For P. multocida, resistance is relatively low and has either improved or at least remained constant for the majority of drugs labeled for treatment of respiratory disease in dairy cattle. Veterinarians and producers should be aware of the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with BRD and work toward early disease detection, proper antibiotic administration, and monitoring lung lesions to ensure that their treatment protocols improve lung health."

The study aimed to investigate and characterize M. haemolytica and P. multocida from infected and healthy sheep to rule out the involvement of these bacteria in the disease. Materials and Methods: A total of 374 healthy and infected sheep samples were processed for isolation, direct detection by multiplex PCR (mPCR), and antibiotic susceptibility testing by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Results: Overall, 55 Pasteurella isolates (27 [7.2%] M. haemolytica and 28 [7.4%] P. multocida) were recovered and identified by bacteriological tests and species-specific PCR assays. Significant correlation between the detection of M. haemolytica (66.6%) with disease condition and P. multocida (19.1%) exclusively from infected sheep was recorded by mPCR. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing of 55 isolates revealed higher multidrug resistance in M. haemolytica (25.9%) than P. multocida (7.1%) isolates. Descending resistance towards penicillin (63.6%), oxytetracycline (23.6%), streptomycin (14.5%), and gentamicin (12.7%) and absolute sensitivity towards chloramphenicol were observed in both the pathogens. The antibiotic resistance genes such as strA (32.7%) and sul2 (32.7%) associated with streptomycin and sulfonamide resistance, respectively, were detected in the isolates. Conclusion: The study revealed the significant involvement of M. haemolytica together with P. multocida in ovine respiratory infection and is probably responsible for frequent disease outbreaks even after vaccination against hemorrhagic septicemia in sheep population of Karnataka, southern province of India."

METHODS: The records of the children with diagnosis of pleural effusion admitted at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu between January 1995 and February 2001 were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty out of forty two patients reviewed were analysed. There were 20 males, and 20 females (ratio of 1: 1), with age range of 3 months to 156 months (13 years) and the mean age of 4.99 years. The presenting symptoms were fever in 40 patients (100% ), cough in 38 (97.40% ), dyspnea in 36 (90.00% ), breathlessness in 27 (67.5% ), while, the most common physical sign was pallor. Thirty six children had diagnostic thoracocentesis. Twenty four (55.81% ) yielded pus, out of which, 10 grew organisms on culture; Streptococcus Pneumonia in 3, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, coliforms in 2, Haemophilus influenzae in 1, Proteus mirabilis in 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1. Nine patients received ampicillin/cloxacillin combination alone; 31 received ampicillin/cloxacillin with other antibiotics, including anti- tuberculous drugs in four children. Thirty-five of the children had thoracotomy, and one later had thoracotomy and decortication. Thirty-seven (92.5% ) were discharged home on recovery. The average admission duration was 24 days. Mortality rate was 7.50%. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, there appears to be an evolving change in epidemiological pattern in comparison with the previous study from this center. There is need to improve on the diagnostic procedure and treatment modalities in order to establish definite criteria for antibiotic use and surgical intervention."

After cardiac bypass surgery in 1997, the patient experienced herpes simplex virus (HSV type-1) infection of the skin that was treated by intravenous aciclovir. In 2003, he presented a widespread atypical exacerbation of his Darier disease, involving the face, trunk, buttocks, intertriginous areas and arms. Initial clinical signs and bacteriological findings suggested a bacterial involvement by multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Despite antibiotherapy, the clinical presentation progressively worsened. A skin biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical examination identified a type-2 HSV infection. Although intravenous aciclovir was administered, the widespread cutaneous HSV infection was followed by systemic dissemination. A severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed, leading to a fatal issue. At autopsy, a severe interstitial type-2 HSV pneumonitis with extensive necrotic areas was found, in association with gastro-intestinal involvement. This case represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of Darier disease presenting a fatal type-2 HSV infection. It underlines the importance of rapidly recognizing HSV infection in Darier disease and stresses the risk of lethal outcome. The different risk factors for HSV infection in this patient are reviewed."

Ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms. However, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in VAP. Our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of ertapenem in the treatment of VAP caused by susceptible ESBL strains. METHODS: Ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of VAP beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative organisms. RESULTS: From June 2005 to June 2006, we enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an ICU and diagnosed with VAP due to Gram-negative ESBL strains. Causative organisms identified as ESBL producers susceptible to ertapenem were Klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Proteus mirabilis (2) and Citrobacter freundii (2). Clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. The drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Ertapenem appears to be suitable for ESBL VAP therapy. This pilot study suggests subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication."

Some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), were identified. Pulsotypes of ESBL-producing P. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The prevalences of MRSA, ESBL-producing E. coli (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) P. aeruginosa, MDR-PA, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and MDR-AB were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0% and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. Among the 44 respiratory isolates of P. mirabilis with an ESBL phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (&gt;80% identity) were identified. Among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). High prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in RCWs."

Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of NI and to identify groups of patients at special risk for NI in the University Clinical Center, Kragujevac, Serbia. METHODS: A period prevalence study design was used in this study. A survey of NI included all patients hospitalized in all departments in the University Clinical Center, Kragujevac. RESULTS: Among 764 patients surveyed, the global prevalence rate of patients with at least one NI was 6.2% (95% CI = 5.6-6.8), while the prevalence of NI was 7.1%. The most frequent infections were surgical site infections (14.1%; 95% CI = 12.9-15.3), followed by pneumonia (2.3%; 95% CI = 2.1-2.5) in surgical patients. In medical wards, the most common NI were skin and subcutaneous tissue infections (1.6%; 95% CI = 1.4-1.8), and urinary infections (1.4%; 95% CI = 1.3-1.5). Overall, 85.1% NI were culture-proven; the leading pathogens were Pseudomonas species (40.0%), followed by Staphylococcus species (25.0%), Escherichia coli (22.5%), Proteus mirabilis (17.5%) and Klebsiella-Enterobacter (12.5%).

METHODS: We analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from January 2007 to December 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. The reading causes of hospital infections were UTIs (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (CAP; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP; 17.2%). Of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, UTIs were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by CAP (n=809, 26%) and HAP (n=533, 17.2%). Of 278 UTIs in 2007, the causative strains were Escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), Enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), Proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%).

The UTI rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. We treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. Antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. It remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients.

A high prevalence of ESBL production among multidrug resistant gram negative isolates has been reported in literature from various clinical samples. Since ESBL detection is not done on a routine basis, its prevalence is not known till date. Thus the present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ESBL production in gram negative isolates from pyogenic infection. A total of 300 gram negative bacilli isolated from the pus samples were identified phenotypically and antimicrobial activity was determined. ESBL detection among the isolated organisms was done by Phenotypic confirmatory disc diffusion technique recommended by CLSI. Of the 300 isolates, majority were Escherichia coli; (107) followed by Acinetobacter species; (55), Pseudomonas species; (44), Klebsiella pneumoniae; (32), Proteus mirabilis; (26), Enterobacter species; (25), Citrobacter species; (9) and others; (2). The prevalence of ESBL producing organisms was found to be 54 (18%); amongst which Escherichia coli was 29 (53.7%), Klebsiella pneumonia (14.8%), Proteus mirabilis 7 (12.9%) and others 4 (7.4%). Multidrug resistance were found in 92.6% of ESBL producers. Forty two were resistant to all the three third generation cephalosporins.

The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity. "

We identified plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. RESULTS: Among the 323 non-ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset UTIs, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for AmpC. Escherichia coli was the most common AmpC-producing organism (60%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). The independent risk factors for acquisition of AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae included prior history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (OR) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (OR = 4.049; 95% CI = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (OR = 9.683; 95% CI = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). AmpC-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. Carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. The most commonly identified plasmid-mediated AmpC gene was bla(CIT), followed by bla(DHA)/bla(EBC), and bla(MOx). CONCLUSION: For community-onset UTIs, AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. To treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered."

METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished."

A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

We report the case of a 74-year-old male who was admitted with a cough and sputum production. He had been treated with oral dexamethasone since a brain tumorectomy 6 months prior. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a large pneumatocele in the right middle lobe and peripheral pneumonic consolidation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed; cultures identified extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Proteus mirabilis. A 4-week course of intravenous ertapenem was administered, and the pneumatocele with pneumonia resolved on follow-up chest CT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pulmonary pneumatocele caused by ESBL-producing P. mirabilis associated with pneumonia. "

These pathogens constitute a further threat because they are also resistant to numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, as well as other antibiotic groups. This study retrospectively investigates antimicrobial resistance in hospitalized patients suffering from pneumonia triggered by Gram-negative Serratia marcescens or Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: The demographic and clinical data analyzed in this study were obtained from the clinical databank of the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, for inpatients presenting with pneumonia triggered by S. marcescens or P. mirabilis from 2004 to 2014. An antibiogram was conducted for the antibiotics utilized as part of the management of patients with pneumonia triggered by these two pathogens. RESULTS: Pneumonia was caused by Gram-negative bacteria in 115 patients during the study period from January 1, 2004, to August 12, 2014. Of these, 43 (37.4 %) hospitalized patients [26 males (60.5 %, 95 % CI 45.9 %-75.1 %) and 17 females (39.5 %, 95 % CI 24.9 %-54.1 %)] with mean age of 66.2 +- 13.4 years had pneumonia triggered by S. marcescens, while 20 (17.4 %) patients [14 males (70 %, 95 % CI 49.9 %-90.1 %) and 6 females (30 %, 95 % CI 9.9 %-50.1 %)] with a mean age of 64.6 +- 12.8 years had pneumonia caused by P. mirabilis. S. marcescens showed an increased antibiotic resistance to ampicillin (100 %), ampicillin-sulbactam (100 %), and cefuroxime (100 %). P. mirabilis had a high resistance to tetracycline (100 %) and ampicillin (55 %). S. marcescens (P &lt; 0.0001) and P. mirabilis (P = 0.0003) demonstrated no resistance to cefepime in these patients with pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: S. marcescens and P. mirabilis were resistant to several commonly used antimicrobial agents, but showed no resistance to cefepime."

Of 8796 biological samples, consisting mainly of bronchial aspirate (97.9 %), 2056 bacterial strains were isolated and subjected to identification. VITEK 2 was used to determine drug susceptibility (classified according to the EUCAST criteria). ESBL, MBL and KPC-producing strains were identified by means of phenotypic methods using appropriate discs. The findings were that the predominant bacteria responsible for infections consisted of Enterobacteriaceae (42.0 %), Acinetobacter baumannii (37.2 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.1 %), and Stenotrophomonas maltophila (4.7 %). We observed a rise in the number of bacteria causing pneumonia throughout the study period, especially in S. maltophila and Enterobacteriaceae ESBL (+). Gram-negative bacilli were 100 % susceptible to colistin, apart from naturally resistant strains such as Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, whereas Enterobacteriaceae ESBL (+) were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. Acinetobacter baumannii strains exhibited the lowest drug susceptibility. In conclusion, we report an increase in the prevalence of pneumonia associated with Gram-negative bacteria in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients. Colistin remains the most effective drug against the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. Therapeutic problems are common in the course of treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infections."

METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 12 antibiotics for 4,332 aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli, sampled in 21 hospitals in 16 cities, were determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae composed 88.5% of the total isolates, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) (63.2%) the most commonly isolated species, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (12.2%). Non-Enterobacteriaceae accounted for only 11.5% of all isolates and included mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (6.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) (3.3%). Among the antimicrobial agents tested, the susceptibility rates of E.coli to the two carbapenems, ertapenem and imipenem as well as amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam ranged from 92.5 to 98.7%. Against K. pneumonia, the most potent antibiotics were imipenem (92.6% susceptibility), amikacin (89.2% susceptibility) and ertapenem (87.9% susceptibility). Although non-Enterobacteriaceae did not show high susceptibilities to the 12 common antibiotics, amikacin exhibited the highest in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa over the 5-year study period, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) rates decreased slowly during the 5 years in E. coli from 68.6% in 2010 to 59.1% in 2014, in K. pneumoniae from 59.7 to 49.2%, and in Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) from 40.0 to 26.1%. However, the ESBL rates were different in 5 regions of China (Northeast, North, East, South and Middle-China). CONCLUSION: E. coli and K. pneumonia were the major pathogens causing UTIs and carbapenems and amikacin retained the highest susceptibility rates over the 5-year study period, indicating that they are good drug choices for empirical therapies, particularly of CA UTIs in China."

PmTAN59 was isolated from a sputum swab from a pneumonia patient in Tanta University Teaching Hospital. PmKAF126 was isolated from a patient with a diabetic foot infection in a hospital in the city of Kafr El-Sheikh. The two isolates were identified with bacterial small ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplification and sequencing and tested for antimicrobial sensitivity with a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay. The two strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulante, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprime, and tetracycline, but sensitive to aztreonam, imipenem, and meropenem. Molecular characterization was used to map the entire backbone, including the multiple antibiotic resistance (MDR) region, of Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1). Both isolates carried a structure similar to SGI1, with two different MDR regions corresponding to SGI1-PmABB in PmTAN59 and SGI1-W in PmKAF126. SGI1-PmABB carried an integron of ~1.5kb with a two-gene cassette, aacCA5-aadA7, which confers resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and spectinomycin, whereas SGI1-W carried an integron of ~1.9kb containing aadA2-lnuF, which confers resistance to spectinomycin, streptomycin, and lincosamides. PmKAF126 carried the entire SGI1 sequence, however PmTAN59 carried a SGI1 structure with a deletion in the region from ORF S005 to ORF S009 and accompanied by insertion of IS1359 (1258bp). Furthermore, PmTAN59 carried class 2 integron of ~2.2kb containing dfrA1-sat2-aadA1. An ERIC-PCR analysis detected no clonal relationship between the two strains. Molecular screening for other antimicrobial resistance genes and a plasmid analysis indicated that PmTAN59 carried an IncFIB plasmid type. This strain also carried blaTEM-1 and the plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance gene qnrA1. However, PmKAF126 carried no plasmids and no resistance gene other than that contained in the MDR region of SGI1 and floR gene conferring resistance to florfenicol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an SGI1-positive P. mirabilis strain in Egypt or on the entire African continent."

Methods: A retrospective study of a total of 106 microbiologically febrile episodes in hospitalized adult neutropenic cancer patients, who were admitted from May 2009 to May 2013, at King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Results: Among 106 microbiologically documented febrile neutropenic episodes, the majority of malignancies were solid tumors accounting for 53.8% (57/106) and hematological malignancies accounted for 46.23% (49/106). The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 19.81% (21/106) followed by acute myeloid leukemia 15.09% (16/106), then colorectal cancer 13.21% (14/106), pancreatic cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 5.66% (6/106) each, multiple myeloma 4.72% (5/106), gall bladder cancer 3.77% (4/106), and lung cancer 2.83% (3/106). A total of 138 bacterial isolates were identified. The overall prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was 65.94% (91/138) and for gram-positive bacteria was 34.06% (47/138). The most common bacterial isolation sites were blood 33.32% (46 isolates), urine 29.71% (41 isolates), wound 19.55% (27 isolates), body fluids 9.41% (13 isolates) and sputum 7.96% (11 isolates). The most predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli 30.43 (42/138), Klebsiella pneumonia 14.49% (20/138), Staphylococcus aureus 13.04% (18/138), Sptreptococcus spp. 7.25% (10/138), Pseudomonas spp. 7.25% (10/138), Enterococcus spp. 5.80% (8/138), Staphylococcus spp. 4.35% (6/138), Corynebacterium spp. 3.62% (5/138), Enterobacter spp. 3.62% (5/138), Acinobacter spp. 2.90% (4/138), Serratia marcescens 2.17% (3/138), Proteus mirabilis 1.45% (2). Aeromonas hydrophylia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Stenotropomonas multipholia contributed to 0.72% with one isolate each. For gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers (ESBLs) rates were 38% and 22.22% respectively. For Pseudomonas aerugenosa imipenem-cilastatin resistance rate was 18.84%. For gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was 28.62%. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) rate was 1.18%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent as a cause of infection in adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia at our institution, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia with high ESBLs rates being the most common pathogens. Blood stream infections followed by urinary tract infections were the most common sites of infection. The use of initial antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic episodes should be based on local bacterial spectrum and susceptibility/sensitivity patterns to prevent treatment failure with increased morbidity and mortality."

If unusual organisms are isolated from the pleural space, further investigation is warranted to locate the primary source. We present a patient with an infected chronic renal cyst found to have an empyema secondary to Proteus mirabilis to highlight the importance of further diagnostic workup when encountering unusual organisms in the pleural space. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old African-American female, with a past medical history of asthma and sickle cell trait, presented with 5 weeks of upper respiratory tract symptoms and chest pain. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was negative for a pulmonary embolism but revealed a loculated left sided pleural effusion with associated left-lower lobe consolidation. She was started on empiric antibiotics, and a chest tube was inserted with drainage of frank pus. Fluid gram stain was positive for gram negative rods. Intrapleural fibrinolytics were administered for 72 h given the presence of loculations. With no improvement following fibrinolytics, she was taken to the operating room for large bore chest tube placement and left visceral pleura decortication. Pleural fluid cultures speciated to Proteus mirabilis, so further cross-sectional imaging of her abdomen/pelvis was pursued to evaluate for a primary source. A complex cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney that communicated with the ipsilateral diaphragm was identified. Subsequent drainage and culture of the renal cyst was positive for Proteus mirabilis. Given clinical improvement following these interventions she was discharged with an extended course of antibiotics with plans for repeat imaging following completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While cases of Proteus mirabilis empyema have previously been reported as a consequence of conditions such as pyelonephritis, we present, to our knowledge, the first case of a Proteus mirabilis empyema as a consequence of an infected renal cyst communicating with the pleural space. This study highlights that further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is warranted when unusual organisms are found in the pleural space. Anatomic abnormalities that become apparent on imaging may help elucidate the source of infection."

","SPECIES:Proteus mirabilisID:4073097TITLE:Lower respiratory tract infection.ABSTRACT:The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis.

An antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. Cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. Organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae in 6, E. coli in 3, Proteus mirabilis in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. The Serratia were resistant (MIC greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other MIC's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. Satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. Two patients died from their underlying disease. Adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included SGOT rises in 3 and rash in one. Serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to 12.5 microgram/ml (trough). Sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml.

Special considerations in a special population.ABSTRACT:Bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract in the elderly may not be as atypical in presentation as traditional wisdom once held. Recent studies indicate that more than one in three elderly patients have fever, cough, and leukocytosis; nevertheless, some elderly patients present with none of the features typically associated with pneumonia. An important and consistent clinical difference between younger and older patients is the broader range of bacterial respiratory pathogens found in the elderly, including gram-negative bacilli such as Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Little is gained by the initial use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and much may be lost. Parenteral third-generation cephalosporins and oral fluoroquinolones are active against the major pathogens and can be used for empirical broad-spectrum therapy. Recent trials indicate that results are equally good with agents of either type. Perhaps a third of elderly patients with pneumonia do not require or benefit from hospitalization.

For this purpose, we reviewed the medical records of all OHSS patients hospitalized in 16 out of 19 tertiary medical centres in Israel between January 1987 and December 1996. Febrile morbidity was defined as at least one episode of temperature rise above 38 degrees C lasting &gt; or =24 h. A total of 2902 patients (3305 hospitalizations) with OHSS was identified, of whom 196 had severe, and 13 critical, OHSS. Among the 209 patients investigated the incidence of febrile morbidity was 82.3%, of which 20.5% was attributed to urinary tract infection, 3.8% to pneumonia, 3.3% to upper respiratory tract infection, 2.0% to intravenous line phlebitis, 1.0% to cellulitis at an abdominal puncture site, 1.0% to postoperative wound infections and 0.5 % to gluteal abscess at the site of progesterone injection. Non-typical organisms were frequently isolated, such as Pseudomonas, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter species. No infectious aetiology was found in 105 patients (50.2%). Hypoglobulinaemia was recorded in most patients, while ascitic and pleural fluids aspirated from these patients contained high globulin concentrations. We conclude that infection-related febrile morbidity in severe and critical OHSS is high, and may be attributed to some degree of immunodeficiency associated with loss of plasma globulins to the third space. However, non-infection-related febrile morbidity is even higher and may be attributed to endogenous pyrogenic mechanisms."

Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia."

The increase in multi-drug resistant bacteria has not been accompanied by the validation of new drugs, or by any new antimicrobial strategies to exploit the available agents. VAP due to Gram-negative bacteria has increased mortality, both due to the resistant pathogens themselves and due to inappropriate treatment. Local epidemiology, patients' characteristics and clinical responses provide the most important information for therapeutic decision-making. Moreover, data on VAP therapy due to resistant bacteria are lacking, and the choice of treatment is often based on clinical practice and individual experience. Areas covered: This review summarizes the strategies available for treating the three most prevalent resistant Gram-negative organisms causing VAP: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. The review covers the results of a Pubmed search, clinical practice guidelines and reviews, and the authors' experience. Expert opinion: The existing evidence focuses on bloodstream infections or other sites rather than pneumonia and there are no recommendations for the treatment of VAP by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, especially for combination regimens. The approval of new drugs is needed to provide effective and safe alternatives for treating carbapenemase-producing strains. Precision medicine and personalized approach are also fundamental in future research."

We evaluated the prevalence, risk factors, and characteristics of immunocompromised patients coming from the community with pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of an international, multicenter study enrolling adult patients coming from the community with pneumonia and hospitalized in 222 hospitals in 54 countries worldwide. Risk factors for immunocompromise included AIDS, aplastic anemia, asplenia, hematological cancer, chemotherapy, neutropenia, biological drug use, lung transplantation, chronic steroid use, and solid tumor. RESULTS: At least 1 risk factor for immunocompromise was recorded in 18% of the 3702 patients enrolled. The prevalences of risk factors significantly differed across continents and countries, with chronic steroid use (45%), hematological cancer (25%), and chemotherapy (22%) the most common. Among immunocompromised patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens were the most frequently identified, and prevalences did not differ from those in immunocompetent patients. Risk factors for immunocompromise were independently associated with neither Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor non-community-acquired bacteria. Specific risk factors were independently associated with fungal infections (odds ratio for AIDS and hematological cancer, 15.10 and 4.65, respectively; both P = .001), mycobacterial infections (AIDS; P = .006), and viral infections other than influenza (hematological cancer, 5.49; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could be considered by clinicians in prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP in immunocompromised patients. Patients with AIDS and hematological cancer admitted with CAP may have higher prevalences of fungi, mycobacteria, and noninfluenza viruses."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of previous antibiotic therapy on the incidence of VAP, mortality and spectrum of bacterial pathogens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective, observational study comprised patients over 18 years of age meeting the clinical criteria of VAP. Controls were patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours with no signs of VAP. Each group was divided into two arms according to previous antibiotic therapy. Tracheal aspirates and oropharyngeal swabs were taken from all patients. Cultured isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines. In both groups, 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogen frequency were evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 49 patients (32 patients with previous antibiotic therapy, 17 antimicrobial-naive patients). The proportion of individuals with previous antibiotic therapy was significantly lower in VAP patients (34%) than among controls group (66%; p = 0.02). The VAP criteria were met by 23 patients (11 with previous antibiotic therapy, 12 without the therapy). The Enterobacteriaceae including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common pathogens isolated. MDR pathogens were statistically significantly more frequent in patients with previous antibiotic therapy (77% vs. 33%; p = 0.047). In patients with previous antibiotic therapy, 28-day mortality was lower (18%; n = 2) than in antimicrobial-naive patients (33%, n = 4; p = 0.640). The difference was more pronounced in 90-day mortality, albeit with low statistical significance (18%, n = 2 vs. 58%, n = 7; p = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS: Previous antibiotic therapy was associated with a lower incidence of VAP and a higher frequency of MDR bacterial pathogens. VAP antibiotic therapy modified according to knowledge of previous antibiotic therapy and cultured isolates was correlated with lower 28-day and 90-day mortality rates."

Acinetobacter baumanii (AB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are important pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with a trend of high resistance to carbapenems. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors for VAP due to carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (CRAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) in children. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, an active, prospective observational study was conducted in Gazi University Hospital. Patients from Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), between 1 month and 12 years of age with VAP due to AB and PA were included. RESULTS: During this period, 74 children experienced 126 VAP episodes due to Acinetobacter baumanii (N.=58) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N.=68). Among these, 93.1% (N.=54) of AB and 51.5% (N.=35) of PA were carbapenem resistant. In univariate analysis, length of stay in PICU until the diagnosis of VAP, presence of central venous catheters, prior use of cefepime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, and teicoplanin were associated with VAP due to CRPA (P=0.02, P=0.02, P=0.006, P=0.01, P=0.001, and P=0.009 respectively). Significant association was not found between the development of VAP due to CRAB and the investigated risk factors. Regression analyses revealed previous use of cefepime (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.016-0.595, P=0.039) and colistin (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 0.061-0.789, P=0.023) to be independently associated with VAP due to CRPA. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that broad spectrum antibiotic usage was the most important risk factor for the development of VAP due to CRPA."

Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.One hundred and fifty-three LT recipients presented 174 ICUr a median of 6 months [IQR 2-25] post-LT. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was reported in 39 (25.5%) recipients, 13 of whom (all exitus) had restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). Acute respiratory failure (ARF) (110, 71.9%) was the main condition requiring ICUr. Graft rejection (six, 5% acute) caused only 12 (11%) admissions whereas pneumonia (56, 36.6%) was the main cause (50 admitted for ARF and six for shock), with P. aeruginosa (50% multidrug-resistant) being the predominant pathogen. Fifty-five (35.9%) and 69 (45.1%) recipients died in the ICU and the hospital respectively. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) stage-2 (adjusted-OR: 7.2 (1-65.7)), BOS stage-3 (aOR: 13.7 (2.5-95.3)), RAS (aOR: &gt;50) and pneumonia at ICUr (aOR: 2.5 (1-7.1)) were identified in multivariate analyses as independent predictors of ICU mortality. Only eight (5%) patients had positive donor-specific antibodies prior to ICUr, and this variable did not affect the model.In conclusion, ARF was the main condition requiring ICUr in LT recipients, and was associated with high mortality. Pneumonia was the main cause of death, and was also an independent predictor. RAS should receive palliative care rather than ICU admission."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the features of the etiological structure of neonatal pneumonia complicated by BPD, and to determine the sensitivity of pathogens to antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 194 preterm infants with VAP, birth weight from 780 to 2820 g and gestational age from 27 to 37 weeks was conducted. A microbiological study of washings from the respiratory tract was conducted by standard qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Respiratory tract infections caused by E. coli (with hemolytic properties), Enterococcus spp. (with hemolytic properties), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, various types of mycoplasmas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida krusei were found 4- 13 times more frequent in preterm infants with BPD than in preterm infants without BPD and more mature infants with or without this complication. BPD developed 7- 11 times more frequent in preterm infants with prolonged VAP and change in pathogens than in preterm infants with VAP without change of agent. BPD developed 5- 7 times more frequent in preterm infants with the association of pathogens than in preterm infants with a monoinfection. Massive colonization of respiratory tract pathogens by 1- 3 days of life (lg4 colony forming units in 1 ml and above) was an unfavorable prognostic factor for the development of VAP, complicated by BPD. CONCLUSION: The reduction in the frequency of BPD is might be possible with timeous and adequate antibacterial therapy of VAP."

Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed or because of unrecognition of the pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managing in general wards. METHODS: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 h were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study. RESULTS: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood culture than patients with non-severe CAP (24% VS 4.5%; p = .008). Initial antibiotic treatment were discordant with the IDSA/ATS guidelines in 42% of all patients hospitalized with CAP, and 52% of patients with severe CAP. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and initial antibiotic treatment discordant to guidelines for severe CAP in ICU (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3-17.1) were independent risk factors of the unfavorable outcome of patients with severe CAP. Patients with unfavorable outcome had lower number of hospital-free days than patients with favorable outcome (5.2 +- 8 days VS 18 +- 7.1 days; p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes."

Klebsiella spp. are major pathogens in healthcare-associated infections, and their importance is increasing. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of Klebsiella spp. chest infections by evaluating the differences in the characteristics of chest infections caused by Klebsiella spp. and pneumoniae. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients hospitalized with pneumonia, lung abscess/necrotizing pneumonia, and empyema due to Klebsiella spp. and S. pneumoniae for 15 years at our institution in Saitama, Japan. Patients Patients with chest infections due to Klebsiella spp. (K group, n=76) and S. pneumoniae (S group, n=446) were included. Results The K group more frequently was male, older, coinfected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and had diabetes mellitus, a history of upper digestive system surgery, alcohol drinking habit, a smoking habit, and an impaired premorbid performance status than the S group. The percentages of lung abscesses or necrotizing pneumonia (31.6% vs. 0.9%) and empyema without pulmonary parenchymal shadow (3.9% vs. 0.7%) were higher in the K group than those in the S group. Severity on admission and mortality did not differ between the groups; however, patients in the K group required a longer duration of antibiotics administration and hospital stay than those in the S group.

Estimating its financial burden is complicated by the time-dependent nature of the disease. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-six cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related pneumonia were recorded at a 2000 bed German teaching hospital between 2011 and 2014. Thirty-five cases (15%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hospital- and community-acquired cases were distinguished by main diagnoses and exposure time. The impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related pneumonia on the three endpoints cost, reimbursement, and length of stay was analyzed, taking into account (1) the time-dependent nature of exposure, (2) clustering of costs within diagnostic groups, and (3) additional confounders. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia is associated with substantial additional costs that are not fully reimbursed. Costs are highest for hospital-acquired cases ($19,000 increase over uninfected controls). However, community-acquired cases are also associated with a substantial burden ($8400 when Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia is the main reason for hospitalization, and $6700 when not). Sensitivity analyses for hospital-acquired cases showed that ignoring or incorrectly adjusting for time-dependency substantially biases results. Furthermore, multidrug-resistance was rare and only showed a measurable impact on the cost of community-acquired cases. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia creates a substantial financial burden for hospitals. This is particularly the case for nosocomial infections. Infection control interventions could yield significant cost reductions. However, to evaluate the potential effectiveness of different interventions, the time-dependent aspects of incremental costs must be considered to avoid introduction of bias."

The aim of our study was to evaluate the demography, incidence, risk factors, causative bacterial pathogens and outcome of all episodes of Hospital-acquired pneumonia in our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study, at a tertiary university hospital during one year (2014) including all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Sixty patients were identified with pneumonia. Thirty-five (58.3%) had an intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, corresponding to 6.9 cases/1000 intubation-days. Antibiotic treatment in the previous 30 days was present in 75% of the cases. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 26.2%, 20.0% and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with late-onset hospital-acquired pneumonia (>= 7 days) showed higher frequency of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolates, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Combination therapy was performed in 67.0%, and de-escalation in 18.3%. The mortality rate was 18.3%. The adjusted odds ratio for intensive care unit mortality in the group of patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia was 5.2 (95% CI of 1.02 - 22.10; p = 0.046). DISCUSSION: The knowledge of local bacterial flora and resistance patterns is of crucial importance and strongly recommended. This evidence increases the probability of success of empiric antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: S. aureus was the predominant causative agent of nosocomial pneumonia. The most frequent risk factor identified for infection with multidrug-resistant organisms was previous treatment with antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant organisms were present in 45% of documented hospital-acquired pneumonias. In admitted patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, the intensive care unit mortality rate was nearly five times higher compared to intensive care unit acquired pneumonia."

The aim of this study is to i) determine the prevalence of adequate antibiotic treatment of P. aeruginosa in an unselected group of adult non-cystic fibrosis patients and ii) to assess the overall mortality in study patients treated with adequate vs. non-adequate antibiotics. METHODS: Prospective, observational study of all adult patients with culture verified P. aeruginosa from 1 January 2010-31 December 2012 in Region Zealand, Denmark. Patients with cystic fibrosis were excluded. Adequate therapy was defined as any antibiotic treatment including at least one antipseudomonal beta-lactam for a duration of at least 10 days. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa had to be tested susceptible to the given antipseudomonal drug and treatment had to be approved by senior clinician to fulfil the adequate-criteria. RESULTS: A total of 250 patients were identified with pulmonary P. aeruginosa. The vast majority (80%) were treated with non-adequate antibiotic therapy. All-cause mortality rate after 12 months was 49% in adequate treatment group vs. 52% in non-adequate treatment group. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, bacteraemia, comorbidities and bronchiectasis showed no significant difference in mortality between treatment groups (adequate vs. non-adequate: hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.59-1.52, P = 0.82).

METHODS: Real-time surveillance was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All HAIs were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly >=60 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, chi2 = 202.421, P < 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower. CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher overall incidence of HAI in elderly inpatients >=60 compared to non-elderly inpatients < 60 years, but the trend was different for device-associated HAIs, which was attributed to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in the elderly group. The main HAI sites in elderly inpatients were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and bloodstream, and the main pathogens were gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans."

The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations."

","SPECIES:Pseudomonas aeruginosaID:32143960TITLE:A case of recovery from aphasia following dose reduction of cefepime by bayesian prediction-based therapeutic drug monitoring.ABSTRACT:Cefepime is known to exert bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity, most likely caused by increased exposure, has recently become a major concern in clinical practice; therefore, appropriate dose reduction of cefepime should be applied with respect to patients with low cefepime clearance (mostly eliminated by the kidneys). Here, we report a case in which Bayesian prediction-based therapeutic drug monitoring (Bayes-TDM) was effectively used to reduce the dose of cefepime in a patient with pneumonia to prevent neurotoxic complications. A woman (age: 59 years, body weight: 32.5 kg, serum creatinine concentration: 1.02 mg/dL) developed pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa while receiving treatment for scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus. She started treatment with a dosing regimen of 1.0 g of cefepime every 8 h (day X). On day X+5, aphasia developed, and the serum cefepime concentration was 71.3 mg/L at trough. This concentration was twice or thrice higher than the reported safe concentration of cefepime (22 or 35 mg/L at trough). Therefore, we reduced the dose of cefepime to 0.5 g every 12 h using Bayes-TDM from day X+7. As a result, the severity of aphasia decreased by day X+10, and this dose was successfully continued up to day X+13 without further adjustment. In conclusion, individualizing doses by Bayes-TDM may be useful in preventing adverse effects associated with cefepime treatment."

This compound shows excellent activity against most gram-negative organisms causative of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP), including extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Areas covered: This article reviews the spectrum of activity, the main pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and the clinical efficacy and safety of ceftolozane-tazobactam in the treatment of HAP/VAP in adult patients.Expert opinion: The results of a randomized clinical trial have demonstrated an efficacy and safety profile of ceftolozane-tazobactam similar to that of its comparator for the treatment of patients with HAP/VAP. Several retrospective studies have shown good efficacy of the drug for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa. The use of this drug may be incorporated as a new therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with HAP/VAP in a carbapenem-saving setting or as a therapeutic alternative with a better safety profile than other therapeutic options in patients with infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa."

While TZP-induced thrombocytopenia is a well-known and easily diagnosed complication, we herein present an unusual case of spontaneous TZP-induced bleeding caused by platelet dysfunction. CASE SUMMARY: A 73-year-old-man experienced severe pulmonary hemorrhage and bloody diarrhea during the treatment with TZP for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. While both platelet count and coagulation tests were normal, platelet functional test revealed severely impaired ADP-dependent platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION: Platelet dysfunction is a little-known mechanism of TZP-induced bleeding. This is the second reported case of TZP-related bleeding that has been attributed to platelet dysfunction, and the first case report that has not been associated with surgery. While thrombocytopenia is easily recognized, this form of TZP-induced bleeding can be detected only by platelet functional tests. : ."

Drugs including cephalosporin, vancomycin, and imipenem/cilastatin combined with ciprofloxacin were used successively for anti-infective treatment, with no obvious effect. Multiple bacterial culture results of sputum, blood, and wound exudate showed infection of extensively drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. On the 4th day of admission, the anti-infective treatment plan was adjusted, and plasma, red blood cell, and albumin were supplemented and nutritional support and symptomatic treatment were performed. At the same time, medication and drug-related adverse reaction were monitored. After treatment for more than 10 days, infection of the patient was effectively controlled and the condition gradually improved. The case suggests that severely burned patients are prone to have serious and fatal systemic infection, irregular use of antibiotics increases the risk of infection of extensively drug resistant bacteria, clear anti-infection idea and effective application of antibacterial drug can help to improve the success rate of infection treatment and are of important value in improving the prognosis of patients with severe burn."

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

The risk factors of pneumonia in convalescent patients who have experienced stroke remain poorly defined. METHODS: To identify the risk factors of pneumonia, we applied logistic regression as a statistical method using SPSS23.0 statistical software, based on a sample of 380 patients. And statistical description method was used to analyze pathogens' characteristics and drug resistance. RESULTS: Ultimately, the obtained logistic model has statistical significance (chi2(13) = 91.560, P <0.0005). The sensitivity of the model is 41.7%, the specificity is 97.6%, the positive predictive value is 76.9%, and the negative predictive value is 89.8%. The Barthel index (BI) (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.01-3.87), basic lung diseases (OR=4.24, 95% CI: 1.02-17.61), trachea ventilation (OR=6.56, 95% CI: 1.18-36.34), feeding tube (OR=6.06, 95% CI: 2.59-14.18), and hypoproteinemia (OR=3.97, 95% CI: 1.56-10.10) were statistically significant (P<0.05). Among patients who have pneumonia, the proportion of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungal infection is 10.00%, 54.29%, 5.71% respectively. The study most frequently isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.57%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.00%,) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.00%). The drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae to different antibiotics ranged from 0.00-37.77%, 0.00-85.71% and 0.00-57.14%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The lower BI scores, basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are independent risk factors of pneumonia among convalescent patients with stroke. The main pathogens that caused pneumonia were gram-negative bacteria, and such organisms have different degrees of resistance to drugs."

The emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB) has become a public health problem, creating a new burden on medical care in hospitals, particularly for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). AIM: To describe risk factors for ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) in patients with cancer and to evaluate the impact of MDRB. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed from January 2016 to December 2018 at a cancer referral center in Mexico City, which included all patients who were admitted to the ICU and required MV >= 48 h. They were classified as those who developed VAP versus those who did not; pathogens isolated, including MDRB. Clinical evolution at 60-d was assessed. Descriptive analysis was carried out; comparison was performed between VAP vs non-VAP and MDRB vs non-MDRB. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three patients were included in the study; mean age was 51.9 years; 52.1% were male; 68.4% had solid tumors. There were 32 episodes of VAP with a rate of 12.2%; 11.5 episodes/1000 ventilation-days. The most frequent bacteria isolated were the following: Klebsiella spp. [n = 9, four were Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producers, one was Carbapenem-resistant (CR)]; Escherichia coli (n = 5, one was ESBL), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8, two were CR). One Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was identified. In multivariate analysis, the sole risk factor associated for VAP was length of ICU stay (OR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.03-1.17; P = 0.003). Sixty-day mortality was 53% in VAP and 43% without VAP (P = 0.342). There was not higher mortality in those patients with MDRB. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the high percentage of Gram-negative bacteria, which allows the initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage for these pathogens. In this retrospective, single center, observational study, MDRB VAP was not directly linked to increased mortality at 60 days."

We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure. RESULTS: From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the predictors of co-infection together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia."

The PES score was developed in 2015 to predict the microbiological etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (PES microorganisms). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate the usefulness of the PES score for predicting PES microorganisms in two cohorts of patients with CAP from Valencia and Mataro. METHODS: We analyzed two prospective observational cohorts of patients with CAP from Valencia and Mataro. Patients in the Mataro cohort were all admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Of the 1,024 patients in the Valencia cohort, 505(51%) had a microbiological etiology and 31(6%) had a PES microorganism isolated. The AUC was 0.81. For a PES score >=5, sensitivity, specificity, the negative and positive predictive values as well as the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 72%, 74%, 98%, 14%, 0.38, and 2.75, respectively. Of the 299 patients in the Mataro cohort, 213(71%) had a microbiological etiology and 11(5%) had a PES microorganism isolated. The AUC was 0.73. For a PES score >=5, sensitivity, specificity, the negative and positive predictive values, as well as the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 36%, 83%, 96%, 11%, 0.77, and 2.09, respectively. The best cut-off for patients admitted to ICU was 4 points, which improved sensitivity to 86%. The hypothetical application of the PES score showed high rates of overtreatment in both cohorts (26% and 35%, respectively) and similar rates of under-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The PES score showed good accuracy in predicting the risk for microorganisms that required different empirical therapy; however, its use as a single strategy for detecting non-core pathogens could lead to high rates of overtreatment. Given its high negative predictive value, PES score may be used as a first step of a wider strategy that includes subsequent advanced diagnostic tests."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%. The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem increased annually. The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones, Aminoglycosides were <5% even when compared to carbapenems. Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

The aim of the study was to analyze the microbial factors of HAIs and the drug resistance of microorganisms to selected antibiotics and their consumption. Material and Methods: The retrospective study included 3708 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Teaching Hospital in Wroclaw, who were diagnosed with 742 HAIs in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018. The aim of the study was the analysis of microorganisms isolated in the respective clinical forms of HAIs, including the occurrence of ""alert pathogens"", presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and consumption of selected antibiotics. Findings: During the study period, 846 microorganisms were cultured in patients with HAIs, and among them, Acinetobacter baumannii MDR represented 31.8%; Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBLs, 11.3%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR, 4.1% and MRSA, 2.2%; and Enterococcus spp. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 1.3%. Among all the pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were dominant (71.6%). Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 21.6% and 7%, respectively. The total number of strains responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central line-associated blood stream infection (CLA-BSI) was as follows: 458 (54.1%), 274 (32.4%), and 114 (13.5%), respectively. Among the etiological factors of VAP, there was a prevalence of A. baumannii MDR (41.9%), as well as in the case of UTI (21.9%). With regards to CLA-BSI, MRCNS (29.8%) was the dominant pathogen. The ""alert pathogens"" accounted for 54.7% of all the analyzed strains. The MDR strains represented 72.6% and 9.7% among A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In the years 2011 vs. 2018, an increase in infections with MDR bacilli was observed, 34.6% vs. 61.0% (p = 0.0008), respectively, including A. baumannii MDR 16.54% vs. 34.56 % (p = 0.0009) and Enterobacterales ESBL+/AMPC 11.8% vs. 15.44 % (p = 0.3921). Resistance to methicillin was confirmed in 35.2% of S. aureus strains. Resistance to vancomycin was found among 30.9% of Enterococcus spp. The observed period was marked by an increase in the consumption of carbapenems: 197.7 vs. 235.9 defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patients-days. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be dominant pathogens in healthcare-associated infections. The most frequently cultured pathogens were multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae ESBL(+), and P. aeruginosa. The study showed an increase in the incidence of ""alert pathogens"" and MDR bacilli, as well as the tendency of a growing resistance to antibiotics during the observed period.

However, little is known about mortality due to hospital-acquired infections in cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the cardiac surgery unit of a university hospital. All patients who underwent cardiac surgery over a 7-year period were included. Patients with hospital-acquired infections were matched 1:1 with patients with nonhospital-acquired infections based on risk factors for hospital-acquired infections and death after cardiac surgery using propensity score matching. We performed a competitive risk analysis to study the mortality fraction due to hospital-acquired infections. RESULTS: Of 8853 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, 370 (4.2%) developed 500 postoperative infections (incidence density rate 4.2 hospital-acquired infections per 1000 patient-days). Crude hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with hospital-acquired infections than in matched patients who did not develop hospital-acquired infections, 15.4% and 5.7%, respectively (P < .001). The in-hospital mortality fraction due to hospital-acquired infections in our cohort was 17.1% (12.3%-22.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (hazard ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.49; P = .005), bloodstream infection (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.63; P = .010), and pneumonia (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.77; P = .04) were each independently associated with increased hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although hospital-acquired infections are relatively uncommon after cardiac surgery (4.2%), these infections have a major impact on postoperative mortality (attributable mortality fraction, 17.1%)."

Liver cirrhosis (OR 3.120 (95% CI 1.436-6.780)) and six other variables were independent predictors of MDR. Acinetobacter baumannii (25.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12.6%) were the most common pathogens (MDR prevalence 64.9%). Isolates from VAP patients showed more A. baumannii and less K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains (p < 0.001, respectively) than those from patients without VAP. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains decreased; that of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and Enterobacterales strains increased.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to develop combination antibiograms to assess the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa in respiratory cultures to combinations of empiric antibiotics and to use combination antibiograms to delineate the impact of specific risk factors for which guidelines recommend dual antipseudomonal therapy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of adults hospitalized with pneumonia with positive respiratory cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa between September 2014 and September 2018. Data collected included demographics, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and risk factors for which guidelines recommend dual antipseudomonal therapy. Combination antibiograms were developed and logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for non-susceptibility to beta-lactams. RESULTS: Eight hundred and nineteen patients were included and 72% received antibiotics. Beta-lactam susceptibility ranged from 58% to 69% and addition of a fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside resulted in statistically significant increases in susceptibility. However, only addition of tobramycin or amikacin provided susceptibility rates approaching or exceeding 90% stratified by pneumonia type and risk factors. Presence of guideline-based risk factors generally resulted in reduced susceptibility rates. Logistic regression identified three risk factors associated with non-susceptibility to beta-lactams: intravenous antibiotics in previous 90 days, nursing home residence, and mechanical ventilation at onset. The cumulative presence of each additional risk factor affected beta-lactam susceptibility rates, which were 93% in the absence of any risk factors and 39% when all three risk factors co-existed. CONCLUSION: Risk factors necessitating dual antipseudomonal therapy for pneumonia should be locally validated. When dual antipseudomonal therapy is indicated, tobramycin or amikacin have the best likelihood of providing adequate in vitro activity."

We performed a prospective single-center study in 43 critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in which we performed 96 FA-PP tests and cultures of blind bronchoalveolar lavage (BBAL). FA-PP detected 1 or more pathogens in 32% (31/96 of samples), whereas culture methods detected at least 1 pathogen in 35% (34/96 of samples). The most prevalent bacteria detected were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 11) on both FA-PP and culture. The FA-PP results from BBAL in critically ill patients with COVID-19 were consistent with bacterial culture findings for bacteria present in the FA-PP panel, showing sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of 95%, 99%, 82%, and 100%, respectively. Median turnaround time for FA-PP was 5.5 h, which was significantly shorter than for standard culture (26 h) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results (57 h)."

METHODS: For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. CONCLUSION: The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed."

The type III secretion system (T3SS) is one of its main determinants of virulence and is associated with poor clinical progression and increased mortality. This study determined the relationship of clinical features of patients with CF and P. aeruginosa T3SS virulotypes. Materials and Methods: From January 2018 to March 2019, P. aeruginosa were isolated from sputum and/or oropharyngeal swabs. T3SS markers (exoS, exoU, exoT and exoY) were detected by PCR. Clinical severity according to Shwachman-Kulckycki score and spirometry data were associated with T3SS virulotypes. Results: A total of 49 patients had positive cultures for P. aeruginosa. T3SS virulence-related markers were detected as follows: exoS 97.9% (n=48), exoU 63.2% (n=31), exoT 95.9% (n=47) and exoY 97.9% (n=48). The prevalence of exoS+/exoU+ virulotype was higher than previously reported in CF settings, being detected in 61.2% of the evaluated isolates, present in 70% of intermittent infections and with a significantly higher frequency in cases of exacerbations. The presence of exoU in chronic infection was not associated with poor clinical results. In chronic infections, the exoS+/exoU- virulotype prevailed (77.8%) and was associated to worse clinical results according to the Shwachman-Kulckycki score and spirometric. Conclusion: Our findings revealed a high prevalence of the atypical exoS+/exoU+ virulotype among P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with CF, which was associated with intermittent infection and early clinical alterations, while the exoS+/exoU- virulotype was associated with chronic infection and worse clinical results. Finally, the presented data highlight the relevance of T3SS virulence markers in the clinical progression and disease severity in CF patients."

A complete blood count, serum biochemistry, thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasound were performed. Initially, aspiration pneumonia was suspected owing to an alveolar lung pattern in the right cranial ventral lung lobes seen on radiographs. The cat did not improve with empirical antibiotic therapy. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. An intraluminal tracheal mass was identified and removed via endoscopic guidance and gentle traction. Histopathology results were consistent with a fibrinous tracheal pseudomembrane. The cat was concurrently diagnosed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also cultured within the pseudomembrane. The cat was received antimicrobial therapy for his Pseudomonas pneumonia. In humans, fibrinous tracheal pseudomembranes occur uncommonly as a complication following endotracheal intubation and rarely due to infectious organisms. As there was no prior history of endotracheal intubation, the development of fibrinous tracheal pseudomembrane in this cat was suspected to be secondary to Pseudonomas aeruginosa aspiration pneumonia. Relevance and novel information: The present case report is the first to describe a tracheal pseudomembrane in a cat. Bronchoscopy-guided gentle traction and subsequent removal of the tracheal pseudomembrane resulted in a complete resolution of the clinical signs."

An Observational Study.ABSTRACT:Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a well-known complication of patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. The main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is pneumonia. ARDS can occur in patients with community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia. Data regarding ARDS incidence, related pathogens, and specific outcomes in patients with VAP is limited. This is a cohort study in which patients with VAP were evaluated in an 800-bed tertiary teaching hospital between 2004 and 2016. Clinical outcomes, microbiological and epidemiological data were assessed among those who developed ARDS and those who did not. Forty-one (13.6%) out of 301 VAP patients developed ARDS. Patients who developed ARDS were younger and presented with higher prevalence of chronic liver disease. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, but without any difference between groups. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was prescribed to ARDS patients as frequently as to those without ARDS. Ninety-day mortality did not significantly vary among patients with or without ARDS. Additionally, patients with ARDS did not have significantly higher intensive care unit (ICU) and 28-day mortality, ICU, and hospital length of stay, ventilation-free days, and duration of mechanical ventilation. In summary, ARDS deriving from VAP occurs in 13.6% of patients. Although significant differences in clinical outcomes were not observed between both groups, further studies with a higher number of patients are needed due to the possibility of the study being underpowered."

We performed this retrospective cohort study to assess frequency, clinical characteristics, responsible pathogens, and outcomes of VAP in patients COVID-19 pneumonia requiring MV between March 12th and April 24th, 2020 (all had RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection). Patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ECMO were compared with an historical cohort of 45 patients with severe influenza-associated ARDS requiring ECMO admitted to the same ICU during the preceding three winter seasons. RESULTS: Among 50 consecutive patients with Covid-19-associated ARDS requiring ECMO included [median (IQR) age 48 (42-56) years; 72% male], 43 (86%) developed VAP [median (IQR) MV duration before the first episode, 10 (8-16) days]. VAP-causative pathogens were predominantly Enterobacteriaceae (70%), particularly inducible AmpC-cephalosporinase producers (40%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37%). VAP recurred in 34 (79%) patients and 17 (34%) died. Most recurrences were relapses (i.e., infection with the same pathogen), with a high percentage occurring on adequate antimicrobial treatment. Estimated cumulative incidence of VAP, taking into account death and extubation as competing events, was significantly higher in Covid-19 patients than in influenza patients (p = 0.002). Despite a high P. aeruginosa-VAP rate in patients with influenza-associated ARDS (54%), the pulmonary infection recurrence rate was significantly lower than in Covid-19 patients. Overall mortality was similar for the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe Covid-19-associated ARDS requiring ECMO had a very high late-onset VAP rate. Inducible AmpC-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently caused VAP, with multiple recurrences and difficulties eradicating the pathogen from the lung."

METHODS: Biofilm production was tested to assess biomass production and metabolic activity using crystal violet binding assay and XTT assay, respectively. Pigment production (pyocyanin and pyoverdine) was evaluated using cetrimide agar. Virulence genes were detected by conventional multiplex PCR and virulence was tested in an in vivo model in Galleria mellonella larvae. RESULTS: We did not find statistically significant differences between VAP and no-VAP strains (p > 0.05) regarding biofilm production. VAP strains had no production of pyocyanin after 24 h of incubation (p = 0.023). The distribution of virulence genes between both groups were similar (p > 0.05). VAP strains were less virulent than non-VAP strains in an in vivo model of G. mellonella (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The virulence of VAP-Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not depend on biofilm formation, production of pyoverdine or the presence of some virulence genes compared to P. aeruginosa isolated from non-invasive locations. However, VAP strains showed attenuated virulence compared to non-VAP strains in an in vivo model of G. mellonella."

Methods: Non-duplicated nosocomial cases as well as pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from 11 teaching hospitals across China were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clinically significant strains were determined by agar dilution method or broth microdilution method. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S29 criteria were used for interpretation, and the WHONET-5.6 software was used in data analysis. Results: A total of 1 590 cases were collected, including 831 cases from BSI, 450 cases from HAP and 309 cases from IAI. The most prevalent pathogens causing BSI were Escherichia coli (29.2%, 243/831), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%, 135/831) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%, 84/831); the most prevalent pathogens causing IAI were E. coli (26.2%, 81/309), Enterococcus faecium (15.5%, 48/309) and K. pneumoniae (13.3%, 41/309); while Acinetobacter baumanii (24.7%, 111/450), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.7%, 93/450) and K. pneumoniae (16.2%, 73/450) were dominated in HAP. All S. aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides; 77.8% (105/135) of S. aureus strains were susceptible to ceftaroline. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 29.6% (40/135) of all the S. aureus, and was lower than the accounted rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) (83.7%, 41/49). One E. faecium strain (1.1%, 1/95) resistant to vacomycin and teicoplanin and one E. faecalis strain (2.3%, 1/43) resistant to linezolid was found. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 56.1% (193/344) in E. coli and 22.1% (55/249) in K. pneumonia; the rate of carbapenem resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 4.1% (14/344) and 22.9% (57/249), respectively; the percentage of ceftazidime/avibactam resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 2.3% (8/344) and 2.0% (5/249), respectively; the percentage of colistin resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia was 1.5% (5/344) and 7.6% (19/249), respectively; no E. coli and K. pneumonia strains were found resistant to tigecycline. The rate of carbapenem resistant A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa were 78.9% (146/185) and 36.7% (66/180), respectively. A. baumanii showed low susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents except colistin (99.5%, 184/185) and tigecycline (91.4%, 169/185). Colistin, amikacin and ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa with susceptility rate of 100% (180/180), 93.3% (168/180) and 85.6% (154/180), respectively. Conclusions: Nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens show high susceptibilities to tigecycline, colistin and ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro. Antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii is a serious problem. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has increased, which should be monitored continuously in China."

We aimed to determine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, and the incidence of VA-LRTI. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective European cohort performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation > 48 h were eligible if they had: SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, or no viral infection at ICU admission. VA-LRTI, including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), were diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. All VA-LRTI were prospectively identified, and chest-X rays were analyzed by at least two physicians. Cumulative incidence of first episodes of VA-LRTI was estimated using the Kalbfleisch and Prentice method, and compared using Fine-and Gray models. RESULTS: 1576 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2, 482 in influenza, and 526 in no viral infection groups). VA-LRTI incidence was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients (287, 50.5%), as compared to influenza patients (146, 30.3%, adjusted sub hazard ratio (sHR) 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 2.04)) or patients with no viral infection (133, 25.3%, adjusted sHR 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.39)). Gram-negative bacilli were responsible for a large proportion (82% to 89.7%) of VA-LRTI, mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VA-LRTI is significantly higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as compared to patients with influenza pneumonia, or no viral infection after statistical adjustment, but residual confounding may still play a role in the effect estimates."

The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination."

Hypermutable (HPM) P. aeruginosa isolates have been described in these patients and are usually associated with antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of carbapenem resistance and hypermutable phenotype in 179 P. aeruginosa isolates from 8 chronically CF patients assisted at two reference centers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Using disk diffusion test, non-susceptible (NS) rates higher than 40% were observed for imipenem, amikacin, and gentamicin. A total of 79 isolates (44.1%), 71 (39.6%), and 8 (4.4%) were classified as carbapenem-resistant (CR resistance to at least one carbapenem), multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR), respectively. Minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for 79 CR P. aeruginosa and showed the following variations: 4 and 128 mug/mL to imipenem, 4 and 64 microg/mL to meropenem, and 4 and >= 32 microg/mL to doripenem. We have found only four (2.23%) HPM isolates from 4 patients. Analyzing the genetic relationship among the HPM isolates, 3 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis/pulsotypes (D, M, and J) were observed. Only M pulsotype was recovered from two patients in different years. Polymerase chain reaction screening for blaGES, blaIMP, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA-48, blaSPM, and blaVIM genes was performed for all CR isolates and none of them were positive.

AIM: To determine and analyze the incidence, risk factors and etiologic agents of NI in newborns admitted in the NICU to help plan-ning future surveillance and prevention strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out at the NICU of St George University Hospital, Plovdiv, Bul-garia from January 1, 2017 to June 31, 2018. The number of neonates included in the study was 507. Descriptive statistics such as count,  percent, mean and standard deviation was used. Chi-square test was performed to prove associations. Odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were computed from the results of the binominal logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 507 hospitalized newborns in NICU, 48 presented with 54 NI. The incidence and the density incidence rates were 9.5% and 7.67 per 1,000 patient-days, respectively. Nosocomial infections were detected in neonates from all birth weight (BW) classes, but it was low BW and premature neonates that were at major risk to acquire them. The most common infection sites were ventilator-asso-ciated pneumonia (VAP) (67.27%), bloodstream infection (23.64%) and conjunctivitis (9.09%). Major pathogens were Gram-negative such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis NIs were strongly associated with intubation, presence of a venous catheter, the duration of antibiotic treatment and increased CRP> 10 mg/l.

The following micro-organisms were isolated: P. aeruginosa in 41 cases, P. fluorescens in three cases, Xanthomonas maltophilia (P. maltophilia) in two cases, P. putida in one case. Comamonas testosteronis (P. testosteronis) and Comamonas acidovorans (P. acidovorans) in one case. Amikacin and ceftazidime, alone or in combination, appear to be the optimal choice of therapy for severe Pseudomonas infections in HIV-infected patients, although in our study six of 47 isolates were resistant in vitro to amikacin, and nine of 31 isolates were resistant to ceftazidime."

Out of the 54 patients studied, 53 were evaluable for the utility of IPM/CS; 42 had pneumonia, 9 had obstructive pneumonia, 1 had a lung abscess and 1 had acute bronchitis. The efficacy rate was 71.7%. Seventeen causative organisms were isolated from 14 patients. They included Staphylococcus aureus 5 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 4 strains, Staphylococcus sp. 2 strains, Enterococcus faecalis 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 strains, Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 strains, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain, and the eradication rate was 81.8%. Clinical adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) were observed in 1 patient. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 3 patients. They disappeared or returned to normal values after completion of therapy or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for RTI in patients with lung cancer."

From September to December 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. The blood samples for PCR analysis (SeptiFast technique Roche diagnostics, Switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. Among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. The species structure of identified germs was as follows: Enteroccocus Faecalis - 2, Klebsiella pneumonia - 2, Enteroccocusfaecium - 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative Staphilococcus - 11. All cases of seeding of coagulase negative Staphilococcus were interpreted using PCR techniques as negative or contamination. In four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. In cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the PCR techniques permitted to detect two positive results (Staphilococcus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). In three cases of positive hemoculture the PCR techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. The PCR techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. This techniques has to be applied in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations."

In this report, we provide the first genomic analysis of P. fluorescens strains in which human vs. environmental isolates are compared. RESULTS: Seven P. fluorescens strains were isolated from respiratory samples from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The clinical strains could grow at a higher temperature (&gt;34  C) than has been reported for environmental strains. Draft genomes were generated for all of the clinical strains, and multi-locus sequence analysis placed them within subclade III of the P. fluorescens species-complex. All strains encoded type- II, -III, -IV, and -VI secretion systems, as well as the widespread colonization island (WCI). This is the first description of a WCI in P. fluorescens strains. All strains also encoded a complete I2/PfiT locus and showed evidence of horizontal gene transfer. The clinical strains were found to differ from the environmental strains in the number of genes involved in metal resistance, which may be a possible adaptation to chronic antibiotic exposure in the CF lung. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest comparative genomics analysis of P. fluorescens subclade III strains to date and includes the first clinical isolates. At a global level, the clinical P. fluorescens subclade III strains were largely indistinguishable from environmental P. fluorescens subclade III strains, supporting the idea that identifying strains as 'environmental' vs 'clinical' is not a phenotypic trait. Rather, strains within P. fluorescens subclade III will colonize and persist in any niche that provides the requirements necessary for growth."

Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida.

Arbekacin, a relatively new aminoglycoside, is effective against Pseudomonas spp. in vitro. However, no clinical report on arbekacin treatment of a human infection with a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas has appeared to date. We encountered a case of pneumonia caused by a Pseudomonas strain producing a metallo-beta-lactamase; the patient was successfully treated with arbekacin. A 69-year-old male presented to our hospital experiencing cardiac arrest after rescue from water. Spontaneous circulation had earlier resumed after brief application of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patient was subjected to induced hypothermia. He experienced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient regained consciousness on day 8 post-admission. Episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia were recorded on days 5 and 12. The causative organism was a strain of Pseudomonas putida that produced a metallo-beta-lactamase. Combination therapy with arbekacin and levofloxacin successfully resolved the pneumonia. The patient was transferred to another hospital on day 37 to undergo further rehabilitation. Strains of P. putida producing metallo-beta-lactamases have become more widespread in recent years. Colistin is traditionally the drug of last resort to treat infections with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas. However, colistin use is associated with a very high frequency of adverse effects, and the costs of such therapy are not covered by the Japanese health insurance system. Our results indicate that arbekacin is an efficient alternative to multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas. "

METHODS: The complete nucleotide sequence of p12969-DIM was determined with a paired-end library and a mate-pair library using next-generation sequencing technology. RESULTS: blaDIM-2, a close blaDIM-1 variant, was identified in p12969-DIM. DIM-2 differs from DIM-1 by two amino acid substitutions Ser119Leu and Ser209Pro. The p12969-DIM backbone is highly similar to pOZ176, but the IncP-2-type stability/replication/conjugal transfer system in the pOZ176 backbone is absent from p12969-DIM. The p12969-DIM accessory regions, a 45.7 kb MDR and a novel insertion sequence, ISPpu23, are almost entirely distinct from pOZ176. The MDR region contains a novel Tn21-subgroup transposon Tn6286 inserted with two class 1 integrons, In1225 and In1226; a Tn5503-family transposon-like element inserted with a strAB locus; and a novel Tn21-subgroup transposon-like element inserted with a class 1 integron, In1224. The three integrons carry blaDIM-2 as well as a number of additional genes conferring resistance to quinolones, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, trimethoprim, streptomycin, quaternary ammonium compounds and sulphonamides. p12969-DIM has two distinct replication/stability systems, repA/parAB-parB2 of an unknown incompatibility group in the backbone and repABC/mazFE of the IncQ2 group in the MDR region.

The clinical implication of such environmental GNBs is unknown. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review to determine how often such saprophytic GNBs cause human infections. Methods: We queried PubMed for articles published in English, Spanish, and French between January 2006 and July 2014 for 20 common environmental saprophytic GNB species, using search terms ""infections,"" ""human infections,"" ""hospital infection."" We analyzed 251 of 1,275 non-duplicate publications that satisfied our selection criteria. Saprophytes implicated in blood stream infection (BSI), urinary tract infection (UTI), skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), post-surgical infection (PSI), osteomyelitis (Osteo), and pneumonia (PNA) were quantitatively assessed. Results: Thirteen of the 20 queried GNB saprophytic species were implicated in 674 distinct infection episodes from 45 countries. The most common species included Enterobacter aerogenes, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas putida. Of these infections, 443 (66%) had BSI, 48 (7%) had SSTI, 36 (5%) had UTI, 28 (4%) had PSI, 21 (3%) had PNA, 16 (3%) had Osteo, and 82 (12%) had other infections. Nearly all infections occurred in subjects with comorbidities. Resistant strains harbored extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and metallo-beta-lactamase genes recognized in human pathogens. Conclusion: These observations show that saprophytic GNB organisms that harbor recognized drug-resistance genes cause a wide spectrum of infections, especially as opportunistic pathogens. Such GNB saprophytes may become increasingly more common in healthcare settings, as has already been observed with other environmental GNBs such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa."

A new pacing device was inserted on the contrlateral pectoral region. Ciprofloxacin enabled full recovery. A literature review concerning this pathogen revealed that it is involved in severe infections such as bloodstream infections, peritonitis, cellulitis, pneumonia and lung abscesses, and urinary tract infections. In these case reports, underlying co-morbidities were identified such as solid active neoplasia, recent chemotherapy, corticosteroids, solid-organ-recipient patients and recent open surgery. Conclusion.R. planticola is a serious emerging pathogen and contributes to the burden of various infectious conditions. Its pathogenicity and occurrence should be known by clinicians and a high level of awareness is necessary to precisely identify it provide the correct antibiotic regimen."

The organism remains a rare cause of human infection with a few cases reported in the literature. However, since its description in 1981 there have been increasing rates of infections caused by R. planticola with reports of conjunctivitis, liver abscess, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. More concerning are reports of carbapenemase-producing isolates which have led to the only 2 mortalities associated with R. planticola infections. To our knowledge, we report the third case of R. planticola pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient with no known direct exposure to the reported risk factors."

Methods: In 2010, during the therapy for a 51 years old patient, clinical and environmental samples were collected for carbapenem resistant bacterial culture, according to the clinical microbiological examination. Strains identification and antibiotic susceptibility were tested by VITEK Compact 2 system and E-test. The bla(NDM-1) was detected by PCR and analyzed by sequencing. Plasmids containing bla(NDM-1) were submitted to PFGE-S1 and Southern hybridization. Results: During hospitalization from October 1st to November 4th, nine strains were isolated from blood, sputum, urine, fecal, and ward ground samples. The Klebsiella oxytoca, Raoultella planticola, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from blood sample. The Klebsiella pneumonia and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from sputum sample. An Acinetobacter lwoffii was isolated from urine sample. An Escherichia coli was isolated from fecal sample. And the Acinetobacter lwoffii and Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from ward ground. Four strains were NDM-1 positive, which were Raoultella planticola (RpNDM1) isolated from blood, Escherichia coli (EcNDM1) isolated from fecal, Acinetobacter lwoffii (AlDNM1) and Acinetobacter spp. (AsNDM1) isolated from ward ground. Four NDM-1 positive strains were resistant to Piperacillin, Piperacillin tazobactam, Cefepime, Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime, Imipenem, Meropenem, and Ertapenem. Southern hybridization revealed that bla(NDM-1) were all located on plasmids in the four positive strains. Conclusion:bla(NDM-1) can transfer rapidly among different species, resulting in difficult to control and prevent. While isolating patient who is carrying NDM-1 positive strains, more attention should be paid to the disposal of patient's excreta, especially stool, should be paid more attention."

Septic shock from R. planticola after burn injury has not been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old male was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit after extensive flame burn injury. He accidently caught fire while burning trash and plunged into a nearby tank filled with contaminated rainwater to extinguish the fire. The patient developed septic shock on day 10. The blood culture detected R. planticola, which was identified using the VITEK-2 biochemical identification system. Although appropriate antibiotic treatment was continued, the patient died on day 12.

Although in recent years the frequency of R. planticola infections reported in the literature has increased, few cases of pneumonia caused by R. planticola have been described. Here, we investigate the clinical characteristics, management, and clinical outcomes of pneumonia caused by R. planticola. Methods: Consecutive patients with pneumonia caused by R. planticola were included. The medical records of patients with R. planticola pneumonia treated at Dankook University Hospital from January 2011 to December 2017 were collected. Results: A total of 11 adult patients with R. planticola pneumonia were diagnosed and treated [10 males and 1 female; median age, 70 years (range: 51-79 years)]; 5 patients had underlying malignant conditions (45.5%). Antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that all isolates of R. planticola were susceptible to cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors. Chest imaging revealed consolidation (8/11, 72.7%), ground-glass opacity (5/11, 45.5%), pleural effusion (5/11, 45.5%), and micronodules (3/11, 27.3%). Four patients (36.4%) required mechanical ventilation; three survived but one died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (principally pneumonia and septic shock). Conclusions: R. planticola pneumonia occurred mainly in patients with underlying risk factors such as malignant disease, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The organism was sensitive to most antibiotics, and the clinical outcomes were favorable after empirical antibiotic therapy."

METHODS: the clinical and microbiological data were analyzed for patients proved to have Rhizobium radiobacter infection by blood culture obtained from May 2008 to July 2009 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Related literature were reviewed. RESULTS: there were 4 males and 2 females aging 5 - 88 years old. All the patients suffered from fever and chillsor malaise, and had increased peripheral WBC or neutrophil count. The majority (5/6) of the infections was pneumonia, characterized by mild cough and expectoration, lung rales, patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. All the patients had underlying diseases or were immunocompromised. Five of the 6 patients had close soil exposure. Four of the 6 patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive therapy. Antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that, all the isolates of Rhizobium radiobacter were susceptible to the third generation cephalosporins, cephamycins, Carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin and some of the aminoglycosides, but resistant to penicillins, penicillins/enzyme inhibitors, first and fourth generation cephalosporins, and helices beta-lactamase antibiotics. There were no complications, and all patients recovered uneventfully after treatment with antibiotics according to the susceptibility testing.

We characterized the symptoms and outcome of all CMV infections in a large cohort of kidney transplant recipients. Among 1129 kidney transplant recipients transplanted between 2004 and 2011 in Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin and Helsinki University Hospital, 297 patients with CMV infection were characterized. RESULTS: CMV disease occurred in 217/1129 patients (19.2%), and CMV infection in 297/1129 (26.3%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded in 58% and fever in 47% patients with primary CMV disease, compared to 46% and 27% patients with symptomatic CMV reactivation, whereas leukopenia or thrombocytopenia were seen in only 17-28% patients, and malaise in 9-10%. Tissue-invasive CMV gastroenteritis was confirmed in 11% and CMV pneumonia in only 1% of patients with CMV disease. Only 1 patient died because of CMV infection (mortality 0.3%). Virus-related factors or the use of secondary prophylaxis did not predict the risk of recurrence, which occurred in 33% patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CMV disease remains a common problem after kidney transplantation. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common, especially in patients with primary CMV infection, whereas bone marrow suppression, hepatopathy, or malaise were seen less frequently."

Putative pathogens were identified in 323 (37%) patients, the most common being Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A (117), Rickettsia typhi (97), Streptococcus pneumoniae (53), Leptospira spp. (36), and Orientia tsutsugamushi (28). Approximately half of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. No clinical predictors were identified to reliably distinguish between the different infections. These findings confirm the heavy burden of enteric fever and pneumonia in Kathmandu, and highlight the importance of murine typhus, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis.

Nepal is one of many resource-poor nations with limited information on the epidemiology of childhood infections caused by these pathogens. METHODS: Over a 21-month period, we studied children aged &lt;=12 years admitted to an urban hospital in Nepal with suspected bacteremia, meningitis, or pneumonia. Patan Hospital is a non-profit hospital with the second largest pediatric unit in the Kathmandu Valley. RESULTS: Of 2039 children enrolled in the study, 142 (7.5%) included in the analysis had positive blood cultures. The agents of enteric fever, Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, accounted for 59/142 (42%) of all bacteremias and were the most frequently cultured pathogens in children &gt;=1 year of age. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 16% of positive blood cultures and was the most common cause of bacteremia in children &lt;1 year of age. Pneumonia accounted for 51% of admissions in children &gt;=2 months, with 44% of these children having radiographically defined primary endpoint pneumonia. S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified pathogen in cases of pneumonia and meningitis. The S. pneumoniae serotype distribution indicated that the 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines would cover 44% and 47%, respectively, of all S. pneumoniae cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolates and 62% and 67%, respectively, of isolates associated with pneumonia. H. influenzae type b was isolated infrequently from blood or CSF cultures, but is likely to be more important as a cause of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The data on the burden of invasive bacterial infections and pneumonia from this study suggest that vaccines in development against Salmonella Typhi and the pneumococcus have the potential to significantly improve the health of children in Nepal."

Here we present a severe case of Salmonella typhi infection complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old male presented with shortness of breath, generalized body aches and upper abdominal pain two weeks after returning from India. Investigations revealed severe metabolic acidosis (arterial blood pH 6.9), high serum creatinine (12.7 mg/dl), hyperuricemia (16.4 mg/dl), hypocalcemia (4.1 mg/dl), hyperphosphatemia (16.1 mg/dl), high serum amylase (1458 u/L), thrombocytopenia (59,000/mm3) and disturbed coagulation profile. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was confirmed by an elevated creatine phosphokinase level of 17,000 U/L. The patient was started on hemodialysis, and two days later he developed broncho-pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Blood cultures grew Salmonella typhi; parenteral imipenem-cilastin and ciprofloxacin were initiated. After one week, the patient continued to have fever despite improvement of biochemical parameters and negative blood and stool cultures. Antibiotic drug-fever was suspected and antibiotics were stopped. Subsequently, fever and rash disappeared and the patient was switched to ceftazidime two days later. The patient eventually regained normal kidney function but continued to have weakness in both lower limbs. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies revealed diffuse axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy that progressively improved over time. CONCLUSION: Common infective agents, including salmonella typhi, can present in unusual ways. The possibility of a severe systemic infection being the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis should not be overlooked.

Eight patients (73%) were 60 years old or older, and the median age was in the seventh decade. There was no seasonal variation in the prevalence. The infection was hospital acquired in 4 patients (36%). All patients had one or more (median, 1.5) major underlying diseases. Seven of them had previous abnormalities of the lung or pleura. Severe immunosuppression was present in 7 cases. Pneumonia occurred in 8 patients, lung abscesses in 2, and empyema in 1. All patients with pneumonia had positive blood cultures. A gastrointestinal source of pulmonary infection was not probable because only 2 patients had positive stool cultures. We suggest that the reticulo-endothelial system could be the source of hematogenous spread of nontyphoid Salmonella. The overall mortality was 63%. Pulmonary infection due to Salmonella should be considered among the pathogens associated with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in elderly patients who are immunosuppressed and have underlying pulmonary disease. Pathogenesis of this infection remains to be clarified."

","SPECIES:Salmonella entericaID:25909750TITLE:Rapid emergence of multidrug resistant, H58-lineage Salmonella typhi in Blantyre, Malawi.ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Between 1998 and 2010, S. Typhi was an uncommon cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in Blantyre, Malawi and it was usually susceptible to first-line antimicrobial therapy. In 2011 an increase in a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain was detected through routine bacteriological surveillance conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH). METHODS: Longitudinal trends in culture-confirmed Typhoid admissions at QECH were described between 1998-2014. A retrospective review of patient cases notes was conducted, focusing on clinical presentation, prevalence of HIV and case-fatality. Isolates of S. Typhi were sequenced and the phylogeny of Typhoid in Blantyre was reconstructed and placed in a global context. RESULTS: Between 1998-2010, there were a mean of 14 microbiological diagnoses of Typhoid/year at QECH, of which 6.8% were MDR. This increased to 67 in 2011 and 782 in 2014 at which time 97% were MDR. The disease predominantly affected children and young adults (median age 11 [IQR 6-21] in 2014). The prevalence of HIV in adult patients was 16.7% [8/48], similar to that of the general population (17.8%). Overall, the case fatality rate was 2.5% (3/94). Complications included anaemia, myocarditis, pneumonia and intestinal perforation. 112 isolates were sequenced and the phylogeny demonstrated the introduction and clonal expansion of the H58 lineage of S. Typhi. CONCLUSIONS: Since 2011, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of multidrug resistant, H58-lineage Typhoid in Blantyre. This is one of a number of reports of the re-emergence of Typhoid in Southern and Eastern Africa. There is an urgent need to understand the reservoirs and transmission of disease and how to arrest this regional increase."

She was successfully treated with antibiotics, pleural decortication and splenectomy. She had presented with fever after being treated for presumed pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion 2 months prior. CT scan showed splenic abscesses eroding through the diaphragm causing a left pleural empyema. Pleural fluid and spleen bacterial cultures grew Salmonella enterica. She was treated with 4 weeks of antibiotics and underwent surgical pleural decortication and splenectomy in the same sitting. She made a good postoperative recovery. Patients with severe iron overload are susceptible to various types of bacterial sepsis, including salmonellosis. It is unusual for enteric bacterial such as Salmonella to present with empyema, and should prompt a search for intra-abdominal infection. Pleural decortication and splenectomy can be performed during the same surgical sitting and can lead to good surgical outcomes."

We report the case of a 33-year-old otherwise healthy, not overtly immunosuppressed, man who was transferred to our facility with the chief complaint of respiratory failure and septic shock. Computed tomography of the chest revealed multifocal pneumonia in both lungs. A bronchial alveolar lavage was performed in the right middle lobe and cultures predominantly grew Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The patient received a prolonged course of antimicrobials, ultimately changing to oral levofloxacin. The etiology of the salmonella infection likely occurred through an aspiration event. Salmonella species are not a typical respiratory pathogen in immunocompetent hosts; however, clinicians should be aware of the possibility that salmonella species may be a pathogenic source of infection in the lungs; a prolonged course of antimicrobials may be warranted."

These infections can result in uncomplicated diarrhea in most cases, but can lead to invasive disease requiring antimicrobial therapy and can be life-threatening in elderly or immunocomprimised patients. Broad-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are crucial options in the treatment of the invasive infections. Ciprofloxacin resistance is rarely seen in non-typhoid Salmonella enterica isolates, and only in S. Typhimurium, S. Choleraesuis and S. Schwarzengrund. In this report, we aimed to discuss a patient infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella Kentucky under the light of data from our country and the world. A 52-year-old male patient wih acute myocardial infarction was hospitalized in intensive care unit of cardiovasculer surgery for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation for the treatment of left ventricular disfunction. On the seventh day of LVAD and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the patient presented high fever and productive cough. His physical examination revealed hyperemia around the insertion point of right jugular central venous catheter (CVC) and a serous discharge from the insertion point of LVAD located just below the inferior edge of sternum. Empiric IV cefoperazone/sulbactam (SCF) therapy was started with the prediagnosis of pneumonia and bloodstream infection. The blood samples taken from peripheral veins and CVC, and swabs taken from LVAD insertion point for culture when the patient was febrile, revealed the growth of bacteria with S type and lactose-negative colonies on EMB and SS media. Biochemical characteristics of the isolate were as follows: lactose fermentation negative, H2S positive, IMVIC (-,+,-,+), urease negative, lysine/ornithine decarboxylase positive and motile. The bacteria was then identified as Salmonella enterica serotype Kentucky (8,20;i;z6) by agglutination tests. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were conducted according to CLSI guidelines and it was found as ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant. Ciprofloxacin resistance of the isolate was confirmed with E-test. Stool culture was performed to investigate the source of infection, and S. Kentucky was isolated. On the 15th day of SCF treatment, LVAD was taken out, and tissue cultures taken from the fibrillar tissues between pericardial layers during surgery, also yielded S. Kentucky growth. On the second day of SCF therapy the patient's fever returned normal and on the seventh day, CBC and CRP values were normalized. Nevertheless, the clinical situation of the patient worsened gradually and on the 40th day he was intubated due to low oxygen saturation and pleural effusion. His antibiotherapy was stopped on 42nd day as the blood cultures were negative and his clinical situation was attributed to cardiac failure. The patient died four days after the antibiotherapy has stopped due to cardiac reasons. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella Kentucky in our country."

PmTAN59 was isolated from a sputum swab from a pneumonia patient in Tanta University Teaching Hospital. PmKAF126 was isolated from a patient with a diabetic foot infection in a hospital in the city of Kafr El-Sheikh. The two isolates were identified with bacterial small ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplification and sequencing and tested for antimicrobial sensitivity with a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay. The two strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulante, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprime, and tetracycline, but sensitive to aztreonam, imipenem, and meropenem. Molecular characterization was used to map the entire backbone, including the multiple antibiotic resistance (MDR) region, of Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1). Both isolates carried a structure similar to SGI1, with two different MDR regions corresponding to SGI1-PmABB in PmTAN59 and SGI1-W in PmKAF126. SGI1-PmABB carried an integron of ~1.5kb with a two-gene cassette, aacCA5-aadA7, which confers resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and spectinomycin, whereas SGI1-W carried an integron of ~1.9kb containing aadA2-lnuF, which confers resistance to spectinomycin, streptomycin, and lincosamides. PmKAF126 carried the entire SGI1 sequence, however PmTAN59 carried a SGI1 structure with a deletion in the region from ORF S005 to ORF S009 and accompanied by insertion of IS1359 (1258bp). Furthermore, PmTAN59 carried class 2 integron of ~2.2kb containing dfrA1-sat2-aadA1. An ERIC-PCR analysis detected no clonal relationship between the two strains. Molecular screening for other antimicrobial resistance genes and a plasmid analysis indicated that PmTAN59 carried an IncFIB plasmid type. This strain also carried blaTEM-1 and the plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance gene qnrA1. However, PmKAF126 carried no plasmids and no resistance gene other than that contained in the MDR region of SGI1 and floR gene conferring resistance to florfenicol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an SGI1-positive P. mirabilis strain in Egypt or on the entire African continent."

AIM: To describe clinical and microbiological aspects of infections by Salmonella spp. in children in a pediatric referral hospital: Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell, in Montevideo, Uruguay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive and retrospective study of 46 patients, from which Salmonella spp was isolated between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010. RESULTS: Salmonella spp was isolated in 46 children younger than 15 years old. 18 were below 2 years old and 5 children below three months. 24% of the children had risk factors, such as HIV infection, oncological diseases and malnutrition; low birth weight and pneumonia were associated conditions. No deaths were reported. The serotypes more frequently found were: Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Most of the strains were susceptible to ampicillin and third generation of cephalosporins. DISCUSSION: Diarrhea with blood was the predominant clinical presentation, and there were no outbreaks. Typhimurium and Enteritidis were the most common serotypes. Based on the profiles of susceptibility antimicrobial, we could maintain the same recommendations until the moment suggested. CONCLUSIONS: we must consider the Salmonella infection in febrile children under risk of an invasive bacterial disease, with or without focal infection."

However, data on the clinical and microbiological profile as well as factors associated with complications of typhoid in Bangladesh are scarce. We intended to characterise the clinical and microbiological profile of culture-proven typhoid fever and to identify factors associated with complications. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective analysis of clinical data from 431 patients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever admitted to Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, between January 2010 and December 2014. Clinical and microbiological profiles of the patients including age, sex, and duration of illness prior to hospital admission, haematological parameters and the antimicrobial resistance profile of the infecting isolate, duration of hospital stay and defervescence time were examined by logistic regression to identify the factors associated with complications. RESULT: About one of three patients were children under 5 years, and 21.5% of them were severely malnourished. During hospitalisation, 17.4% patients developed complications; mainly encephalopathy (6.7%), ileus (6.5%) and pneumonia (3.5%). Among culture-positive cases, 28.3% isolates showed multidrug resistant (MDR) and more than 90% of isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and had intermediate sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. Five isolates were resistant to azithromycin; all isolates were sensitive to cefixime and ceftriaxone. Complication was independently associated with duration of fever before admission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.074-0.97; P &lt; 0.05), thrombocytopenia on admission (AOR: 2.84; 95% CI: 01.06-7.57; P &lt; 0.05), duration of hospital stay (AOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.15-1.57; P &lt; 0.01) and defervescence time (AOR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.99; P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of typhoid fever among under-five children and complications among hospitalised patients are matters of concern. Sensitivity of Salmonella Typhi to ceftriaxone and cefixime was better than to other conventional antibiotics. Shorter duration of fever and thrombocytopenia on admission can be considered as early signs of complications."

In Asia, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are reported to be the major invasive Salmonella infections, while invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are believed to be uncommon. Data from Sarawak, in Malaysian Borneo, are limited. METHODS: A retrospective study identifying all children aged &lt; 15 years with invasive Salmonella infections from 2011 to 2016 was conducted in Bintulu Hospital in Sarawak. Population incidences, clinical and bacterial characteristics were examined. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were identified during the 6-year study period: 43 had iNTS infection and 1 had typhoid fever. The average annual iNTS incidence was 32.4 per 100,000 children aged &lt; 5 years. None of the children had malaria or HIV infection, and only 7% were severely malnourished. Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Java were the commonest NTS serovars identified. Pneumonia was the most common manifestation of iNTS disease, present in 20 (47%) children. Other manifestations included gastroenteritis, fever without a source, septic arthritis and meningitis. Salmonella Enteritidis was identified in 76% of those with pneumonia, significantly more frequently than in children with other manifestations. Over 25% of children with iNTS developed severe disease and nearly 10% suffered long term morbidity or mortality. While 78% of Salmonella Java isolates were multi-drug resistant, nearly all other isolates were susceptible to most antimicrobials, including ampicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Bintulu Division in Sarawak observed a very high incidence of childhood iNTS infections. Enteric fever was uncommon. The epidemiology of invasive Salmonella infections in Malaysian Borneo differs considerably from that of neighbouring countries in Asia."

This relation has been published for patients who suffer from AIDS, and so Salmonella bacteremia could even begin the clinical disease. But even though the relation between the infection by Salmonella and AIDS is well known, and the pulmonary involvement in them has been told, this etiology as a producing agent of lung cavitation has not much documentation. METHODS: We examined three patients (two women and one man) suffering from fever of one week of duration, cough, expectoration and thoracic pain in two of them. The third patient had fever and cachexia without clinical symptoms. The man and the two women had a blood count with neutrophilia and leucocytosis in two cases and leucopenia in the other one. All of them suffered a very important depression of cell immunity (CD4 of 140, 70 and 4, respectively) and positive blood cultures for Salmonella typhimurium. RESULTS: Chest X-Ray showed, in all the cases, pulmonary cavities.

DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: We studied the records of all HIV-infected patients with Salmonella bacteremia diagnosed at a university tertiary hospital from January 1987 to December 1995. RESULTS: Lung involvement was found in 18 (35.3%) of 51 HIV-infected individuals with Salmonella bacteremia. Six of 18 (33.3%) were diagnosed as having definite Salmonella pulmonary infection by isolation of Salmonella from respiratory specimens, while probable Salmonella lung disease was considered in two patients who developed lung abscesses without the identification of any pathogen. Predisposing factors for focal disease, such as prior lung disease or Salmonella serotype, were equally prevalent regardless of the presence of Salmonella pulmonary involvement. Cavitary infiltrates or abscess formation were seen in five of the eight patients. With the exception of one patient coinfected with Nocardia asteroides who died 1 month later, all patients were cured with antibiotic treatment. Superinfection with other pulmonary pathogens (10 cases, 56%) was more frequent than Salmonella pneumonia; the most frequent alternative diagnosis was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (5 cases, 28%), pyogenic bacterial infection (17%), and tuberculosis (11%). CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected patients with Salmonella bacteremia, lung involvement is frequent, although there were no significant factors to explain this association. Cavitary disease was the most common radiologic pattern, and focal lung disease due to Salmonella does not seem to be associated with a worse prognosis. Coinfection and superinfection with other respiratory pathogens are more common than isolated Salmonella lung disease, and therefore, additional diagnostic procedures must be considered in the evaluation of these patients."

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (&gt; or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p &lt;.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity."

We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PEGE) typing to analyse an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We included samples from nine patients, three handwashes and ten environmental isolates from an outbreak (February to August 1999) in addition to four patient isolates from different wards of our hospital during the same time period. The clinical presentations of the outbreak included bacteraemia (four cases), pneumonia (three cases), umbilical wound infection (one case) and conjunctivitis (one case). Nine outbreak isolates exhibited an identical PFGE fingerprint, while the epidemiologically unrelated strains demonstrated distinct patterns. Epidemiological investigation failed to reveal a common source of the outbreak, although the epidemic S. marcescens strain was isolated from hand-washes and doors of incubators. We concluded that cross-transmission via transient contamination of hands was the major route for this outbreak. Strict handwashing practices, the cohorting and isolation of colonized and infected patients, and the regular dis-infection of incubators are crucial steps for preventing the transmission of S. marcescens in an NICU. This PFGE method is highly discriminatory for the thorough epidemiological investigation of an outbreak of S. marcescens."

The cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the CAP-cefepime group, the HAP-cefepime group, and the HAP-ceftazidime group, respectively. The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing CAP and HAP indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents."

In particular, the division succeeded in increasing the frequency of general round table discussions for patients with infections. We strongly recommend to frequently gargle with Isodine at operations. Recently, we have followed up patients with infections caused by MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia or carriers of these bacteria, and determined the drug sensitivities of clinical isolates. In addition, because of the current highly aged society, a high percentage of inpatients has various underlying diseases. In particular, there are quite a few cases in which pneumonia occurs as an opportunistic infection. From studies in these patients and patients of the dental department, it has been shown that oral microorganisms clearly decrease in count by careful tooth brushing and gargling with Isodine, with prevention of pneumonitis caused by oral microorganisms. As we consider that antisepsis with povidone-iodine is useful for the prevention of nosocomial and opportunistic infections, we would like to report the findings of our study currently under way."

We conducted an investigation of P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens isolates related to bronchoscopy at a community hospital. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all bronchoscopic procedures at the community hospital from July to October 2001. Environmental samples were obtained. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on isolates of P. aeruginosa. RESULTS: From July 1 to October 31, 2001, 66 bronchoscopic procedures were performed in 60 patients, and 43 specimens were obtained for bacterial culture; 20 of the specimens (47 percent) were positive for P. aeruginosa. Six (30 percent) of the specimens that were positive for P. aeruginosa also yielded S. marcescens. All 20 P. aeruginosa isolates were associated with procedures performed with three of four new bronchoscopes from the same manufacturer. Contrary to manufacturing specifications, the biopsy-port caps on all four bronchoscopes were easily removable, and P. aeruginosa was cultured from the biopsy ports of the three implicated bronchoscopes. The PFGE patterns of P. aeruginosa isolates from the bronchoscopes, patients, and two environmental samples were indistinguishable. One patient was hospitalized with P. aeruginosa pneumonia 11 days after bronchoscopy. The manufacturer reported a design change instituted in 1997, and production problems may have resulted in the distribution of bronchoscopes that did not meet specifications. CONCLUSIONS: We documented contamination of bronchoscopes with P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens and possible infection of patients at a community hospital as a result of the inadequate disinfection of bronchoscopes because of a manufacturing defect."

This report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) in the TSAR II collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (TSAR I) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. Resistance of the 5 Enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed ""first-line"" antimicrobials in Taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in E. coli, 68% in P. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in K. pneumonia to 66% in S. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in K. pneumoniae to 70% in P. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. Resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in Taiwan than most Western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant A. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli (12%). Differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in TSAR II; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout Taiwan."

The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia."

Over a 16-month period, a total of 27 infants were either colonized (N=14) or infected (N=13). There were 15 cases of S. marcescens and 11 cases of K. pneumoniae. Both micro-organisms were involved in one fatal case. Seven preterm babies developed septicaemia, two had bacteraemia, three had respiratory infections and one had purulent conjunctivitis. The S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae isolates were investigated by three molecular methods: enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arbitrary primed PCR with M13 primer, and random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Different patterns were found in the 16 S. marcescens epidemic isolates from 16 newborn infants. The major epidemic-involved genotype was linked to the first nine cases and this was subsequently replaced by different patterns. Eight different typing profiles were also determined for the 13 K. pneumoniae isolates from 12 newborn infants. Four K. pneumoniae bacteraemic strains proved to be identical. In conclusion, the typing results revealed that two different micro-organisms (S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae) were simultaneously involved in invasive nosocomial infections in preterm newborns. Two simultaneous clusters of cases were documented. Heterogeneous genotypes among both species were also demonstrated to be present in the NICU at the same time. A focal source for both micro-organisms was not identified but cross-transmission through handling was probably an important route in this outbreak. Strict adherence to handwashing policies, cohorting, isolation of colonized and infected patients, and rigorous environmental hygiene were crucial measures in the containment of the epidemic."

An expanded effort to detect ESBL among 123 nonrepetitive isolates of S. marcescens was made and 15 (12%) ESBL-producers were identified, all revealing CTX-M-3. Without routinely detecting the ESBL for S. marcescens in clinical laboratories, 80% of the ESBL-producers were reported to be susceptible to cefepime. The clinical spectrum of ESBL-producing S. marcescens-related infections included febrile urinary tract infection (n = 3); afebrile pyuria (n = 2); pneumonia (n = 3); spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (n = 3); secondary bacteremia (n = 2) and one each with primary bacteremia and colonization of the central catheter tip. Overall, the 30-day mortality rate was 33.3% (5/15) and the outcome depended on the severity of the underlying disorder and infection per se. In conclusion, although our case numbers were limited, due to the substantial incidence and associated mortality of ESBL-producing S. marcescens and its potential treatment failure by an apparently susceptible cephalosporin, we recommend that the detection and report of ESBL production for S. marcescens in clinical laboratories be made mandatory."

The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy."

Thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. The mean age of those treated was 56.2 years; 73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. There were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and Staphylococcus aureus (10). Clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). After 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, Streptococcus salivarius was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, Klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of Serratia marcescens. We included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to Mycoplasma pneumonia and one to Legionella pneumophila. Ofloxacin was well tolerated. Our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections."

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients admitted to the ICU of a 677-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital in Belgium during 1997-2002. METHODS: ICU-acquired pneumonia was defined as a case of pneumonia that occurred 2 days or more after admission to the ICU in combination with a positive results of radiologic analysis, clinical signs and symptoms, and a positive culture result. All cases of pneumonia were categorized as either early onset (within 7 days after admission) and late onset (7 days or more after admission), with or without previous antibiotic treatment, and the corresponding pathogens were analyzed. Risk factors for the isolation of pathogens potentially resistant to multiple drugs (ie, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter species, Acinetobacter species, Burkholderia species, extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producing pathogens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 4,200 patients stayed at the ICU for 2 or more days, 298 of whom developed ICU-acquired pneumonia, for an overall incidence of 13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 11-14 cases) per 1,000 ICU-days. Pathogens potentially resistant to multiple drugs were isolated from 52% of patients with early-onset pneumonia. Risk factors for the isolation of these pathogens were greater age and previous receipt of antibiotic prophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.6 [95% CI, 1.6-13.0]) or antibiotic therapy (aOR, 8.2 [95% CI, 2.8-23.8]). The length of ICU admission and hospital stay were weaker risk factors for the isolation of these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens potentially resistant to multiple drugs were isolated in 52% of cases of early-onset ICU-acquired pneumonia. Previous antibiotic use (both prophylactic and therapeutic) is the main risk factor for the isolation of these pathogens."

METHODS: A review is made of the clinical records of 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with CGD between 1980 and 2005. RESULTS: All patients were males. The mean age at diagnosis was 36 months. The clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis comprised the following: Abscesses or abscessified adenopathies 4/13 (Staphylococcus aureus (2), Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens and Klebsiella sp.), pneumonia 3/13 (Rhodococcus equi, Salmonella typhimurium plus Pneumocystis jiroveci), osteomyelitis 1/13 (Aspergillus sp.), sepsis 1/13 (S. aureus), urinary infection 1/13 (Klebsiella sp.), severe gastroenteritis 1/13, oral aphthae 1/13 and Crohn-like inflammatory bowel disease 1/13. The diagnosis was initially established by the nitroblue tetrazolium test, and confirmed by flow cytometry 10/13 and genetic techniques (gp91) 9/13. In the course of these disease processes there were 88 infections: abscesses (n = 26), lymphadenitis (n = 12), pneumoniae (n = 10), gastroenteritis (n = 7), sepsis (n = 6), osteomyelitis (n = 3) and others (n = 24). As to the germs isolated, the frequency distribution was as follows (n = 49): Aspergillus sp. (n = 10), Staphylococcus sp. (n = 7), Salmonella sp. (n = 6), Serratia sp. (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Klebsiella sp. (n = 4), Proteus sp. (n = 3), Leishmania sp. (n = 2) and others (n = 8). IFN-gamma was administered in 7/13 cases, and itraconazole in 9/13; all received cotrimoxazole. There were four deaths, with one case each of sepsis due to gramnegative bacterial infection; disseminated aspergillosis; visceral leishmaniasis and hemophagocytosis; and post-kidney transplant complications. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical suspicion and flow cytometry are the keys for diagnosis of CGD and detection of carrier relatives. Specific prophylactic measures and medical controls are required to prevent serious infections. IFN-gamma has been used intermittently, though its effectiveness is controversial."

We performed a prospective observational study of 912 cases of adult CAP in Asian countries from January 2002 to December 2004. Systemic laboratory evaluation for determining the etiology and clinical evaluation were performed. Of 912 cases with CAP, 93 (10.1%) cases were caused by GNB: 59 with K. pneumoniae, 25 P. aeruginosa, 7 Enterobacter species, 1 Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 Serratia marcescens. CAP caused by GNB was more frequently associated with septic shock, malignancy, cardiovascular diseases, smoking, hyponatremia, and dyspnea, according to multivariate analysis (P &lt; 0.05). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 7.3% (65/885). Mortality was significantly higher in the GNB group than in the non-GNB group [18.3% (17/93) vs. 6.1% (48/792); P &lt; 0.001]. GNB as a causative microorganism was found to be one of the independent risk factors for mortality (adjusted OR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.02-6.78, P = 0.046) with nursing home residence, mechanical ventilation, cardiovascular disease, respiratory rate &gt; 30/min, and hyponatremia (all P &lt; 0.05). GNB was not only a frequent etiology of severe CAP but also an independent risk factor for mortality. Data suggest that an initial empirical antimicrobial coverage of GNB including P. aeruginosa should be seriously considered in cases of severe pneumonia, especially in patients with underlying malignancy, underlying cardiovascular diseases, smoking, septic shock, and hyponatremia."

The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from &lt; or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time."

However, it has not been known to form granulomas. A 72-year-old man with a history of tricuspidal insufficiency, mitral insufficiency and ureterolithiasis presented with lumbago on the left side. He was admitted to our hospital, where abscess formation in the subcapsular space and perirenal fat space of the left kidney, and left renal calculi were identified by computed tomography of the abdomen. As infection and/or a tumor were suspected, nephrectomy was performed. The histopathological findings in the resected kidney indicated severe infiltration by inflammatory cells with lymphoid follicles in the interstitium, and the proliferation of mesangial cells and matrix in glomerulus. Furthermore, giant cell granulomas were observed in the soft tissue around the kidney. As an aerobic culture of the abscess from the granulomas only produced Serratia marcescens, these granulomas were diagnosed as Serratia marcescens granulomas. In addition, expressions of PTHrP and PTH/PTHrP-receptor were observed in the giant cells in Serratia granuloma, which suggested that PTHrP might be involved in giant cell formation in Serratia granuloma by autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient P., 23 years of age, diagnosis: right-sided distal pneumonia, severe course; parapneumonic empyema of pleura. Bacteria isolation, cultural and biochemical tests differentiating S. algae and Shewanella putrefaciens were performed according to Holt H.M. et al., 2005. Identification of bacteria, tests of sensitivity to antibiotics were carried out by automatic system Vitek 2 (bioMerieux) and additionally by disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: S. algae in association with Serratia marcescens were isolated from pleural exudate of the patient with pneumonia. S. algae bacteria had typical taxonomical features and pathogenicity factors (lipase, gelatinase, beta-hemolysin); were resistant to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, cefazolin and sensitive to other beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracycline. CONCLUSION: S. algae bacteria isolated from pleural exudate of the patient with pneumonia are etiologically significant in parapneumonic empyema of pleura."

The literature associates several bacteria with this type of infection; most common in intensive care units are Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and some of the Enterobacteriaceae family. OBJECTIVES: To identify the causal agents of nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care units of Havana's Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical-Surgical Teaching Hospital in 2011, and to characterize their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using hospital administrative data of quantitative cultures from positive tracheal aspirates for January through December, 2011. Records were analyzed from 77 intensive care unit patients who developed nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. Variables examined were age and sex, and pathogens identified from culture of tracheal aspirate and related antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS Species most frequently isolated were: Acinetobacter baumannii in 53 patients (68.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 34 patients (44.2%), other species of Pseudomonas in 15 patients (19.5%), and Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in 12 patients each (15.6%). Some patients presented more than one pathogen in concurrent or successive infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing found high percentages of resistance to antibiotics in all these pathogens. Least resistance was found to colistin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia is of concern. Colistin is the drug of choice among the antibiotics reviewed, but sensitivity to other antibiotics should be assessed to search for more appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. Our results also suggest the need to strengthen infection control efforts, particularly in intensive care units, and to reassess compliance with quality control procedures. Multidisciplinary research involving microbiologists, epidemiologists, internists and intensivists is needed to fully understand the etiological and resistance patterns observed."

Here we summarize data from the HIGM syndrome Registry of the Latin American Society for Immunodeficiencies (LASID). Of the 58 patients from 51 families reported to the registry with the clinical phenotype of HIGM syndrome, molecular defects were identified in 37 patients thus far. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, immunological and molecular data from these 37 patients. CD40 ligand (CD40L) deficiency was found in 35 patients from 25 families and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency in 2 unrelated patients. Five previously unreported mutations were identified in the CD40L gene (CD40LG). Respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia, were the most frequent clinical manifestation. Previously undescribed fungal and opportunistic infections were observed in CD40L-deficient patients but not in the two patients with AID deficiency. These include the first cases of pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens or Aspergillus sp. and diarrhea caused by Microsporidium sp. or Isospora belli. Except for four CD40L-deficient patients who died from complications of presumptive central nervous system infections or sepsis, all patients reported in this study are alive. Four CD40L-deficient patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation. This report characterizes the clinical and genetic spectrum of HIGM syndrome in Latin America and expands the understanding of the genotype and phenotype of this syndrome in tropical areas. "

A 57-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for four weeks with community acquired pneumonia. A chest x-ray, six weeks after discharge, demonstrated multiple, bilateral 'cannon ball'-like opacities and mediastinal lymphadenopathy which were highly suspicious of disseminated malignancy or tuberculosis. The only symptom that this patient had was a productive cough. She had multiple commodities, but no specific immunodeficiency disorder. Interestingly, her sputum and bronchial washing samples grew S. marcescens. The computed tomography-guided lung biopsy demonstrated necrotic granulomatous changes. There was no pathological evidence of tuberculosis or fungal infection, malignancy or vasculitis. There are only a handful of reported cases of Serratia granulomas. Thus, we are reporting a rare instance of pulmonary Serratia marcescens granuloma radiologically mimicking metastatic malignancy and tuberculosis infection. "

METHODS: Descriptive study of children admitted to the Unit with S. marcescens infection from November 2012 to March 2013. Conventional microbiological methods for clinical and environmental samples were used. The clonal relationship between all available isolates was established by molecular methods. A multidisciplinary team was formed, and preventive measures were taken. RESULTS: S. marcescens was isolated from 18 children. The overall attack rate was 12%, and the case fatality rate in the Intensive Care Unit was 23.5%. The most prevalent types of infections were pneumonia (6), conjunctivitis (6), and bloodstream infection (5). Clinical isolates and environmental isolates obtained from an incubator belonged to a unique clone. The clonal relationship between all S. marcescens strains helped us to identify the possible source of the outbreak. CONCLUSION: Isolation of S. marcescens from stored water in a container, and from the surface of an incubator after cleaning, suggests a possible environmental source as the outbreak origin, which has been perpetuated due to a failure of cleaning methods in the Unit. The strict hygiene and cleaning measures were the main factors that contributed to the end of the outbreak."

These pathogens constitute a further threat because they are also resistant to numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, as well as other antibiotic groups. This study retrospectively investigates antimicrobial resistance in hospitalized patients suffering from pneumonia triggered by Gram-negative Serratia marcescens or Proteus mirabilis. METHODS: The demographic and clinical data analyzed in this study were obtained from the clinical databank of the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, for inpatients presenting with pneumonia triggered by S. marcescens or P. mirabilis from 2004 to 2014. An antibiogram was conducted for the antibiotics utilized as part of the management of patients with pneumonia triggered by these two pathogens. RESULTS: Pneumonia was caused by Gram-negative bacteria in 115 patients during the study period from January 1, 2004, to August 12, 2014. Of these, 43 (37.4 %) hospitalized patients [26 males (60.5 %, 95 % CI 45.9 %-75.1 %) and 17 females (39.5 %, 95 % CI 24.9 %-54.1 %)] with mean age of 66.2 +- 13.4 years had pneumonia triggered by S. marcescens, while 20 (17.4 %) patients [14 males (70 %, 95 % CI 49.9 %-90.1 %) and 6 females (30 %, 95 % CI 9.9 %-50.1 %)] with a mean age of 64.6 +- 12.8 years had pneumonia caused by P. mirabilis. S. marcescens showed an increased antibiotic resistance to ampicillin (100 %), ampicillin-sulbactam (100 %), and cefuroxime (100 %). P. mirabilis had a high resistance to tetracycline (100 %) and ampicillin (55 %). S. marcescens (P &lt; 0.0001) and P. mirabilis (P = 0.0003) demonstrated no resistance to cefepime in these patients with pneumonia.

Of 8796 biological samples, consisting mainly of bronchial aspirate (97.9 %), 2056 bacterial strains were isolated and subjected to identification. VITEK 2 was used to determine drug susceptibility (classified according to the EUCAST criteria). ESBL, MBL and KPC-producing strains were identified by means of phenotypic methods using appropriate discs. The findings were that the predominant bacteria responsible for infections consisted of Enterobacteriaceae (42.0 %), Acinetobacter baumannii (37.2 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.1 %), and Stenotrophomonas maltophila (4.7 %). We observed a rise in the number of bacteria causing pneumonia throughout the study period, especially in S. maltophila and Enterobacteriaceae ESBL (+). Gram-negative bacilli were 100 % susceptible to colistin, apart from naturally resistant strains such as Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, whereas Enterobacteriaceae ESBL (+) were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. Acinetobacter baumannii strains exhibited the lowest drug susceptibility. In conclusion, we report an increase in the prevalence of pneumonia associated with Gram-negative bacteria in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients. Colistin remains the most effective drug against the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. Therapeutic problems are common in the course of treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infections."

The aim is to identify those microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive and prospective study was conducted, including patients over 14 years with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia during a 383 consecutive day period. A record was made of sociodemographic variables, personal history, prognostic severity scales, progress, and pathogenic agents. The aetiological diagnosis was made using blood cultures, detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila urinary antigens, sputum culture, influenza virus and Streptococcus pyogenes detection. Categorical variables are presented as absolute values and percentages, and continuous variables as their means and standard deviations. RESULTS: Of the 287 patients included in the study (42% women, mean age 66+-22 years), 10.45% died and 70% required hospital admission. An aetiological diagnosis was achieved in 43 patients (14.98%), with 16 microorganisms found in 59 positive samples. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Streptococcus pneumonia (24/59, 41%), followed by gram-negative enteric bacilli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae isolated in 20% of the samples (12/59), influenza virus (5/59, 9%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3/59, 5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/59, 3%), Moraxella catarrhalis (2/59, 3%), Legionella pneumophila (2/59, 3%), and Haemophilus influenza (2/59, 3%).

About 50% of colonization occurred before cefazolin prophylaxis and was present on admission to the intensive care unit. Typing of strains showed that horizontal transmission accounted for at most 14% of carriage. Cefazolin prophylaxis (and high gastric pH) were associated with increased levels of postoperative colonization, most notably for enterobacter. About 25% of colonization with enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia was followed by clinical infection. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common pathogen and pneumonia the most common infection. Infections contributed to eight of 11 deaths; four of the eight involved enterobacter.

Nineteen patients with pyogenic ventriculitis were reviewed for their treatment. The bacterial testing results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the clinical intervention, and the patients' prognosis were evaluated. The bacterial smears of ventricular drainage from all the cases were G- bacteria. Head CT and MRI scans confirmed that they were intraventricular empyema. Eighteen cases of CSF bacterial test were positive, including 12 cases of Acinetobacter baumannii positive, 2 of Klebsiella pneumonia positive, 2 of Serratia marcescens positive, 1 of Pseudomonas maltophila positive, and 1 case of Escherichia coli positive. One case of the bacterial culture was negative. All patients were treated by using intraventricular lavage in combination with intravenous and intraventricular antibiotics in accordance with the clinical conditions. After treatment for 2 to 8 weeks, 14 patients were cured (74%) and 5 were died (26%). Eight patients who were cured had received ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus at 2 to 6 weeks after infection controlled, and none of them had any reinfection. Twelve of the 14 cured cases came to consciousness, but 2 were persistent in vegetative state starting before the infection; they did not show any improving consciousness after infection had been cured. Suppurative ventriculitis in severe neurosurgical patients is mainly infected by G- with a higher mortality. Early diagnosis, especially in identifying pathogen types, timely ventricular irrigation, and ventricular drainage together with intravenous and intraventricular antibiotic treatment, should improve prognosis."

Methods: A retrospective study of a total of 106 microbiologically febrile episodes in hospitalized adult neutropenic cancer patients, who were admitted from May 2009 to May 2013, at King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Results: Among 106 microbiologically documented febrile neutropenic episodes, the majority of malignancies were solid tumors accounting for 53.8% (57/106) and hematological malignancies accounted for 46.23% (49/106). The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 19.81% (21/106) followed by acute myeloid leukemia 15.09% (16/106), then colorectal cancer 13.21% (14/106), pancreatic cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 5.66% (6/106) each, multiple myeloma 4.72% (5/106), gall bladder cancer 3.77% (4/106), and lung cancer 2.83% (3/106). A total of 138 bacterial isolates were identified. The overall prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was 65.94% (91/138) and for gram-positive bacteria was 34.06% (47/138). The most common bacterial isolation sites were blood 33.32% (46 isolates), urine 29.71% (41 isolates), wound 19.55% (27 isolates), body fluids 9.41% (13 isolates) and sputum 7.96% (11 isolates).

Aeromonas hydrophylia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Stenotropomonas multipholia contributed to 0.72% with one isolate each. For gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers (ESBLs) rates were 38% and 22.22% respectively. For Pseudomonas aerugenosa imipenem-cilastatin resistance rate was 18.84%. For gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was 28.62%. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) rate was 1.18%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent as a cause of infection in adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia at our institution, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia with high ESBLs rates being the most common pathogens. Blood stream infections followed by urinary tract infections were the most common sites of infection.

The aim of this study was to describe a case series of patients treated with fosfomycin who had severe infections caused by pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Methods: We describe a prospective series of cases of hospitalized patients with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria resistant to beta-lactams and colistin, treated with 16 g of fosfomycin daily for 10-14 days. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and synergism of fosfomycin with meropenem. We tested for resistance genes and performed typing using PCR and WGS. Results: Thirteen patients received fosfomycin (seven immunosuppressed); they had bloodstream infections (n = 11; 85%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (n = 1; 8%) and surgical site infection (n = 1; 8%), caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 9), Serratia marcescens (n = 3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). Overall, eight (62%) patients were cured. Using time-kill assays, synergism between fosfomycin and meropenem occurred in 9 (82%) of 11 isolates.

While the more severe forms, such as pseudomembranous and ulcerative ATB, occur almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, the milder obstructive form may occur in patients without immune deficiency. CASE REPORT: The case of a 32 year-old man with no previous history of illness, who was evaluated for recurrent right lower lobe pneumonia, is presented. Microbiological sputum studies revealed growth of Serratia marcescens, and a limited growth of Aspergillus fumigatus, the latter interpreted as a contaminant in the specimen. Bronchoscopy revealed a dense mucous plug at level B10 of the right lower lobe, which could not be removed; no other macroscopic findings of interest were observed. During his hospital admission, the patient expectorated the mucous plug and had a significant subsequent bronchorrhoea. A substantial number of colonies of A. fumigatus grown in the sputum cultures. The patient was given voriconazole, leading to a clinical resolution, with no recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive ATB is characterised by the excessive production of thick, hyphae-laden mucus, which can obstruct the airway lumen and generate relapsing post-obstructive pneumonias. It is important to consider this diagnosis in immunocompetent patients with recurrent respiratory infections and who show repeated isolation of Aspergillus colonies in the sputum, even in small quantities."

We studied 51 intubated, intensive care unit patients prospectively by serial examinations of tracheal aspirates for elastin fibers, graded Gram's stains, and quantitative bacterial cultures in conjunction with clinical and radiologic observations in an attempt to develop criteria for the early detection of pulmonary infection. Patients with infection had new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates plus 1 of the following: positive blood culture results, radiographic evidence of cavitation, or histologic evidence of pneumonia, or 2 or more of the following: new fever, new leukocytosis, or grossly purulent tracheal aspirates. Twenty-one patients developed infection, 22 remained colonized, and 8 had an uncertain status. Infiltrates developed in 34 patients (21 infected, 8 colonized, 5 uncertain status). Gram-negative bacilli were most commonly isolated and were more frequent in infected patients (81 versus 47%, p less than 0.05); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were most often associated with infection. No differences were observed between infected and colonized patients in demographic features, smoking history, underlying disease, previous antibiotic therapy, days in hospital before intubation, preexisting pneumonia upon intubation, or highest temperature or leukocyte count during course.

Data were collected from patient interview and medical charts with a standardized questionnaire. A tracheal aspiration was performed for each patient. Humidifiers were analysed for bacteriological contamination. Overall 77 tracheal aspirates (TA) were obtained from patients included. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 90% of cases (69/77) with a majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32/77, 41%), Staphylococcus aureus (34/77, 44%) and Serratia marcesens. (22/79, 38%) Amoxicillin + Clavulanic-acid and Cefotaxime were adapted for respectively in only 28% and 35% of the subjects due to the natural resistance of organisms. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from humidifier samples. Risk factors significantly associated with P. aeruginosa colonization were residence in a medical-care home (p = 0.01, OR = 3.8 [1.1; 15.1]) and the presence of a cuff (p = 0.003, OR = 4.4 [1.1; 20.6]).

A total of 30 of 38 patients were evaluable, 16 in the ceftriaxone group (average age 66.3 years) and 14 in the cefamandole group (average age 69.4 years). All but one had underlying diseases. Patients usually received 1 g of ceftriaxone intravenously every 12 h (mean duration 8.7 days) or 1.5 g of cefamandole intravenously every 6 h (mean duration 8.2 days). Adverse experiences attributable to the drugs were confined to one episode of discomfort at the infusion site in each group. Bacteriological results with ceftriaxone were 83% cured, 11% superinfected after eradication of pretherapy isolate, and 6% failed. Bacteriological results with cefamandole were 76% cured, 24% failed. Clinical results with ceftriaxone were 38% cured, 56% improved, 6% failed. Clinical results with cefamandole were 57% cured, 21% improved, 21% failed. Emergence of a resistant Serratia marcescens was seen in a ceftriaxone-treated patient. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing identified six of the seven pretherapy nonfastidious Gram-negative isolates as susceptible; however, two of the six could not be eradicated with the assigned drug and another two were eradicated with ensuing super-infection with susceptible isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The clinical features, etiologic agents, population at risk, treatment, and outcome in patients with well-documented gram-negative pneumonia were compared in two groups of patients: those with bacteremic pneumonia and those with nonbacteremic pneumonia documented by transtracheal aspiration. Clinical features were frequently subtle in both groups. A wide range of gram-negative bacilli were implicated as pathogens and pneumonias documented by transtracheal aspiration were frequently mixed infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were the most common pathogens causing bacteremic pneumonias, whereas Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were more common in the nonbacteremic group.

Overall, the success rate was 83% and drug-related adverse effects were minimal. The drug was less efficacious in infections caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens than it was in those caused by gram-negative pathogens. The following gram-positive organisms were associated with special problems during moxalactam therapy: Streptococcus pneumoniae (development of meningitis and a relapse of pneumonia with a more resistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (in vivo emergence of moxalactam resistance, and the enterococci (failure of therapy and a fatal superinfection. Moxalactam performed well in infections caused by most gram-negative organisms, including aminoglycoside-resistant strains, but the previously reported emergence of gram-negative bacillary resistance to moxalactam during therapy was reconfirmed in our series with Serratia marcescens. The use of moxalactam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis was further supported by a patient with meningitis-ventriculitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis who was cured with moxalactam after failure on chloramphenicol."

Knowledge of the incidence of pneumonia due to different pathogens that are brought into an institution from the community may play a role in determining the patterns of infecting organisms responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia. For 1 year, we prospectively reviewed the records of patients admitted to our 1000-bed community hospital with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Patients had clinical signs and symptoms, positive radiologic findings, and pure cultures of potential pathogens from sputum, blood, pleural fluid, lung aspirate, lung biopsy, or transtracheal aspirate. Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila was diagnosed by serum indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titer greater than or equal to 1:256 and clinical signs and symptoms along with response to erythromycin. Of 204 patients with bacterial pneumonia, the following pathogens were implicated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus species, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, oral anaerobic bacteria, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and others. Most patients were more than 50 years of age and many had evidence of underlying pulmonary disease. The etiology of CABP may not be as predictable as in the past. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for CABP should include agents with activity against the pathogens prevalent in the community."

As patients live longer with more underlying disease and more iatrogenic disease, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia will probably rise. Adequate sterilization of inhalation therapy equipment can reduce the risk of gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia. Methods to prevent colonization and microaspiration need to be investigated. The development of a gram-negative vaccine using Salmonella RE or E. coli J5 mutant would augur well for the future. Most important, the elderly patient with pneumonia should be managed promptly and aggressively in an attempt to determine the specific etiology of the pneumonia. The practice of antibiotic ""shotgunning"" of the elderly patient is to be avoided. Transtracheal aspiration or sheathed bronchoscopy can be performed if the patient is not able to produce sputum, or Gram stain is difficult to interpret. Morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early appropriate antibiotic therapy directed by Gram stain."

An antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. Cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. Organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae in 6, E. coli in 3, Proteus mirabilis in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. The Serratia were resistant (MIC greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other MIC's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. Satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. Two patients died from their underlying disease. Adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included SGOT rises in 3 and rash in one. Serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to 12.5 microgram/ml (trough). Sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml.

In 16, S. marcescens was the only organism cultured from the lungs during life or at autopsy. This report describes primarily these pure infections. Two histopathologic reactions were seen.

In seven, distinctive vasculitis was apparent in vessels larger than 75 microns in diameter; intramural gram-negative rods were identified in two. Seven immunosuppressed patients had diffuse neutropenic pneumonitis resembling diffuse alveolar damage, with extensive intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates and pulmonary hemorrhage. In two patients, bacteria without cellular reaction were present. In patients with prolonged infections, focal areas of intra-alveolar organization and bronchiolitis obliterans accompanied both patterns. Since the incidence of nosocomial S. marcescens infection is increasing and since pneumonia caused by this organism is recognizable histologically, autopsy cultures positive for S. marcescens should not be disregarded."

Pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common cause of pneumonia (33 patients). The other causes were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Cytomegalovirus (4), Haemophilus influentiae (4), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), E. coli (2), Serratia marcescens (1). No etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. We stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Pneumocystis carinii, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influentiae (1). Since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in HIV+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. Moreover, Pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and PCP has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (CD3+CD4 &lt; 200/mcl; LDH &gt; 600 UI/dl; PO2 &lt; 70 mmHg) patterns, always related to the discovery of Pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. Thus, we decided to treat 15 patients with specific therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery.

SUMMARY: A 39-year-old man with severe head trauma was found face down and unresponsive in a river after a watercraft accident. After being resuscitated and transferred to the intensive care unit, the patient received treatment for a subarachnoid hemorrhage and spinal injuries. The patient was also found to have decreased breath sounds bilaterally. On hospital day 7, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed due to acute febrile illness and thick pulmonary secretions. The patient was treated empirically with i.v. vancomycin and cefepime. The culture results suggested pneumonia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The vancomycin and cefepime were replaced with nafcillin, after which the pneumonia resolved. The patient continued to be febrile, with leukocytosis on hospital day 14. A subsequent bronchoalveolar lavage culture performed that day revealed the presence of S. putrefaciens. According to the culture and susceptibility results, S. putrefaciens was resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam and exhibited sensitivity to cefepime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and meropenem. The patient received a 14-day course of cefepime, eliminating any further sign of the pathogen. Over the next two months, the patient's condition continued to improve, and he was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSION: A 39-year-old man developed ventilator-associated pneumonia evidently caused by S. putrefaciens. The pneumonia resolved after treatment with cefepime."

It is found widely in the nature especially in marine environments. Although it is accepted as saprophytic, different clinical syndromes, most commonly skin or soft tissue infections, have been associated with S.putrefaciens, mainly in immunocompromised cases and patients with underlying diseases. However, pneumonia cases due to S.putrefaciens are quite limited in the literature. In this report, a case of pneumonia caused by S.putrefaciens was presented. A 43-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of fever, cough, sputum and weakness. The patient has had brochiectasis since childhood and has used periodical antibiotic therapies due to pneumoniae episodes. She was diagnosed to have pneumonia based on the clinical, radiological and laboratory findings, and empirical antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime combination was initiated. Gram-stained smear of sputum yielded abundant leucocytes and gram-negative bacteria, and the isolate grown in the sputum culture was identified as S.putrefaciens by conventional methods and API 20 NE (BioMerieux, France) system. The isolate was found susceptible to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cephoperazon-sulbactam, imipenem, amikacin, gentamicin and trimethoprime-sulphametoxazole; whereas resistant to ampicillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefazolin and cefuroxime, by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. According to the antibiogram results, the therapy was changed to ceftriaxone (1 x 2 g, intravenous). The patient was discharged with complete cure after 14 days of therapy. In conclusion, S.putrefaciens should be considered in patients with predisposing factors as an unusual cause of pneumonia and the characteristics such as H2S production and sensitivity to third generation cephalosporins and penicillins should be used to differentiate it from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and prevent the unnecessary use of antipseudomonal antibiotics."

CASE PRESENTATION: Two male patients with a history of gastrointestinal cancer presented to hospital with pulmonary and bloodstream infections, respectively. The infective pathogens of both cases were primarily isolated and identified as Shewanella algae (case I) and Shewanella putrefaciens (case II) by phenotypic features and VITEK 2 system, but they were further confirmed as Shewanella haliotis and Shewanella upenei by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The major bacterial composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage in case I was also identified as Shewanella by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the two strains had broad susceptibility, but S. haliotis in the case I was resistant to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and S. upenei in the case II was intermediate to imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cases of the pulmonary and bloodstream infections caused by Shewanella spp. from clinical patients in mainland China. Shewanella as a potential pathogen in China should not be ignored."

On presentation, the patient was tachycardic, borderline hypotensive, and febrile. Physical examination was significant for diffuse petechiae and ecchymoses over the extremities, torso, and the face, especially confluent over her thighs and lower abdomen. She was admitted to the ICU, and initial investigations revealed a normal leukocyte count and hemoglobin but severe thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bilirubin, transaminases, and an elevated INR. She also had a high anion gap metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate. Chest and abdomen CT findings were nonspecific, demonstrating fluid surrounding both kidneys, a moderate amount of fluid in the pelvis, and alveolar opacities at the bases of both lungs. Initial working diagnoses were a septic shock, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and vasculitis. She was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and doxycycline pending culture reports. After a few hours, she became progressively hypothermic, developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemodynamic instability, and was intubated due to acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. She progressively worsened hemodynamically with multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately was pronounced dead roughly 18 hours after initial presentation. Blood cultures grew a Gram-negative organism, initially reported as Shewanella putrefaciens, but subsequently confirmed as Capnocytophaga canimorsus."

In this retrospective study we describe 28 cases of S. putrefaciens bacteremia: 16 in premature and 1-day-old neonates, 9 in adults, and 3 in children younger than 1 year of age. All the babies presented with respiratory distress and/or pneumonia. Six of the adults had associated traumatic lesions of the lower extremity, and of the eight patients who died of sepsis, six were neutropenic. Polymicrobial bacteremia was seen in 18 cases. Three syndromes of bacteremic infection with S. putrefaciens appear to exist: the first is associated with prematurity and congenital pneumonia; the second with ulceration of the lower extremities; and the third (which is more fulminant), with an underlying debility. The findings in these 28 cases confirm the fact that S. putrefaciens can invade the bloodstream; however, the presence of concurrent bacteremia makes it difficult to determine the pathogenic role of this organism in septicemia."

These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections."

CASE REPORT: We describe a case of pneumonia in an immunocompetent, previously healthy middle-aged man from Switzerland without relevant travel history which was presumably caused by Shigella sonnei. He was originally admitted for suspected lung cancer. The clinical picture was remarkable as the patient presented with cough and purulent sputum production, but otherwise no classical signs of pneumonia. Furthermore, there was no diarrhoeal episode in the recent history. It is an uncommon presentation of shigellosis in an immunocompetent person without underlying severe predisposing conditions. CONCLUSION: We report an unusual identification of S. sonnei as the only identified pathogen from respiratory specimens, which we therefore consider the most likely etiology of this subacute atypical pneumonia. This case illustrates the importance of a complete work-up in a patient whose suspected malignancy could not be proven."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed in the CCU of a single tertiary medical center. Patients who were admitted to the CCU between March 23, 2002, and May 25, 2003, and who required invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours were included. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients who met the study criteria, 17 (18.5%; 95% confidence interval, 11.9%-27.6%) developed VAP. The incidence of VAP was 36.3 (95% confidence interval, 21.1-58.1) per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation. There were no statistically significant differences in demographics, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or use of continuous intravenous sedatives or neuromuscular blockers between patients with and without VAP. The most commonly isolated organisms were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The median length of stay in the CCU for patients with VAP was 10 days compared to 6 days for patients without VAP (P &lt; .01). Eight (47%) of the 17 patients with VAP died compared to 29 (39%) of 75 patients without VAP (P = .52). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VAP in the CCU is similar to or higher than that reported in other intensive care units. The development of VAP in CCU patients is associated with a prolonged CCU stay but not with an increased hospital mortality."

The aim of this study is to investigate the microbiological and clinical features of S paucimobilis infection in southern Taiwan. METHODS: S paucimobilis isolates from the microbiology laboratory of Chi-Mei Medical Center and their relevant clinical data from October 2005 to October 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients with documented S paucimobilis infections were identified. Among them, 29 (52.7%) have community-acquired infections and 13 of them presented with primary bacteremia (44.8%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that community-acquired infection [adjusted odds ratio 13.473, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79-101.41, p = 0.01], diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio 7.03, 95% CI 1.16-42.66, p = 0.03), and alcoholism (adjusted OR 10.87, 95% CI 1.00-117.69, p = 0.05) were significant risk factors for S paucimobilis primary bacteremia. Most of those who have health care-associated S paucimobilis infections presented with pneumonia (10 of 26, 38.5%) and only 7.7% presented with catheter-related infection. The overall mortality rate was 5.5%. CONCLUSION: Community-acquired S paucimobilis infections were not uncommon, mainly presenting with primary bacteremia. Multivariate analysis showed that community-acquired infection, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholism were significant risk factors for primary bacteremia."

S. paucimobilis which is widely found in nature and hospital environments rarely cause serious or life threatening infections. In this report, a case of hospital acquired bloodstream infection due to S. paucimobilis in a patient with Down syndrome who was on treatment for presumed pneumonia is presented. A one year-old child patient who was a known case of Down syndrome and had previously experienced cardiac surgery was hospitalized and treated for pneumonia. On the 12th day of hospitalization, blood cultures were taken because of a high body temperature. One of the blood cultures was positive for gram-negative rods. After 48 hour of incubation, the sub-cultures on blood agar medium yielded pure growth of a yellow, non-fermentative, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium. The microorganism was positive for oxidase, and esculin hydrolysis, while negative for urea and nitrate reduction, citrate utilisation and motility. The isolate had been identified as S. paucimobilis by using Vitek 2 system. The antibiotic susceptibility test was also performed with the same system and the strain was found to be susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and other antibiotics. Treatment with intravenous piperacilin-tazobactam (150 mg/kg/day) was initiated. He responded well to the treatment and was discharged after 10 days. This case is reported to emphasize that S. paucimobilis should be kept in mind as a nosocomial infectious agent in patients with Down syndrome and immunosuppressive patients and the infections should be treated according to the sensitivity test results."

Methods: A retrospective study of a total of 106 microbiologically febrile episodes in hospitalized adult neutropenic cancer patients, who were admitted from May 2009 to May 2013, at King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Results: Among 106 microbiologically documented febrile neutropenic episodes, the majority of malignancies were solid tumors accounting for 53.8% (57/106) and hematological malignancies accounted for 46.23% (49/106). The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 19.81% (21/106) followed by acute myeloid leukemia 15.09% (16/106), then colorectal cancer 13.21% (14/106), pancreatic cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 5.66% (6/106) each, multiple myeloma 4.72% (5/106), gall bladder cancer 3.77% (4/106), and lung cancer 2.83% (3/106). A total of 138 bacterial isolates were identified. The overall prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was 65.94% (91/138) and for gram-positive bacteria was 34.06% (47/138). The most common bacterial isolation sites were blood 33.32% (46 isolates), urine 29.71% (41 isolates), wound 19.55% (27 isolates), body fluids 9.41% (13 isolates) and sputum 7.96% (11 isolates). The most predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli 30.43 (42/138), Klebsiella pneumonia 14.49% (20/138), Staphylococcus aureus 13.04% (18/138), Sptreptococcus spp. 7.25% (10/138), Pseudomonas spp. 7.25% (10/138), Enterococcus spp. 5.80% (8/138), Staphylococcus spp. 4.35% (6/138), Corynebacterium spp. 3.62% (5/138), Enterobacter spp. 3.62% (5/138), Acinobacter spp. 2.90% (4/138), Serratia marcescens 2.17% (3/138), Proteus mirabilis 1.45% (2). Aeromonas hydrophylia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Stenotropomonas multipholia contributed to 0.72% with one isolate each. For gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers (ESBLs) rates were 38% and 22.22% respectively. For Pseudomonas aerugenosa imipenem-cilastatin resistance rate was 18.84%. For gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was 28.62%. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) rate was 1.18%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent as a cause of infection in adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia at our institution, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia with high ESBLs rates being the most common pathogens. Blood stream infections followed by urinary tract infections were the most common sites of infection. The use of initial antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic episodes should be based on local bacterial spectrum and susceptibility/sensitivity patterns to prevent treatment failure with increased morbidity and mortality."

None of the neonates developed pneumonia or sepsis. After each increase in the fluctuating number of S. paucimobilis isolates, extra attention was paid to hand hygiene and to the maintenance of the ventilation equipment. This resulted in a reduction of the frequency of isolation each time. Cultures of all liquids in use and of the ventilation equipment were negative on several occasions. Fifteen months after the start of the outbreak, the NICU was moved to another building, and some older ventilation equipment was abandoned. After a period of six weeks without problems, S. paucimobilis was isolated in association with at least four ventilators. A new investigation showed that the ventilator temperature probes were the source of contamination. Once effective sterilization procedures for the temperature probes were introduced no new cases appeared, until a spare ventilator with an unautoclaved temperature probe was accidentally used and this caused contamination of one child. After correction, no further cases have occurred to date. The clonal relatedness of the outbreak isolates from patients and from ventilator temperature probes was documented by fingerprinting with the arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction."

A 49% increase in all types of nosocomial infections and an 85% increase in nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by S. maltophilia were noted over the 5-year period. Trends of resistance to 7 antimicrobial agents against S. maltophilia remained stable. Seventeen patients had positive cultures of XDRSM in the year 2004, including 6 with pneumonia and 1 with biliary tract infection, and the other 10 patients had XDRSM colonization. Twelve patients (70.6%) had positive cultures of non-XDRSM prior to the acquisition of XDRSM. The mortality rate of patients with XDRSM infection was higher than those with colonization (85.7% versus 10%, P = 0.004). XDRSM infection, presence of shock, and the number of dysfunctional organ systems at the time of XDRSM isolation were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (P &lt; 0.05). Genotyping of the 17 XDRSM isolates revealed 16 different clones. All the isolates tested possessed class 1 integron and formed biofilms and melanin. The high genotypic heterogeneity among XDRSM isolates was indicative of the polyclonal nature of emergence of these resistant bacteria. Majority of patients had positive cultures of non-XDRSM prior to the acquisition of XDRSM, indicating that the use of antibiotics might have resulted in selection of XDRSM."

Multivariate analysis was performed to access factors associated with 14-day mortality. A total of 60 infections were identified. Among these, eight (13%) were pneumonias and 52 were BSIs; 33.3% were primary, 13% were central venous catheter (CVC)-related and 40% were secondary BSIs. Fifty-seven (85%) patients had received previous antimicrobial therapy; 88% had CVC, 57% mechanical ventilation and 75% were in the intensive care unit at the onset of infection. Malignancy (45%) was the most frequent underlying disease. The mean of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores was 17 and for the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, it was 7 points. The overall and 14-day mortality were, respectively, 75% and 48%. Forty-seven (78%) patients were treated and, of these, 74% received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Independent risk factors associated with mortality were SOFA index &gt;6 points (0.005) and septic shock (0.03).

In HAP the virulence of bacterial species is known to be different. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of high-risk bacteria like S. aureus and pseudomonas species on pulmonary MMP concentration in human pneumonia. METHODS: In 37 patients with HAP and 16 controls, MMP-8, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) were analysed by ELISA and MMP-9 activity using zymography in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). RESULTS: MMP-9 activity in mini-BAL was increased in HAP patients versus controls (149 +/- 41 vs. 34 +/- 11, p &lt; 0.0001). In subgroup analysis, the highest MMP concentrations and activity were seen in patients with high-risk bacteria: patients with high-risk bacteria MMP-9 1168 +/- 266 vs. patients with low-risk bacteria 224 +/- 119 ng/ml p &lt; 0.0001, MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity 325 +/- 106 vs. 67 +/- 14, p &lt; 0.0002.

From 2000 to 2004, common pathogens were Acinetobacter baumanii (n = 40, 34.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 32, 27.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 24, 20.5%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 8, 6.8%). There were 2 cases (2/64, 3.1%) caused by Staphylococcus aureus from 1995 to 1999, and both were caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); there were 24 cases caused by Staphylococcus aureus from 2000 to 2004, and 21 cases (21/117, 17.9%) were caused by MRSA.There were 11 (11/47, 23.4%) and 45 (45/90, 50.0%) cases with central intravenous catheters in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, respectively. In the period of 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, durations of aerosolized therapy were (46 +/- 55) and (28 +/- 30) days. There were 12 patients (12/47, 25.5%) using second-generation cephalosporin before VAP occurred in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 7 patients (7/90, 7.8%) in the period of 2000 to 2004. There were 13 patients (13/47, 27.7%) using penicillin before VAP in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 10 patients (10/90, 11.1%) in the period of 2000 to 2004. There were 10 patients (10/47, 21.3%) using quinolones before VAP in the period of 1995 to 1999 and 46 patients (46/90, 51.1%)in the period of 2000 to 2004. The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be related to the cross-infection between inpatients (Wald = 16.690, P &lt; 0.01, OR = 9.212). VAP caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was positively related to duration of aerosolized therapy (Wald = 7.852, P &lt; 0.01, OR = 1.021). VAP caused by Acinetobacter baumanii was positively related to third-generation cephalosporin usage (Wald = 5.553, P &lt; 0.05, OR = 3.461). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VAP was not increased in the recent 10 years in our RICU, but the incidence of VAP caused by Acinetobacter baumanii. Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA increased significantly, may be related to the decrease of duration of aerosolized therapy, the usage of different kinds of antibiotics and cross-infection between inpatients."

METHODS: antibiotic sensitivity test was done. A comparison was made between patients with nosocomial pneumonia reported by infection surveillance team against those reported by the attending physician with the infectious disease consultant. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the bacteria most frequently reported with 134 isolates (26 %), 71 were multiple-drug-resistant; followed by Staphylococcus with 122 isolates (24 %), of which 88 were S. aureus with 62 of them (70 %) methicillin-resistant. Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, as well as Acinetobacter sp. and S. maltophilia were occasionally isolated. Candida represented 17 % of the isolates. Three peaks of isolates of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were identified during the two years of surveillance. There were differences in cases of ventilator associated pneumonia reported by the hospital based epidemiology team and the attending clinicians in collaboration with an Infectious disease consultant. CONCLUSIONS: prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53 %) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus (70 %) isolated from the airway is high in our Intensive Care Unit.

Cumulative incidence of early bacterial infection at day 100 post-UCBT was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-13%) for children and 21% (CI, 19%-24%) for adults (P &lt; .0001). Early bacterial infection in adults had a significant impact on mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1, CI, 1.7-2.6; P &lt; .0001), although no significant risk factors were identified. Multivariate analysis identified older age group (6-10, and 11-15 years versus 0-5 years of age) at transplant (HR = 2.0 and 2.7, CI, 1.1-3.5 and 1.4-4.9; P = .020 and .002, respectively) as an independent risk factor of early bacterial infection for children. Early bacterial infection in children did not have a significant impact on mortality when adjusted. Of 315 bacteremia, 74% were caused by Gram-positive microorganisms. Pneumonia occurred in 39 patients including 13 cases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia. Early bacterial infection had a negative effect on survival for adults and the median day of development was 10 days after transplant, suggesting that the prevention of bacterial infection in the very early post-UCBT phase is important."

Nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. Data from 308 ICUs from the German National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. Each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the ICU. The frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. A total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the CDC criteria had been modified. From 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (2,718 cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), Escherichia coli (1,137 cases), Enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), Acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). The order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: S. aureus was first, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. This classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups."

We investigated the fundamental information on the characteristics of hemodialysis inpatients and nosocomial pneumonia. We surveyed 1803 hemodialysis patients admitted to our university hospital between 2001 and 2007. The mean patient age was 64.8 years and the average period of hospitalization was 28.1 days, which was considerably longer than the average stay in our hospital (14.2 days). Patients were admitted to many different departments and for various reasons. We isolated 391 microorganisms from the sputum of 120 pneumonia patients undergoing hemodialysis, including Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which were the leading three isolates. From these 120 patients, a total of 199 pathogens were identified as being responsible for the pneumonia. Multi-drug resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was found to be susceptible to a new fluoroquinolone, but is resistant to older generation quinolones. Out of the 120 patients with pneumonia, 12 out of 18 patients infected with S. maltophilia died, indicating the highest fatality rate for this pathogen. In this survey, we found that hemodialysis patients were hospitalized for long periods, and for various reasons in many departments. They suffered from nosocomial pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens, including S. maltophilia. For pneumonia due to S. maltophilia, new generation fluoroquinolones can be the treatment of choice, although S. maltophilia-related pneumonia should be treated very carefully because of its high fatality rate."

We hypothesised that sputum microbiology may have changed as a result of this. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of sputum microbiology from adult CF patients (1985 to 2005) using the Royal Brompton Hospital CF database. RESULTS: Colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus between 1985 and 2005 remained stable (77 to 82%, p=0.159; 54 to 47%, p=0.108; respectively).

DESIGN: A retrospective, single-center, observational study. SETTING: A 2400-bed tertiary teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated patients (age, at least 18 years) with nosocomial pneumonia (S. maltophilia isolated from respiratory culture) who were seen at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a 3-year period. A total of 406 patients (64% male, mean age +/- standard deviation, 69.6 +/- 14.93 years; mean duration of hospital +/- standard deviation, 57.5 +/- 39.47 days) were included. RESULTS: Most index isolates (53.9%) were from the first sample cultured. Polymicrobial isolates were cultured from samples from 177 (43.6%) of the 406 study patients. The most common copathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53.11% of isolates). The all-cause hospital mortality rate was 42.6% (173 deaths among 406 patients). Survivors had a shorter time from admission to a positive index culture result than did nonsurvivors (26.1 vs 31.7 days; P = .04). Mortality was significantly higher among patients with malignancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-4.07; P &lt; .001), renal disease (AOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.51-4.47; P = .001), intensive care unit stay (AOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7; P = .018), and inadequate initial empirical antibiotic therapy (AOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.4-3.38; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia pneumonia is associated with a high mortality rate and is commonly associated with concomitant polymicrobial colonization or infection.

We review the medical and microbiology literature and the results of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2008) to establish the pathogens most likely to cause HABP or VABP. In all studies, a consistent 6 organisms (Staphylococcus aureus [28.0%], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [21.8%], Klebsiella species [9.8%], Escherichia coli [6.9%], Acinetobacter species [6.8%], and Enterobacter species [6.3%]) caused approximately 80% of episodes, with lower prevalences of Serratia species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and community-acquired pathogens, such as pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae. Slight changes in the pathogen order were noted among geographic regions; Latin America had an increased incidence of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. In addition, VABP isolates of the same species had a mean of 5%-10% less susceptibility to frequently used extended-spectrum antimicrobials, and the rate of drug resistance among HABP and VABP pathogens has been increasing by 1% per year (2004-2008). In conclusion, the empirical treatment of HABP and VABP due to prevailing bacterial causes and emerging drug resistance has become more challenging and requires use of multidrug empirical treatment regimens for routine clinical practice. These facts have profound impact on the choices of comparison therapies to be applied in contemporary new drug clinical trials for pneumonia."

Antibacterial therapies to treat pulmonary exacerbations are instituted empirically and are individualized based on both patient factors (severity of exacerbation, frequency of exacerbation, recent courses of anti-infectives) and pathogen factors (previously isolated pathogens and in vitro predicted susceptibilities). However, the epidemiology of pathogens infecting CF airways is changing, with increased incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative non-fermenters such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Accordingly, a great need for new and novel agents for the management of acute exacerbations in CF exists. While several antibiotics have recently been approved or are close to approval for clinical use, frequently their emphasis has been for Gram-positive, and specifically MRSA-related, disease. Despite this, these agents may have a role in CF-related exacerbations. This article reviews the spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics and clinical and theoretical evidence for the use of newer agents including tigecycline, doripenem and ceftobiprole in the management of CF pulmonary exacerbations. Appropriate use of these agents in CF will require detailed CF-specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data."

CASE SUMMARY: A 28-year-old male was admitted with a severe head injury and required mechanical ventilation. The patient developed S. maltophilia VAP on hospital day 17, which was cured after 7 days of treatment with high-dose intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). However, on day 34, the patient developed recurrent S. maltophilia VAP that did not respond clinically or demonstrate eradication on follow-up culture after 10 days of TMP/SMX. At that time, TMP/SMX was discontinued and treatment was initiated with intravenous doxycycline and aerosolized colistin. The VAP episode was cured after 14 days of treatment with doxycycline/aerosolized colistin. DISCUSSION: S. maltophilia is an emerging cause of VAP in some centers. This organism is associated with high mortality rates and has few treatment options because it is intrinsically resistant to most drug classes. Recent data suggest that doxycycline and aerosolized colistin each are effective in treatment of other multidrug-resistant organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, this is the first report describing the use of this antibiotic regimen for S. maltophilia. High-dose TMP/SMX is considered to be the drug of choice primarily based on excellent in vitro activity. Few data exist on how to treat patients who fail therapy with TMP/SMX or cannot receive that drug because of resistance, allergy, or adverse events. Thus, it is important to report alternative methods for treating this infection. CONCLUSIONS: The positive clinical response to doxycycline and aerosolized colistin seen in the patient described here suggests that this combination may be an alternative treatment in patients who fail initial treatment or cannot receive standard therapies."

RESULT: Six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as HAP. The incidence of HAP was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset HAP and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset HAP. The HAP patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). The proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. Main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. There was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in ICU, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. Two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. One hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. There were 30 (13.0%) Gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%) fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. The predominant bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations cephalosporins. The main pathogens of early-onset HAP were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset HAP were ESBLs-positive Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: HAP in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. The main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. RSV was an important pathogen of HAP. The pathogens of early-onset HAP are different from those of late-onset HAP. These results may be of some help in prevention and control of HAP in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice."

DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review. SETTING: Level I trauma intensive care unit of a large academic medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 101 patients who developed S. maltophilia VAP between January 1997 and December 2007. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients' baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as characteristics of their VAP, were documented. The primary study outcome was the rate of clinical success in patients with S. maltophilia VAP; a secondary outcome was microbiologic plus clinical success rate in these patients. Standard definitions were employed to determine these outcomes related to VAP treatment. The study population had higher injury severity scores and a higher rate of traumatic brain injury than is typically observed in the study's intensive care unit. The median time to diagnosis of S. maltophilia VAP was 15 days (interquartile range 11-24 days). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the sole organism isolated in 34% of patients; the other patients had polymicrobial VAP. Despite inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy being administered to 97% of the patients, the overall clinical success rate was 87%. The microbiologic plus clinical success rate was 82%. The most common treatments for S. maltophilia VAP were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (77 patients received monotherapy, 9 received combination therapy) and ciprofloxacin (6 patients received monotherapy, 8 received combination therapy); all-cause and VAP-related mortality rates were 13% and 7%, respectively.

However, using an arbitrary day cutoff or clinical signs can be suboptimal for some, especially multiply injured patients, resulting in relapse and/or antibiotic resistance. Previously, we showed that repeat bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) could guide antimicrobial duration for community-acquired VAP in trauma patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP in trauma patients secondary to hospital-acquired pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with VAP secondary to MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM), or Enterobacteriaceae (ENB) during 6 years were evaluated. All received empiric antimicrobial therapy based on duration of ICU stay. Therapy was tailored based on culture data. Repeat BAL was performed on day 4 of appropriate therapy. Microbiological resolution was defined as &lt;=10(3) colony-forming units/mL. Recurrence was defined as &gt;=10(5) colony-forming units/mL on subsequent BAL performed within 2 weeks after completion of appropriate therapy. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty-nine patients were identified. Seventy-seven percent of patients underwent repeat BAL: 96 with MRSA, 100 with AB, 139 with PA, 50 with SM, and 120 with ENB. The majority of patients with MRSA or PA achieved microbiological resolution after 14 days. Nearly 60% of patients with AB, SM, or ENB achieved microbiological resolution after 10 days. Overall recurrence was 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat BAL provides objective evidence for VAP resolution in the face of potentially confounding clinical factors. Hospital-acquired VAP can be managed effectively by a defined course of therapy with a low recurrence. Duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP in trauma patients should be dictated by the causative pathogen."

We report on a 57-year-old woman treated with intensive chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed severe neutropenia, hemorrhagic pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure, which led to her death within 36 h of onset of pneumonia. Postmortem examination revealed bilateral extensive intraalveolar hemorrhage associated with severe infection by the gram-negative bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In vitro susceptibility testing showed resistance to carbapenem, cephalosporines and aminoglycosides, but sensitivity to minocycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole). Early diagnosis and adequate antibiotic treatment were difficult, as the clinical course was rapid and fulminant, and this bacterium is resistant to multiple antibiotics. To improve prognosis in such cases, it will be necessary to develop an effective prophylactic strategy for high-risk patients."

","SPECIES:Stenotrophomonas maltophiliaID:21729271TITLE:Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis: genome diversity, biofilm formation, and virulence.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is emerging as one of the most frequently found bacteria in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In the present study, phenotypic and genotypic traits of a set of 98 isolates of S. maltophilia obtained from clinical (CF and non-CF patients) and environmental sources were comparatively evaluated. RESULTS: S. maltophilia exhibited a high level of genomic diversity in both CF and non-CF group, thus possibly allowing this bacterium to expand its pathogenic potentials. Strains sharing the same pulsotype infected different patients, thus likely indicating the occurrence of clonal spread or acquisition by a common source. CF isolates differed greatly in some phenotypic traits among each other and also when compared with non-CF isolates, demonstrating increased mean generation time and susceptibility to oxidative stress, but reduced ability in forming biofilm. Furthermore, in CF isolates flagella- and type IV pili-based motilities were critical for biofilm development, although not required for its initiation. Sequential isogenic strains isolated from the same CF patient displayed heterogeneity in biofilm and other phenotypic traits during the course of chronic infection. CF and non-CF isolates showed comparable virulence in a mouse model of lung infection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the phenotypic differences observed between CF and non-CF isolates may imply different selective conditions and persistence (adaptation) mechanisms in a hostile and heterogeneous environment such as CF lung. Molecular elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential to better understand the selective adaptation in CF airways in order to design improved strategies useful to counteract and eradicate S. maltophilia infection."

We performed a study to determine whether empiric HCAP antibiotic regimens targeting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with greater appropriate therapy. A retrospective cohort study of culture-positive HCAP over 6 years (January 2003-December 2008) was performed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1200-bed urban teaching hospital. We identified 757 consecutive patients with HCAP. IIAT was administered to 213 (28%) patients. The pathogens most frequently associated with IIAT included P. aeruginosa (n=60, 28%), MRSA (n=58, 27%), and Acinetobacter species (n=32, 15%).Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that empiric anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-2.29; p=0.036), empiric anti-MRSA antibiotics (AOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.36-2.14; p=0.018), infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (AOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.03-3.91; p=0.002), absence of Acinetobacter species infection (AOR, 10.57; 95% CI, 7.29-15.33; p&lt;0.001), absence of P. aeruginosa infection (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.36-2.05; p=0.014), and absence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection (AOR, 20.43; 95% CI, 9.35-44.66; p&lt;0.001) are independent predictors of appropriate therapy for HCAP. Our study suggests that initial therapy for HCAP should include antibiotics targeting MRSA and P. aeruginosa in order to provide appropriate initial therapy. However, the selection of individual antibiotic agents should be based on local patterns of infection and adjusted when microbiology results become available."

This was a retrospective analysis of 64 medical ICU patients with S. maltophilia in the respiratory tract. Thirty-six patients fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of pneumonia. A significantly higher lung injury score (LIS) was observed in patients with pneumonia compared to patients with colonization (p=0.010). Independent risk factors for S. maltophilia-pneumonia were higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (p=0.009) and immunosuppression (p=0.014). Patients with S. maltophilia-pneumonia had higher ICU mortality within a 28-day follow-up (p=0.040) and higher hospital mortality (p=0.018) than patients with colonization. The highest antibiotic susceptibility rates were observed to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, and moxifloxacin. Higher SOFA score when S. maltophilia was isolated (p=0.001) and development of renal failure (p=0.021) were independent risk factors for ICU mortality. Higher SOFA score and immunosuppression are independent risk factors for S. maltophilia-pneumonia.

However, its clinical course remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia in Toranomon Hospital (890 beds, Tokyo, Japan) were reviewed retrospectively between April 2006 and March 2010. RESULTS: During the study period, 10 cases of S. maltophilia pneumonia were identified. Seven patients had acute myeloid leukemia, 2 had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 had malignant lymphoma. All patients developed symptoms after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Five patients received first cord blood transplantation (CBT), 4 patients received second CBT, and 1 patient received first peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The overall incidence of S. maltophilia pneumonia among 508 patients who received HSCT during the period was 2.0%. The incidence was 0% (0/95) in patients after bone marrow transplantation, 0.8% (1/133) after PBSCT, and 3.2% (9/279) after CBT. Pneumonia developed a median of 13.5 days (range, 6-40) after transplantation. At onset, the median white blood cell count was 10/muL (range, 10-1900), and the median neutrophil count was 0/muL (range, 0-1720). In all patients, S. maltophilia bacteremia developed with bloody sputum or hemoptysis. The 28-day mortality rate was 100%; the median survival after onset of pneumonia was 2 days (range, 1-10). CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic S. maltophilia pneumonia rapidly progresses and is fatal in patients with hematologic malignancy. Attention should be particularly paid to the neutropenic phase early after HSCT or prolonged neutropenia due to engraftment failure. A prompt trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-based multidrug combination regimen should be considered to rescue suspected cases of S. maltophilia pneumonia in these severely immunosuppressed patients."

We report 2 cases of nosocomial S.M. infection in 2 hospitalized newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. CASE 1: A 3-day-old newborn presented with infection beginning in the respiratory system, treated with ciprofloxacin, and complicated by septicemia, resulting in death. CASE 2: An 11-day-old newborn presented with brain S.M. suppuration: empyema and multiple abscesses were treated successfully with the combination of amikacin and chloramphenicol with good progression in the short and medium terms. DISCUSSION: Some epidemiological studies report that S.M. is the second Gram-negative bacillus responsible for nosocomial infection after Klebsiella pneumoniae. While the respiratory location of the bacterium is typical, cerebral parenchyma damage is rare in the newborn. The treatment remains very delicate and difficult because of this bacterium's drug multiresistance. CONCLUSION: These 2 cases of infection caused by S.M. including respiratory tract infection with bacteremia and cerebral suppuration in newborns have broadened the spectrum of diseases caused by this organism and are a reminder of the emergence of this organism and its natural resistance to several antibiotics."

We compared these recipients with 30 non-HCT patients with S. maltophilia infection. The mortality rate in HCT recipients was significantly higher than that in non-HCT patients (relative risk 5.7, P=0.04), and we identified seven patients with pulmonary hemorrhage due to S. maltophilia, exclusively in the HCT cohort. Six of these latter seven patients died within 1 day from the onset of hemorrhage and the isolate was identified after death in most cases; one patient, who received empiric therapy for S. maltophilia and granulocyte transfusion, survived for more than 2 weeks. The patients with pulmonary hemorrhage had a more severe and longer duration of neutropenia, persistent fever despite of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, complication by pneumonia and higher C-reactive protein levels than those without pulmonary hemorrhage. In conclusion, S. maltophilia was associated with fulminant and fatal pulmonary hemorrhage in HCT recipients. Empiric therapy with antibiotics before the onset of pulmonary hemorrhage may be effective in HCT recipients who carry the conditions identified."

We performed a retrospective analysis of 346 LDLT recipients. Fifty patients (14.5%) experienced bacterial pneumonia after LDLT, and they had a higher short-term mortality rate (42.0%) than patients with other types of bacterial infections after LDLT. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 84.0% of the causative pathogens. A multivariate analysis showed that preoperative diabetes (P &lt; 0.01), United Network for Organ Sharing status 1 or 2A (P &lt; 0.01), and an operative blood loss &gt; 10 L (P = 0.03) were significant risk factors for bacterial pneumonia after LDLT. Post-LDLT pneumonia was associated with the following post-LDLT events: the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation (&gt;=3 days), a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (&gt;=7 days), the creation of a tracheostomy, primary graft dysfunction, the use of mycophenolate mofetil, and the need for renal replacement therapy. Among patients with bacterial pneumonia, the mortality rate was higher for patients with delayed-onset pneumonia, which occurred at least 10 days after transplantation (n = 15), and it was significantly associated with graft dysfunction. A combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aminoglycosides provided cover for most gram-negative bacteria except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which was associated with a longer period of mechanical ventilation and was resistant to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics. Delayed-onset bacterial pneumonia is a serious type of bacterial infection after LDLT and is frequently associated with graft dysfunction. The multidrug resistance of S. maltophilia is an issue that needs to be addressed."

To our knowledge, nine cases of fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia have been reported in the literature. All the patients had hematological neoplasms and were severely neutropenic after one or two intensive chemotherapy regimens. They died shortly (within 3 days) after the onset of the hemorrhagic pneumonia. Management of the infection caused by S. maltophilia is hampered by high-level intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics and the increasing occurrence of acquired resistance to co-trimoxazole and fluoroquinolones. It would be important to keep in mind that hemorrhagic respiratory infection caused by S. maltophilia may lead to a fulminant and lethal course in severely neutropenic patients with hematological neoplasms and to recognize which antibiotic agents are more sensitive to S. maltophilia in each institution."

PAP is usually an auto-immune disease though, less commonly, may be congenital or secondary to another underlying disorder, such as infection, an immunodeficiency or a haematological disease. A positive diagnosis can be made with the appearance of ""crazy-paving"" on a computed tomography scan, with a milky fluid bronchial aspiration. A cytological examination will also show eosinophilic material and pink stained periodic acid-Schiff-positive material. A whole lung lavage is the most widely accepted therapy for hypoxemic PAP. Herein, we report the case of a 27-year-old woman admitted into our intensive care unit for hypoxemic PAP that was complicated by a pulmonary embolism. Because the patient presented with refractory hypoxemia associated with a brief cardiac arrest, femoral veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was rapidly inserted. Under ECLS, the patient subsequently developed ""Harlequin syndrome"", which was managed using an original and minimally invasive method. A whole lung lavage as well as prone positioning was effectively performed under ECLS, and resulted in substantial improvement in oxygenation.

We addressed this issue in a cohort of 141 patients (previous antimicrobial exposure, n = 131) with a first episode of VAP in a medico-surgical ICU. Twenty-six VAP (18.4%) involved a CR-GNB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, n = 14, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, n = 11, and A. baumannii, n = 1), without previous carbapenem exposure in 12 (46.1%) cases. GNB resistant to all beta-lactams except carbapenems were equally isolated in CR-GNB VAP (co-infections, 23%) and other episodes (30%). Previous exposure to aminoglycosides (odds ratio (OR) 1.14 per day, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.30, p = 0.02) and the number of antimicrobial classes used before VAP (OR 1.38 per class, 95% CI 1.10-1.73, p = 0.006) were the only independent predictors of CR-GNB.

Patients with hematologic diseases are the most risky candidate for S. maltophilia pneumonia or sepsis because of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or immunodeficiency. Frequent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and prolonged insertion of central venous catheter further enhance the risk of S. maltophilia infection. One of the most severe S. maltophilia infections is hemorrhagic pneumonia. This type of infection is mostly fatal because of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage that leads to acute respiratory failure. Furthermore, S. maltophilia exhibits a high-level intrinsic resistance to conventional antibiotics such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides and, more recently, the increasing acquired resistance to co-trimoxazole and quinolones. According to our experienced and previously reported cases, all of the patients with hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia had a fatal course within a few days after the onset of the pneumonia. In this article, we perform a systematic review on a total 30 cases of hemorrhagic pneumonia induced by S. maltophilia from our institutions and the literature, and we describe its early diagnosis, prophylaxis, and recommended therapeutic strategy for the infection in the treatment of hematologic disease.

Susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods. Overall, 12851 isolates were collected (6873/5978 in USA/EMR). The same top 11 organisms were observed in both geographic regions, but in different rank orders, and Gram-negative organisms represented 61.5/76.1% of strains in USA/EMR. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated Gram-negative organism in both regions (20.9/20.9% of cases in USA/EMR) and showed reduced susceptibility to most antimicrobials tested, including ceftazidime (79.6/68.7% susceptibility in USA/EMR), meropenem (76.3/65.8%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (72.9/63.9%). Klebsiella spp. was isolated from 9.7/11.6% of cases and showed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype rates of 19.5/35.1% in USA/EMR. Meropenem and amikacin were active against 62.3/78.7% and 60.8/85.2% of ESBL phenotype Klebsiella spp. from USA/EMR, respectively.

We analyzed a) the incidence and the outcome of pneumonias caused by different pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a medium-sized twenty-four bed community hospital and b) the incidence of complications of such pneumonias requiring surgical intervention such as thoracotomy and decortication. RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients diagnosed with nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia in our ICU. Their bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum cultures, antibiograms, and other clinical characteristics, including complications and need for tracheostomy, thoracotomy and decortication were studied. In a span of one year (2011-12), 43 patients were diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia in our ICU. The median simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) was 39. One or more gram negative organisms as the causative agents were present in 85% of microbiologic samples. The three most prevalent gram negatives were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (34%), Pseudomonas aeurginosa (40%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (32%). Twenty eight percent of bronchoalveolar samples contained Staphylococcus aureus. Eight three percent of patients required mechanical ventilation postoperatively and 37% underwent tracheostony. Thirty five percent underwent thoracotomy and decortication because of further complications such as empyema and non-resolving parapneumonic effusions. A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia extended spectrum beta lactam (ESBL) and P. aeurginosa had the highest prevalence of multi drug resistance (MDR). Fifteen patients required surgical intervention. Mortality from pneumonia was 37% and from surgery was 2%. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial pneumonias, in particular the ones that were caused by gram negative drug resistant organisms and their ensuing complications which required thoracotomy and decortication, were the cause of significant morbidity in our intensive care unit. Preventative and more intensive and novel infection control interventions in reducing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonias are strongly emphasized."

RESULTS: Forty patients (median age, 72 years; 77.5% males) with S. maltophilia infection were identified. The main type of infection was lower respiratory tract infection (97.5%); one patient had a bloodstream infection. A total of 97.5% patients were infected with two or more organisms at the same time. The main characteristics of the patients were prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, urethral catheter, and central venous catheter before the infections occurred. The case number of infection was not different in the four seasons. High in vitro sensitivity was observed to minocycline (91.2%), levofloxacin (85.3%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (79.4%). Most patients received therapy with a combination of agents. The crude mortality was 50%. By multivariate analysis, low albumin content and hypotension were the independent prognostic factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate antimicrobial treatment had no positive impact on mortality. The impacts of albumin supplements and increasing blood pressure on mortality require further clinical studies."

METHODS: The clinical data of 30 cases of autopsy-proven aspiration pneumonia in Beijing Hospital from 1973 to 2002 were reviewed. The patients consisted of 28 males and 2 females, aged from 63 to 103 [mean (83 +- 9)] years. RESULTS: Only 15 cases were clinically diagnosed as aspiration pneumonia before death. Concomitant diseases were severe and complex, mostly coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, COPD, and diabetes mellitus. All the patients suffered from at least 3 concomitant diseases. Long-term bedridden and nasogastric feeding was seen in 11 and 17 patients respectively. The clinical presentation and chest X-ray of aspiration pneumonia in the elderly were nonspecific and variable. Mixed infections were common . The main bacteria isolated were Gram-negative bacilli, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. By pathology, macrophages with foreign bodies were found in all the 30 cases and multiple small abscesses were found in 14 cases. The lesions were adjacent to the bronchioles and in the lung tissue around the bronchioles, mostly multi-lobar and bilateral. Unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion developed in 20 patients. The accordance between radiological and pathological diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia was very poor. The foci of infection detected by X-ray were proven by autopsy in 13 patients, while pleural effusions in X-ray were proven by autopsy in 15 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-concomitant diseases, mixed infection and extra-pulmonary presentations were common in elderly patients with aspiration pneumonia. Multiple small abscesses were the pathological characteristics of aspiration pneumonia in the aged. A definite clinical diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia was difficult. Recurrent silent microaspiration was a feature of aspiration in the elderly. The assessment of risk factor of aspiration played an important role in the clinical diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia."

In a previous study, we established a defined algorithm for treatment of hospital-acquired VAP dictated by the causative pathogen. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of this algorithm for hospital-acquired VAP on recurrence and charges in trauma patients. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with VAP secondary to MRSA, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or Enterobacteriaceae during 5 years subsequent to the previous study were evaluated. All VAP were diagnosed using quantitative cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage effluent. Duration of antimicrobial therapy was dictated by the causative pathogen. If microbiologic resolution, defined as &lt;10(3) colony-forming units/mL, was achieved, therapy was stopped by day 10. The remainder received 14 days of therapy. Recurrence was defined as &gt;10(5) colony-forming units/mL on subsequent bronchoalveolar lavage performed within 2 weeks after completion of appropriate therapy. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-nine VAP episodes were identified in 381 patients. Overall recurrence was unchanged compared with the previous study (1.5% vs 2%; p = 0.3). There was a decrease in the number of bronchoalveolar lavages performed per patient compared with the previous study (1.6 vs 2.3; p = 0.24) and a reduction of 4.8 antibiotic days per VAP episode compared with the previous study. Both changes resulted in a cumulative reduction of $3,535.04 per patient, for a savings of $1.35 million during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired VAP can be managed effectively by a defined course of therapy dictated by the causative pathogen. Adherence to an established algorithm simplified the management of VAP and contributed to a cumulative reduction in patient charges without impacting recurrence."

OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics, microbiological findings and final outcomes of the patients with primary bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The current study retrospectively evaluated patients aged 18 years and above with primary bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia from January 2006 to December 2013. Medical records of patients, including reports of clinical microbiology and hospital infection control committee, were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients with S. maltophilia nosocomial infections, 35 (49.3%) primary bacteremia and 36 (50.7%) pneumonia, were diagnosed. There were no significant differences in gender, age, and co-morbid diseases, except chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; this infection was significantly higher in patients with pneumonia. A slightly higher 14-day mortality was found in patients with pneumonia, but the difference was not statistically significant. Inappropriate antibiotic use and presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome were found as independent risk factors for 14-day mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A slightly higher mortality in patients with pneumonia, caused by S. maltophilia, was strived to explain by advanced age, higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) and sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and also higher inappropriate antibiotic use."

To evaluate the causative bacteria and identify risk factors for BSI associated mortality in febrile neutropenia patients undergoing HSCT, we collected the clinical and microbiological data from patients underwent HSCT between 2008 and 2014 and performed a retrospective analysis. Throughout the study period, among 348 episodes of neutropenic fever in patients underwent HSCT, 89 episodes in 85 patients had microbiological defined BSI with a total of 108 isolates. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were the most common isolates (76, 70.3%) followed by gram-positive bacteria (GPB, 29, 26.9%) and fungus (3, 2.8%). As to the drug resistance, 26 multiple drug resistance (MDR) isolates were identified. Resistant isolates (n = 23) were more common documented in GNB, mostly Escherichia coli (9/36, 25%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (6/24, 25%). A total of 12 isolated were resistant to carbapenem including 4 K pneumoniae (4/24, 16.7%), 3 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other 4 GNB isolates (Citrobacter freumdii, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Chryseobacterium indologenes). As to the GPB, only 3 resistant isolates were documented including 2 methicillin-resistant isolates (Staphylococcus hominis and Arcanobacterium hemolysis) and 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Among these 85 patients with documented BSI, 11 patients died of BSI as primary or associated cause with a BSI-related mortality of 13.1 +- 3.7% and 90-day overall survival after transplantation at 80.0 +- 4.3%. Patients with high-risk disease undergoing allo-HSCT, prolonged neutropenia (&gt;=15 days) and infection with carbapenem-resistant GNB were associated with BSI associated mortality in univariate and multivariate analyses. Our report revealed a prevalence of GNB in BSI of neutropenic patients undergoing HSCT. Patients with high-risk diseases with prolonged neutropenia and carbapenem-resistant GNB were independent risk factors for BSI-related mortality."

The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of co-culture of A. fumigatus and S. maltophilia in respiratory samples of hospitalized patients, and to determine its associated factors. Between 2007 and 2011, all patients who had A. fumigatus in their respiratory samples were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Their clinical and laboratory data, including the presence of S. maltophilia in a respiratory sample, were collected within the same month. Of the 257 enrolled patients (372 respiratory samples), 71 % were immunocompromised and 32 % had chronic respiratory disease. S. maltophilia was isolated within the same month in 20 patients (7.8 %). In the univariate analysis, factors associated with concomitant culture of A. fumigatus and S. maltophilia were liver disease (P = 0.009), orotracheal intubation (P = 0.001), ventilator-associated pneumonia (P = 0.006), central venous catheter (P = 0.003), parenteral nutrition (P = 0.008) and culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in respiratory samples (P = 0.002). In the multivariate analysis, the simultaneous presence of P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract (odds ratio (OR) = 3.19, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.11-9.14, P = 0.031), liver disease (OR = 3.92, 95 % CI 1.32-11.62, P = 0.014) and orotracheal intubation (OR = 3.42, 95 % CI 1.17-9.96, P = 0.024) were independently associated with the co-culture of S. maltophilia and A. fumigatus. Factors independently associated with the concomitant culture of A. fumigatus and S. maltophilia were identified.

Due to the limited therapeutic options, innovative antimicrobial combinations against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae causing severe infections are necessary.A 61-year-old woman with a history of congenital solitary kidney underwent renal transplantation. The postoperative course was complicated by nosocomial pneumonia due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-sensitive Escherichia coli, successfully treated with antimicrobial therapy. On postoperative day 22, diagnosis of surgical site infection and nosocomial pneumonia with concomitant bacteremia due to a Klebisella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producer E coli was made. The patient was treated with the double-carbapenem regimen (high dose of meropenem plus ertapenem) and a potent synergistic and bactericidal activity of this un-conventional therapeutic strategy was observed in vitro. Despite a microbiological response with prompt negativity of blood cultures, the patient faced a worse outcome because of severe hemorrhagic shock.The double-carbapenem regimen might be considered as a rescue therapy in those subjects, including transplant recipients, in whom previous antimicrobial combinations failed or when colistin use might be discouraged.

A retrospective matched case-control study.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is increasingly identified in critically ill patients, but it is considered a pathogen with limited pathogenicity and it is therefore infrequently targeted. This study explores whether S. maltophilia may cause ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and whether it affects intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 28-day mortality when compared to VAP caused by other Gram-negative bacilli. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a 19-year prospectively collected database. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as a cause was considered in VAP-suspected cases when S. maltophilia growth of &gt;=10(4) cfu/ml was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis. Cases were matched on hospital, gender, age and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score in a 1:3 ratio with controls from the same database suffering from VAP caused by other Gram-negative bacilli. RESULTS: Eight cases met the inclusion criteria, of which three were labelled as 'probable' SM-VAP and three as 'possible' SM-VAP. These six patients constitute 1.8% of all VAPs in the studied period. No significant differences in baseline characteristics and duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.68), length of stay in the ICU (p = 0.55) and hospital (p = 0.84) between cases and controls were identified between cases and controls. Intensive care unit mortality odds ratio was 1.7 (p = 0.55; 95% CI 0.3-10.5) and 28-day mortality odds ratio was 1.4 (p = 0.70; 95% CI 0.2-9.1). CONCLUSIONS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a possible, yet infrequent cause of VAP. No outcome differences were found when compared to matched VAP caused by other Gram-negative bacilli."

A retrospective cohort of 157 patients exposed to bronchoscopes from 1 December 2013 to 17 June 2014 was analysed. Environmental samples of suspected endoscopes were cultured. Bronchoscope disinfection was reviewed. Ten cases of pulmonary P. aeruginosa/S. maltophilia co-infections were identified, including two patients with secondary pneumonia. Eight cases were linked to bronchoscope A1 and two to bronchoscope A2. Cultures deriving from suction valves were positive for P. aeruginosa/S. maltophilia. Exposure to bronchoscopes A1 and A2 was independently coupled with increased risk of co-infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 84.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.3-771.6 and aOR = 11.8, 95% CI: 1.2-121.3).

No further cases occurred after discontinuation of the implicated bronchoscopes and change in cleaning procedures. This outbreak of pulmonary P. aeruginosa/S. maltophilia co-infections was caused by suction valve contamination of two bronchoscopes of the same manufacturer.

It affects mainly the skin and mucous membranes. It is a rare condition with a high mortality rate. Fatal outcomes in patients with TEN are mostly due to infectious complications. As antimicrobial drugs may induce this syndrome, the management of this condition is very complicated. Tigecycline is still a relatively new antibiotic approved in Europe for use in complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections. Among major advantages of tigecycline in patients with TEN are its good penetrability into tissues, wide spectrum of activity that makes it suitable for use as monotherapy, and last but not least, in comparison with other antimicrobials, a very low potential for exacerbation of the severity of the underlying disease by further stimulation of the immune system. A case report is presented of a successful management of an 81-year-old woman with TEN and multiple infectious complications in different anatomic locations, the most serious of which was ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Her general condition was further aggravated by Clostridium colitis.

S maltophilia is a glucose nonfermentative, aerobic, gram-negative, mobile, and biofilm-forming bacterium. It is an opportunistic pathogen and uncommon cause of infection. Respiratory tract infections (pneumonia) and bloodstream infections (bacteremia) are the most common clinical manifestations of S maltophilia infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case report describes an unusual case of a rapidly growing, extremely large intraabdominal abscess (within 1 week during antibiotic therapy), which was detected 2 weeks after a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed for perforated appendicitis and was caused by multidrug-resistant S maltophilia infection."

We noted that pneumonia patients with co-infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia had a poor clinical outcome. To verify this, we retrospectively reviewed pneumonia cases at Hebei General Hospital from 2010 to 2015. These cases were grouped into four categories: (1) co-infection with P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia, (2) infection with P. aeruginosa, (3) infection with S. maltophilia and (4) infection with none of the known pneumonia-causing pathogens. The numbers of cases in each group were 50, 40, 41 and 33, with mortality rates of 64.0%, 12.5%, 14.6% and 6.1%, respectively. The analysed results indicated that a co-infection of P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia had a synergic impact on the mortality of pneumonia patients. Therefore, future research is needed to develop treatment strategies for the co-infected patients to reduce the rate of mortality."

METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted. 7 497 patients with respiratory tract infection admitted to Hebei Chest Hospital from January 2013 to December 2016 were enrolled. Deep sputum was collected, and the bacterial cultures and susceptibility analysis was conducted in sputum and upper respiratory secretions were collected by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. RESULTS: A total of 7 497 patients with respiratory tract infection were enrolled in the study, and 11 909 strains of 13 kinds of dominant pathogens were isolated. The dominant pathogens for respiratory tract infection were Monilia albican (23.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.6%), Escherichia coli (9.5%), Candida glabrata (9.1%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.9%), Aspergillus (6.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.5%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (3.7%) and some species of Pseudomonas (3.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%), Aerobacter cloacae (1.9%), and Candida tropicalis (1.8%). A total of 6 198 strains of 7 kinds of Gram negative (G-) bacilli infection dominant pathogens accounts for 52.0% of all infections, Klebsiella pneumonia (24.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.3%), Escherichia coli (18.2%) and Acinetobacter baumanii (15.3%) were the main pathogens, and increased year by year. Susceptibility analysis showed that the preferred antibiotics for G- bacteria were carbapenems, followed by risperidone, sulbactam, cefepime, amikacin, and the third generation of cephalosporins. A total of 798 strains of 2 kinds of Gram positive (G+) bacilli infection dominant pathogens accounted for 6.7% of all infections, were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (54.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (45.2%), each had changed little by year. Susceptibility analysis showed that G+ bacteria were sensitive to glycopeptides, followed by cefoxitin, cotrimoxazole, the tetracyclines, quinolones, azithromycin, erythromycin and so on. The advantages of 4 species of fungi were 4 913 strains, accounted for all of the 41.3% strains, with 57.5% of Candida albicans, and the trend was increasing year by year. Susceptibility analysis results showed that the antifungal susceptibility of dominant fungi were higher. CONCLUSIONS: G- bacilli is still the main source of infection, and showed an upward trend year by year. Fungal infection rate cannot be ignored, and we must pay attention to fungal infection incentives. We should strengthen the rational use of antibiotics."

However, incidence and risk factors for mortality in S. maltophilia bacteremia following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remain controversial. The primary aim of this study is to clarify factors associated with poor prognosis of allo-HSCT recipients with S. maltophilia bacteremia. METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2014, patients with hematological diseases and S. maltophilia bacteremia at a single transplantation center in Japan were examined for incidence and 90-day mortality. Prognostic factors associated with 90-day mortality among allo-HSCT recipients were analyzed by log-rank test, and significant variables in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients, including 47 patients undergoing allo-HSCT, developed S. maltophilia bacteremia. The incidence of S. maltophilia bacteremia was significantly higher in allo-HSCT recipients compared to patients not receiving allo-HSCT (6.53 vs. 0.36 per 100 admissions, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). The overall 90-day mortality in allo-HSCT recipients was 43%. Independent risk factors for 90-day mortality were low serum albumin (&lt;3.0 g/dl) (HR = 10.86; 95% CI, 3.27-36.12) and high serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (&gt;=10.0 mg/dl) (HR = 3.28; 95% CI, 1.00-10.72). Among 9 patients with both high CRP and low albumin, 5 had pneumonia at the onset of bacteremia and the remaining 4 patients developed pneumonia in a median of 3 days (range, 1 to 8 days) even under effective treatment. All 9 patients eventually died in a median of 2 days (range, 2 to 32 days). The probabilities of developing pneumonia in patients with or without high CRP and low albumin levels were 100% (9/9) and 10.5% (4/38), respectively (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Allo-HSCT recipients had higher rates of S. maltophilia bacteremia than did patients not receiving allo-HSCT. High serum CRP and low serum albumin at the onset of bacteremia are predictive of disease progression to pneumonia and poor prognosis."

Because of its unique antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, appropriate antimicrobial therapy for SM bacteremia is still challenging, especially in immunocompromised patients. The present study was performed to assess clinical predictors of SM bacteremia in adult patients with hematologic malignancy. From 2006 through 2016, a case-control study was performed at a tertiary-care hospital. Case patients were defined as SM bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancy. Date- and location-matched controls were selected from among patients with gram-negative bacteremia (GNB) other than SM. A total of 118 cases of SM bacteremia were identified and compared to 118 controls. While pneumonia was the most common source of SM bacteremia, centralline-associated infection was most common in the controls. The overall 30-day mortality rate of cases with SM bacteremia was significantly higher than that of the controls (61.0 and 32.2%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). A multivariable analysis showed that polymicrobial infection, previous SM isolation, the number of antibiotics previously used &gt;= 3, and breakthrough bacteremia during carbapenem therapy were significantly associated with SM bacteremia (all P &lt; 0.01). Previous use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was negatively association with SM bacteremia (P = 0.002). Our data suggest that SM is becoming a significant pathogen in patients with hematologic malignancy. Several clinical predictors of SM bacteremia can be used for appropriate antimicrobial therapy in hematologic patients with suspected GNB."

Most of them are identified as opportunistic, nosocomial pathogens in patients. Uncommon species are identified accurately, mainly due to the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical microbiology practice. Most of these uncommon non-fermenting rods are isolated from lower respiratory tract samples. Their significance in lower respiratory tract infections, such as rules of their testing are not clarified yet. AIM: The aim of this study was to review the clinical microbiological features of these bacteria, especially their roles in lower respiratory tract infections and antibiotic treatment options. METHOD: Lower respiratory tract samples of 3589 patients collected in a four-year period (2013-2016) were analyzed retrospectively at Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). Identification of bacteria was performed by MALDI-TOF MS, the antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was revealed to be the second, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii the third most common non-fermenting rod in lower respiratory tract samples, behind the most common Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total number of uncommon non-fermenting Gram-negative isolates was 742. Twenty-three percent of isolates were Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Beside Chryseobacterium, Rhizobium, Delftia, Elizabethkingia, Ralstonia and Ochrobactrum species, and few other uncommon species were identified among our isolates. The accurate identification of this species is obligatory, while most of them show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides. Resistance to ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems was frequently observed also. CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found to be the most effective antibiotic agents. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(1): 23-30."

METHODS: Patients with S. maltophilia BSI or pneumonia admitted from 1 Jan. 2000 to 31 Dec. 2016 were identified at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), a tertiary-care oncology hospital in Mexico City. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 171 isolates identified. The mean age of the whole group was 46.9 +- 17.4 years; 99 (57.9%) were women. There were 95 BSI: 64 ambulatory catheter-related BSI (CRBSI), 20 nosocomial CRBSI, and 11 secondary BSI. Mortality was higher in nosocomial CRBSI (40%) vs. that in ambulatory CRBSI (7.8%) (p = 0.001). There were 76 pneumonia episodes; all were nosocomial acquired; 46 (60.5%) ventilator-associated. From all the group, nine strains (5.2%) were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim/(SMX/TMP). At the first month, 54 patients (31.6%) have died, 38 due to pneumonia (70%) and 16 due to BSI (30%, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that removal of central venous catheter was associated with a favorable outcome in patients with bacteremia. For patients with pneumonia, age &gt;= 65 years and inappropriate antimicrobial treatment were risk factors associated with 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia related with ambulatory CRBSI have a better prognosis than other sources of BSI. Older patients with pneumonia who do not receive appropriate antibiotics have higher mortality. SMX/TMP is still the antibiotic of choice."

The aim of this study was to determine susceptibility patterns of organisms causing VAP to develop a treatment algorithm based on these findings and evidence from the literature. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective analysis of the microbiological etiology of VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a Lebanese tertiary care hospital from July 2015 to July 2016. We reviewed the latest clinical practice guidelines on VAP and tried to adapt these recommendations to our setting. Results: In all, 43 patients with 61 VAP episodes were identified, and 75 bacterial isolates caused VAP. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common organism (37%), and it had occurred endemically throughout the year. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the next most common organism (31%), and 13% were XDR. Enterobacteriaceae (15%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (12%) shared similar incidences. Our algorithm was based on guidelines, in addition to trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that studied the effectiveness of available antibiotics in treating VAP.

Madagascar is the leading country for human plague cases worldwide. Human plague is a serious disease, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms. We report a case of pneumonic plague co-infected by a MDR-Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24 year-old man originated from Soavinandriana, a plague focus, felt uneasy and developed high fever with chills. He started treatment by himself, by private medical care and by a traditional healer for nine days moving several times from place to place. His condition had deteriorated when he presented to a district hospital with a syndrome of dyspnea, bronchial rale and altered state of consciousness. Two days later, plague diagnosis, performed as a last resort, revealed a positive F1 antigen on rapid diagnostic test. Additional tests (pla PCR and plague serology) evidenced a Y. pestis infection. However, streptomycin treatment did not achieve a complete recovery as the course of disease was complicated by the presence of MDR-S. maltophilia in his lung. This opportunistic infection could have been favored by an immunosuppression due to Y. pestis pulmonary infection and probably been acquired during his stay at a District Hospital. He was treated with a combination of ciprofloxacin and gentamycin and recovered fully. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonic plague infection may promote another virulent or avirulent bacterial infection particularly when it is not initially suspected. However, coinfection is rarely described and its occurrence frequency is unknown. In middle or low resources areas, which is the case of most plague endemic countries, control and prevention of infections in health facilities is not optimal. Co-infection with an opportunistic pathogen agent, such as S. maltophilia, is a risk which must not be disregarded as demonstrated by this case report. When deciding of a national control strategy, it should be taken into account in the choice of the first line treatment."

SMB cases of patients with a hematologic malignancy were collected from 2006 through 2016. The overall 30-day mortality rate and mortality risk factors were assessed. The expression of major virulence-associated genes from S. maltophilia isolates, which included genes encoding type-1 fimbriae (smf-1), proteases (StmPr1 and StmPr2), and esterase (Smlt3773), from the blood of patients with HP and CRBSI was investigated. The phenotypic and genotypic traits were also compared. A total of 118 cases of SMB were included. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 61.0%. A multivariable analysis showed that HP was the most important risk factor for mortality (adjusted OR = 106.41; 95% CI = 5.18-2184.55).

Gram-positive (G+) bacteria accounted for 6.48% (7/108), of which Staphylococcus aureus was 4.63% (5/108); and fungi was 7.41% (8/108). Drug resistance analysis showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100% sensitive to amikacin (AMK), meropenem (MEM) and polymyxin (POL), and were suggested as the preferred drug. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% sensitive to AMK, tobramycin (TOB) and POL, but 100% resistant to compound trimethoprim (PCST). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was 100% sensitive to PCST and 100% resistant to AMK, piperacillin (PIP), piperacillin tazobactam (TZP) and TOB. Acinetobacter baumannii was 100% sensitive to cefoxitin (FOX), cefuroxime (CXM) and POT. Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to gentamicin (GEN), furantoin (NIT), rifampicin (RIF), vancomycin (VAN) and teicoplanin (TEC), while the drug resistance to clindamycin (CLI) and penicillin (PEN) was high (both 80.00%). Most pathogens were multidrug-resistant. The mortality of patients with multidrug resistant bacteria infection was significantly higher than that of non-multidrug resistant bacteria infection [51.85% (28/52) vs. 30.56% (11/36), chi 2 = 4.240, P = 0.046]. CONCLUSIONS: VAP was associated with brain injury and cerebrovascular accident, duration of mechanical ventilation &lt; 7 days, albumin &gt; 28 g/L and tracheotomy. VAP patients were infected mainly with G- bacteria and showed multiple drug resistance."

We evaluated the frequency and resistance rates of Acb complex and S. maltophilia isolates from medical centers enrolled in the SENTRY Program. Methods: A total of 13 752 Acb complex and 6467 S. maltophilia isolates were forwarded to a monitoring laboratory by 259 participating sites from the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, Europe, and North America between 1997 and 2016. Confirmation of species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using conventional methods and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and the broth microdilution method, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted by CLSI and EUCAST 2018 criteria. Results: Acb complex and S. maltophilia were most frequently isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia (42.9% and 55.8%, respectively) and bloodstream infections (37.3% and 33.8%, respectively). Colistin and minocycline were the most active agents against Acb complex (colistin MIC50/90, &lt;=0.5/2 mg/L; 95.9% susceptible) and S. maltophilia (minocycline MIC50/90, &lt;=1/2 mg/L; 99.5% susceptible) isolates, respectively. Important temporal decreases in susceptibility rates among Acb complex isolates were observed for all antimicrobial agents in all regions. Rates of extensively drug-resistant Acb complex rates were highest in Europe (66.4%), followed by Latin America (61.5%), Asia-Pacific (56.9%), and North America (38.8%). Among S. maltophilia isolates, overall trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) susceptibility rates decreased from 97.2% in 2001-2004 to 95.7% in 2013-2016, but varied according to the geographic region. Conclusions: We observed important reductions of susceptibility rates to all antimicrobial agents among Acb complex isolates obtained from all geographic regions. In contrast, resistance rates to TMP-SMX among S. maltophilia isolates remained low and relatively stable during the study period."

The aim of this study was to evaluate a nosocomial outbreak of by S. maltophilia in an intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital and evaluate unexpected multiclonality. Methods: A total of 11 isolates from respiratory cultures in intensive care unit of a 24 bed tertiary hospital obtained over a one months period and one isolate obtained from the nebuliser during environmental screening were investigated. The bacteria were identified by Phoenix 100 system. The clonal relatedness was evaluated by PFGE and semi-automated repetitive sequence-based PCR. Genotyping tests were repeated for 10 serial subcultures. Results: PFGE and DiversiLab yielded 10 genotypic profiles for 12 isolates. Four to eight different genotypes were observed from 10 subcultures of the same isolate. Conclusion: We conclude that, high genetic diversity and supposed multiclonal appearance of the outbreak isolates may be due to changing profiles during subcultures most probably depending on hypermutation."

Studies have demonstrated treatment failures and resistance development with monotherapy (MT); however, clinical data are limited with combination therapy (CT). OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical outcomes with CT versus MT for S. maltophilia pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between November 2011 and October 2017 with S. maltophilia pneumonia who received at least 48 h of effective therapy. The primary outcome was clinical response after 7 days of effective therapy with CT versus MT. Secondary outcomes included development of a non-susceptible isolate, 30 day microbiological cure, infection recurrence, infection-related mortality and all-cause mortality. The Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Pearson chi2 test and Fisher's exact test were utilized for univariate analyses. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess clinical response while adjusting for confounding variables. RESULTS: Of 252 patients with S. maltophilia pneumonia included, 38 received CT and 214 received MT. There was no difference in 7 day clinical response with CT versus MT (47.4% versus 39.7%, P = 0.38), even after controlling for immune status, APACHE II score and polymicrobial pneumonia (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.63-3.65). Thirty day microbiological cure (P = 0.44), recurrence (P = 0.53), infection-related mortality (P = 0.19) and isolation of a non-susceptible isolate during or after therapy (P = 1.00 each) were also similar between both groups; however, 30 day all-cause mortality was greater with CT (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: CT had similar rates of clinical efficacy and resistance development compared with MT for S. maltophilia pneumonia."

This rise has ambiguous dynamics and essential local epidemiologic data is lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study at the 400-bed Saint George Hospital (SGH) in Beirut, Lebanon, we retrieved electronic laboratory records of all intrinsic and acquired CRO isolates from January 1, 2010 until June 30, 2018. Isolation density was calculated as: number of isolates/1000PD. Analysis carried out using WHOnet with a trend time series analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 2150 non-duplicate CRO were isolated. While Acinetobacter baumanii (AB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPa), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm) constituted 85% of total CRO in the study period, the carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) rose from few sporadic cases before 2016 to a solid 32% of total CRO in 2018. Our most concrete trends were as follows. The rate of AB bacteremia was at an average of 0.114/1000 PD from 2011 to 2014. In 2015, a sudden doubling of AB bacteremia to 0.23/1000 PD. In 2017, there was a significant decrease to 0.113/1,000PD (p &lt; 0.0001) to reach 0.097/1000PD in 2018 with a continuously declining trend. The peak of Sm bacteremia was in 2016 at 0.121/1000PD after which it significantly decreased by 21% in 2017 to disappear in 2018 (p &lt; 0.0001). There were no significant trends observed in the isolation density of the CRPa group from 2010 until June 2018. Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKp) bacteremia was isolated first in 2013, then in 2016 and continued to rise (p = 0.028). In 2017, carbapenem resistant KP bacteremia rate doubled to 0.05/1,000PD from 0.024/1000 (p = 0.0139). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this 9-year study at SGH depicts the major trends and dynamics of local CRO isolation, mainly A. baumanii, P. aeruginosa and CRKp. Further efforts are warranted both locally and internationally for a richer understanding of this trend. Bearing in mind that understanding antimicrobial resistance is a complex, multifaceted process that is only feasible when all its aspects are combined: molecular, phenotypic and clinical."

Herein, we describe an unusual case of an avian influenza A (H7N9) infection with several severe mixed bacterial infections and systemic super-infection with Cryptococcus neoformans presenting as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infection in a previously immunocompetent man during hospitalization.A 58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of hyperpyrexia, dyspnoea, cough, and phlegm with blood. A chest computed tomography scan revealed multiple ground-glass opacities and consolidation in both lungs with right pleural effusion. An initial sputum test was positive for influenza A (H7N9) virus. After antiviral treatment and other supportive measures, the patient's condition improved. However, the patient's condition deteriorated again approximately 2 weeks after admission, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole was started. After a 2-week antifungal treatment, BALF and blood cultures were negative for C. neoformans. However, the patient had persistent lung infiltrates with severe pulmonary fibrosis with a prolonged course of disease. On hospital day 40, BALF and blood cultures were both positive for multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Finally, the patient developed septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure and succumbed to treatment failure.Cryptococcal infection can occur in patients with severe influenza during hospitalization with a more severe condition, and the clinician should be aware of this infection."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the features of the etiological structure of neonatal pneumonia complicated by BPD, and to determine the sensitivity of pathogens to antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 194 preterm infants with VAP, birth weight from 780 to 2820 g and gestational age from 27 to 37 weeks was conducted. A microbiological study of washings from the respiratory tract was conducted by standard qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Respiratory tract infections caused by E. coli (with hemolytic properties), Enterococcus spp. (with hemolytic properties), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, various types of mycoplasmas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida krusei were found 4- 13 times more frequent in preterm infants with BPD than in preterm infants without BPD and more mature infants with or without this complication. BPD developed 7- 11 times more frequent in preterm infants with prolonged VAP and change in pathogens than in preterm infants with VAP without change of agent. BPD developed 5- 7 times more frequent in preterm infants with the association of pathogens than in preterm infants with a monoinfection. Massive colonization of respiratory tract pathogens by 1- 3 days of life (lg4 colony forming units in 1 ml and above) was an unfavorable prognostic factor for the development of VAP, complicated by BPD. CONCLUSION: The reduction in the frequency of BPD is might be possible with timeous and adequate antibacterial therapy of VAP."

The drug of choice in S maltophilia infections is sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP); SMX/TMP resistance is a serious concern in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of S maltophilia in lower respiratory tract (LRTI) samples at a tertiary-care university hospital. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was carried out using microbiological data collected between January 2008 and December 2017. Routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for SMX/TMP and levofloxacin; in case of resistance, susceptibility testing for additional antibiotics (tigecycline, amikacin, and colistin) was also performed. Results: A total of 579 individual S maltophilia isolates were identified (2008-2012: n = 160, 2013-2017: n = 419; P = .0008). In all, 78.46% of patients were younger than 5 or older than 50 years of age and had recent trauma, surgery, or underlying conditions (malignancies, respiratory distress syndrome, congenital disorders, and cystic fibrosis). In 28.16% of samples, more than 1 pathogen was identified, and 5.35% of coisolated pathogens were multidrug resistant (MDR). In all, 12.1% of isolates were SMX/TMP-resistant (2008-2012: 6.12%, 2013-2017: 18.06%; P = .034), while 8.99% were resistant to levofloxacin (2008-2012: 7.86%, 2013-2017: 10.12%; P &gt; .05). SMX/TMP resistance was detected more frequently in samples originating from inpatients (n = 2.50 +- 2.39 vs n = 11.50 +- 3.76; P = .0002). Conclusions: In all, 5.87% of isolates were extensively drug resistant (XDR), that is, in addition to SMX/TMP, they were resistant to levofloxacin, amikacin, colistin, and tigecycline. The results of our study correspond to the findings in the literature."

Although great advances have been achieved in diagnostic approaches, it remains challenging to identify pathogens in unexplained pneumonia (UP) cases. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and a metagenomic approach to detect and characterize respiratory bactiera in an UP case in infant. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the only bacterial pathogen detected in blood.

This study aim to identify risk factors for SM ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and whether it affects ICU mortality METHODS: Two nested matched case-control studies were performed based in OUTCOMEREA database. The first episodes of SM-VAP patients were matched with two different control groups: VAP due to other micro-organisms (VAP-other) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP (Pyo-VAP). Matching criteria were the hospital, the SAPS II, and the previous duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: Of the 102 SM-VAP patients (6.2% of all VAP patients), 92 were matched with 375 controls for the SM-VAP/other-VAP matching and 84 with 237 controls for the SM-VAP/Pyo-VAP matching. SM-VAP risk factors were an exposition to ureido/carboxypenicillin or carbapenem during the week before VAP, and respiratory and coagulation components of SOFA score upper to 2 before VAP. SM-VAP received early adequate therapy in 70 cases (68.6%). Risk factors for Day-30 were age (OR = 1.03; p < 0.01) and Chronic heart failure (OR = 3.15; p < 0.01). Adequate treatment, either monotherapy or combination of antimicrobials, did not modify mortality. There was no difference in 30-day mortality, but 60-day mortality was higher in patients with SM-VAP compared to Other-VAP (P = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: In a large series, independent risk factors for the SM-VAP were ureido/carboxypenicillin or carbapenem exposure the week before VAP, and respiratory and coagulation components of the SOFA score > 2 before VAP.

The optimal modalities of antimicrobial therapy remain to be determined. Our objective was to describe the epidemiology and prognostic factors associated with S. maltophilia pneumonia, focusing on antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective study included all patients admitted to 25 French mixed intensive care units between 2012 and 2017 with hospital-acquired S. maltophilia HAP during intensive care unit stay. Primary endpoint was time to in-hospital death. Secondary endpoints included microbiologic effectiveness and antimicrobial therapeutic modalities such as delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment, mono versus combination therapy, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Of the 282 patients included, 84% were intubated at S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis for duration of 11 [5-18] days. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 47 [36-63], and the in-hospital mortality was 49.7%. Underlying chronic pulmonary comorbidities were present in 14.1% of cases. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was considered effective on S. maltophilia according to susceptibility patterns in only 30% of cases. Delay to appropriate antimicrobial treatment had, however, no significant impact on the primary endpoint. Survival analysis did not show any benefit from combination antimicrobial therapy (HR = 1.27, 95%CI [0.88; 1.83], p = 0.20) or prolonged antimicrobial therapy for more than 7 days (HR = 1.06, 95%CI [0.6; 1.86], p = 0.84). No differences were noted in in-hospital death irrespective of an appropriate and timely empiric antimicrobial therapy between mono- versus polymicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.273). The duration of ventilation prior to S. maltophilia HAP diagnosis and ICU length of stay were shorter in patients with monomicrobial S. maltophilia HAP (p = 0.031 and p = 0.034 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: S. maltophilia HAP occurred in severe, long-stay intensive care patients who mainly required prolonged invasive ventilation.

We reviewed the PubMed database to identify the common organisms implicated in HAP/VAP, to explore the respective risk factors, and to find the appropriate antibiotic choice. Apart from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp., MDR or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-Acinetobacter baumannii complex spp., followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Chryseobacterium indologenes, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica are ranked as the top Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) implicated in HAP/VAP. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae notably emerged as an important concern in HAP/VAP. The above-mentioned pathogens have respective risk factors involved in their acquisition. In the present XDR era, tigecycline, colistin, and ceftazidime-avibactam are antibiotics effective against the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and oxacillinase producers amongst the Enterobacteriaceae isolates implicated in HAP/VAP. Antibiotic combination regimens are recommended in the treatment of MDR/XDR-P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii complex isolates.

However, the clinical features of children with S. maltophilia infection, the predisposing factors, and the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria have not been fully evaluated.In this study, the data of children with S. maltophilia infection from the West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University (Chengdu, China) between July 2010 and October 2017 were collected and analyzed. The clinical features of enrolled children, the predisposing factors, and the antibiotic susceptibility were reported.In total, infection of S. maltophilia was identified in 128 patients. Most of these patients were under 1 year old (67.2%) and were mainly diagnosed as pneumonia (69%). A large proportion had underlying diseases (45.3%), received immunosuppressive therapy (53.1%), had undergone invasive operations (41.4%), had a history of carbapenem antibiotics use within 7 days before culture acquisition (54.7%), history of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization within previous 30 days (34.4%), and other risk factors. In particular, invasive operation (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.125-14.324, P = .032), especially mechanical ventilation (95% CI: 1.277-20.469, P = .021), and ICU admission (95% CI: 1.743-22.956, P = .005) were independent risk factors for the children to develop severe S. maltophilia infection.

It produces a biofilm and has intrinsic resistance to a wide array of broad-spectrum agents. Risk factors include neonate or immunocompromised states, intensive care unit admission for more than 21 days, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, indwelling devices, and mechanical ventilation. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old cachectic man presented in the United States with community-acquired pneumonia and immediately decompensated, requiring ventilator support. Despite starting broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient developed fever, leukocytosis, and additional desaturation episodes. The patient's respiratory culture grew numerous C. gleum and few Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. He also had a positive urine streptococcal pneumonia antigen. Broad-spectrum agents were discontinued after prolonged treatment due to a continued worsening clinical picture, and the patient was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cover C. gleum. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with resolution of symptoms on post-discharge follow-up. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a documented case of a patient with C. gleum respiratory infection successfully treated solely with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The expedient identification of C. gleum is essential for proper treatment. The literature has consistently shown isolated respiratory C. gleum strains to be largely susceptible to fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."

The aim of this study was to analyze the results of surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 2013-2017 and to compare with those obtained during 2006-2010. METHODS: The surveillance included 1265 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with > 2 days NICU stay. Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions adapted to neonatal pathology. RESULTS: A total of 125 HAIs were registered during 2013-2017 with a frequency of 9.9% and an incidence density of 3.2 per 1000 patient days. HAIs occurred in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes (p = < 0.001). Central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) was the most frequent infection (69.6%), followed by ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (20%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (8.8%) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (1.6%). Also, CLABSI and VAP incidence density decreased from lower to highest BW classes showing a significant trend (p = 0.007). Most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSI were: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (25.3%), Candida parapsilosis (21.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 20.7% of CLABSI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%) were the most frequent pathogens responsible for VAP. CLABSI incidence density showed no differences between 2006 and 2010 and 2013-2017, while VAP incidence density for the 751-100 g BW class was higher during 2006-2010 than during 2013-2017 (p = 0.006). A higher incidence of the CLABSI caused by Gram positive bacteria (p = 0.002) or by undetermined etiology (p = 0.01) was observed during 2013-2017 than during 2006-2010, while a significant lower incidence of VAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria was found during 2013-2017 than during 2006-2010 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: HAIs in the NICU developed in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes in both study periods. Differences in the aetiology of CLABSI and VAP were found between the two study periods. This reinforces the importance of HAIs surveillance protocol in the NICU, which monitors microbiological isolates and use of medical devices for all BW classes of neonates."

On another front, point-of-care infection diagnostic methods at the bedside are significantly lacking. Here, we used a newly developed protocol of integrating an exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection device (PKU BioScreen) and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to investigate what bacterial pathogens can be directly exhaled out from humans. Exhaled breath condensates were collected from human subjects with respiratory infection symptoms at Peking University 3rd hospital using the BioScreen. The screened bacterial pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Stphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma Pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results were further compared and validated using throat swabs from the same patients by a PCR method. Here, human bacterial pathogens such as H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA were detected in exhaled breath using the developed protocol that integrates the EBC collection and LAMP. For the patients recruited from the hospital, seven types of pathogens were detected from 36.5% of them, and for the remaining subjects none of those screened bacterial pathogens was detected. Importantly, some super resistant bacteria such as MRSA were detected from the exhaled breath, suggesting that breathing might be also an important bacterial transmission route. Results from throat swabs showed that 36.2% of the subjects were found to be infected with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia, S. aureus and MRSA. For the EBC samples, 33.3% were found to be infected with MRSA, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Depending on the initial pathogen load in the sample, the entire protocol (EBC-LAMP) only takes 20-60 min to complete for a respiratory infection diagnosis. For different detection methods and pathogens, the agreements between the EBC and throat swabs from the same patients were found to range from 35% to 65%. Here, we have detected several bacterial pathogens including MRSA from exhaled breath, and the developed protocol could be very useful for the bedside pathogen screening particularly in remote areas where resources are significantly limited or prohibited."

S. maltophilia is typically treated with high-dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP). However, SMX/TMP and other treatment options for S. maltophilia can be limited because of resistance, allergy, adverse events or unavailability of the drug; use of novel agents may be necessary to adequately treat this MDR infection and overcome these limitations. CASE DESCRIPTION: This small case series describes two patients who underwent treatment with tigecycline for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by S. maltophilia after admission to a trauma intensive care unit. At the time of admission for the two reported patients, a national drug shortage of intravenous (IV) SMX/TMP prevented its use. Tigecycline was chosen as a novel agent to treat S. maltophilia VAP based on culture and susceptibility data, and it was used successfully. Both patients showed clinical signs of improvement with eventual cure and discharge from the hospital after treatment with tigecycline, and one patient demonstrated confirmed microbiological cure with a negative repeat bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this small case series is the first documentation of utilizing tigecycline to treat S. maltophilia VAP in the United States. Although it likely should not be considered as a first-line agent, tigecycline proved to be an effective treatment option in the two cases described in the setting of a national drug shortage of the drug of choice."

An imaging study of the chest was suggestive of deterioration of pneumonia, with increased opacities. Initial respiratory cultures were negative, while subsequent repeat cultures revealed the growth of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia susceptible to trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin. The patient had a poor prognosis and eventually died despite appropriate measures. CONCLUSIONS A decline in the clinical status of a patient such as ours makes it hard to quickly diagnose this organism correctly.

Western Rajasthan has cases of Cystic fibrosis due to migrant population. The dry and dusty environment has led to prevalence of silicosis and COPD. As per IDSA (2018) guidelines, patients attending Out-Patient Department do not need microbiological investigations for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) except for influenza and tuberculosis. Aims: This study was conducted to identify the bacterial aetiology of LRTI among patients who attended AIIMS, Jodhpur, and to ascertain the current scenario of bacterial susceptibility in respiratory tract infections in order to optimize empiric therapy in Hospitals ad community. Methods and Material: In total, 1,775 lower respiratory tract samples were received in Bacteriology Section of Microbiology Department (January 2017 to December 2018). Bartlett's criteria were stringently used to assess quality of specimen. Semiquantitative cultures were done for tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Following culture, the isolated organisms were identified and antimicrobial sensitivity was performed according to CLSI. Results: Total 769 bacterial pathogens were isolated from 1,775 samples collected from cases of VAP, HAP, CAP, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas species was the commonest isolate (31%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (21.3%), Acinetobacter species (17.5%), Escherichia coli (15.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5%). Others include Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Nocardia. Gram-negative organisms showed increased resistance to routinely used antibiotics. Gram-positive organisms showed 100% susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, and clindamycin. Conclusions: Cotrimoxazole, betaL-betaLIs, aminoglycosides, and all second-line antibiotics tested were effective for treatment of RTIs."

However, other opportunistic bacterial pathogens like Achromobacter xylosoxidans complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and non-tuberculous mycobacteria are currently emerging in CF and are also reported in non-CF bronchiectasis. BACKGROUND: The emergence of opportunistic bacterial pathogens has been recognized in CF through annual national reports of sputum microbiology data. Despite common factors driving the emergence of bacteria identified in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients, bronchiectasis registries have been created more recently and no longitudinal analysis of recorded microbiological data is currently available in the literature, thereby preventing the recognition of emerging bacteria in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. OUTLOOK: A longitudinal follow-up of microbiological data is still needed in non-CF bronchiectasis to identify emerging opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Homogeneity in practice of sputum microbiological examination is also required to allow comparative analysis of data in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pathogens recognized as emerging in CF have to be more carefully monitored in non-CF bronchiectasis in view of their association with deterioration of the lung disease."

The increasing incidence is of particular concern in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Since 2012, the Western France has witnessed high annual prevalence of S. maltophilia colonization/infection. This retrospective cohort study investigated the epidemiology of S. maltophilia emergence in the CF center of Roscoff, Western France, a region of high prevalence of CF in Europe. METHODS: All CF patients with S. maltophilia isolated in respiratory samples between December 2013 and February 2017 were included. For each patient the colonization status with S. maltophilia was determined. The epidemiological and microbiological characteristics collected were compared between colonization statuses. RESULTS: S. maltophilia was isolated in 90 patients (42 males, 48 females). Mean age at first colonization was 24.4+-13.5 years. Annual prevalence since 2013 was high (16-17.9%), but stable. This high prevalence is mainly due to a high rate of intermittent colonization. Only 2.8% of CF patients showed chronic colonization, with significantly more frequent co-colonization by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (P<0.0001) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P<0.05). During chronic colonization, S. maltophilia acquired resistance to cotrimoxazole and beta-lactams. Interestingly, there were cases of decolonization. CONCLUSION: This is the first epidemiological report of S. maltophilia in a French CF center. Prevalence was stable but above the national average. Most cases were intermittent; chronic colonization was rare."

Concurrent infection, which may require administration of a potentially nephrotoxic agent, can worsen AKI and lead to poor outcomes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus associated with nosocomial infections, especially in severely immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination (TMP/SMX) is considered the treatment of choice but can itself lead to AKI, posing a significant challenge in the management of patients with concomitant COVID-19 and S. maltophilia pneumonia. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and post renal transplant presented with severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was intubated upon admission. His renal functions were normal at the time of admission. The patient subsequently developed superimposed bacterial pneumonia with S. maltophilia requiring administration of TMP/SMX. However, TMP/SMX led to the development of AKI, which continued to worsen despite appropriate management including hemodialysis. This coincided with and most likely resulted in the patient's clinical deterioration and ultimate death. CONCLUSIONS The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving and appears to be multifactorial. The condition can significantly worsen especially when nephrotoxic agents are given, probably due to a cumulative or synergistic effect. Great caution should be taken when administering nephrotoxic agents in the setting of COVID-19 as it can lead to adverse patient outcomes."

Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 22 children who were diagnosed with CF associated ABPA in Beijing Children's Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from March 2010 to March 2020. The clinical features, imaging characteristics, laboratory results and the prognosis were reviewed. Results: A total of 22 cases met the diagnostic criterion, including 12 males and 10 females. The age of diagnosis was (10.4+-2.8) years and the age of onset was (5.5+-4.4) years. Clinical manifestations included cough and expectoration (22 cases), recurrent wheezing (15 cases), hemoptysis (7 cases), failure to thrive (12 cases), pancreatitis (10 cases), hepatomegaly (7 cases), splenomegaly (4 cases) and steatorrhea (4 cases). CT scans of all the patients showed pulmonary infiltrates and central bronchiectasis, combined with mucoid impaction in 17 cases and high density mucus plug in 12 cases. Eosinophilia was found in 18 patients. Total IgE and serum levels of A. fumigatus-specific IgE were elevated in all 22 patients. Positive culture of sputum or bronchoalvedar lauage fluid for fungus were in 15 cases, with single Aspergillus infection in 8 cases and mixed Aspergillus infection in 3 cases. The predominant bacteria found in the airways were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), followed by staphylococcas. aureus (6 cases) and stenotrophomonas. maltophilia (5 cases). Pulmonary function revealed obstructive ventilation dysfunction in 4 cases, mixed dysfunction in 11 cases, and small airway dysfunction in 4 cases. Regarding the treatment, 3 were treated only with systemic corticosteroid, while the remaining 19 cases also received antifungal agents.The follow up continued for 1-7 years, and 6 maintained remission, 10 had recurrent episodes, 1 died, and 5 lost to follow up. Conclusions: CF associated ABPA is extremely rare in China. The overlapping clinical, radiographic, and immunologic features of these two diseases make the diagnosis challenging. Systemic corticosteroids are considered the first-line therapy for these patients, and adjuvant antifungal agents may be helpful. Recurrence rate in our center is high."

Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are the most important specimens obtained from patients with LRI. The choice of antibiotic with which to treat LRI usually depends on the antimicrobial sensitivity of bacteria isolated from sputum and BALF. However, differences in the antimicrobial sensitivity of pathogens isolated from sputum and BALF have not been evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the differences between sputum and BALF samples in terms of pathogen isolation and antimicrobial sensitivity in hospitalized patients with LRI. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, quality evaluation of sputum samples was not conducted before performing sputum culture; however, between 2016 and 2018, quality evaluation of sputum samples was conducted first, and only quality-assured samples were cultured. The numbers of sputum and BALF in 2013-2015 were 15,549 and 1671, while those in 2016-2018 were 12,055 and 3735, respectively. The results of pathogen culture showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were in the top ten pathogens isolated from sputum and BALF. An antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that the susceptibility of BALF isolates to most antibiotics was higher compared with the susceptibility of sputum isolates, especially after quality control of sputum samples (2016-2018). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that caution is needed in making therapeutic choices for patients with LRI when using antimicrobial sensitivity results from sputum isolates as opposed to BALF isolates."

To our knowledge, there are few reported cases of S maltophilia being the causative pathogen of infection in a diabetic foot wound. METHODS: Following multiple surgical procedures and deep tissue cultures, S maltophilia was determined to be a secondary opportunistic colonizer of the wound, necessitating a change in antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: The cultured pathogen was sensitive to ceftazidime, levofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The treatment team chose to use ceftazidime, as it also provided antibiotic coverage for the initial wound and blood cultures. Change in antibiotic therapy was initiated following multiple surgical procedures and angioplasty of the lower limb. The patient was discharged with a peripheral intravenous central catheter for outpatient antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics in individuals with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus provides an advantageous environment for growth of uncommon multidrug-resistant organisms. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia may complicate the treatment of diabetic foot infections as an opportunistic pathogen. Understanding the implication of long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment in the diabetic patient is important in managing postoperative complications and determining the correct course of treatment. The emergence of atypical pathogens in diabetic wounds must be managed appropriately."

However, currently there are no available mouse models of hemorrhagic pneumonia. In the present study, we generated a mouse model of hemorrhagic pneumonia and subjected the animals to treatment with levofloxacin and moxifloxacin to determine if this model can be used to determine therapeutic effects. METHODS: S. maltophilia was transtracheally administered to mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide. We confirmed its pathological status and assessed whether therapeutic effects of quinolone antibiotics could be studied using the model. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were then administered to evaluate survival rate, bacterial load in the lungs and cardiac blood, as well as pathological changes in diseased lungs compared with those of the control group. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic pneumonia developed within 16-24 h after bacterial infection and was confirmed pathologically. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin significantly improved survival rates, decreased the bacterial load in lungs and cardiac blood, and improved hemorrhagic pneumonia as indicated by pathological examination. CONCLUSIONS: We established a mouse model of rapidly progressive fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia which is useful for determining the therapeutic effect of various agents. We believe that this model will prove useful to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying hemorrhagic pneumonia, as well as in the design and development of novel therapeutic modalities and targets."

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as one of the most common multi-drug-resistant pathogens isolated from people with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, its adaptation over time to CF lungs has not been fully established.Hypothesis. Sequential isolates of S. maltophilia from a Brazilian adult patient are clonally related and show a pattern of adaptation by loss of virulence factors.Aim. To investigate antimicrobial susceptibility, clonal relatedness, mutation frequency, quorum sensing (QS) and selected virulence factors in sequential S. maltophilia isolates from a Brazilian adult patient attending a CF referral centre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between May 2014 and May 2018.Methodology. The antibiotic resistance of 11 S. maltophilia isolates recovered from expectorations of an adult female with CF was determined. Clonal relatedness, mutation frequency, QS variants (RpfC-RpfF), QS autoinducer (DSF) and virulence factors were investigated in eight viable isolates.Results. Seven S. maltophilia isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and five to levofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to minocycline. Strong, weak and normomutators were detected, with a tendency to decreased mutation rate over time. XbaI PFGE revealed that seven isolates belong to two related clones. All isolates were RpfC-RpfF1 variants and DSF producers. Only two isolates produced weak biofilms, but none displayed swimming or twitching motility. Four isolates showed proteolytic activity and amplified stmPr1 and stmPr2 genes. Only the first three isolates were siderophore producers. Four isolates showed high resistance to oxidative stress, while the last four showed moderate resistance.Conclusion. The present study shows the long-time persistence of two related S. maltophilia clones in an adult female with CF. During the adaptation of the prevalent clones to the CF lungs over time, we identified a gradual loss of virulence factors that could be associated with the high amounts of DSF produced by the evolved isolates. Further, a decreased mutation rate was observed in the late isolates. The role of all these adaptations over time remains to be elucidated from a clinical perspective, probably focusing on the damage they can cause to CF lungs."

RESULTS: From July 2009 to June 2014, a total of 83 patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections were identified based on the databank of the bacteriology laboratories of two hospitals. The overall mean age was 53.3 years, and men comprised 53 (63.9%) of the patients. Liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus were the two most common underlying diseases, followed by malignancy. The most common type of infection was acute gastroenteritis (n = 45, 54.2%), followed by biliary tract infection (n = 12, 14.5%) and primary bacteremia (n = 11, 13.3%). Other types of infection, such as peritonitis (n = 5, 6.0%), skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) (n = 5, 6.0%), urinary tract infection (n = 3, 3.6%) and pneumonia (2, 2.4%), were rare. July and June were the most common months of occurrence of V. cholera infections. The overall in-hospital mortality of 83 patients with V. cholera infections was 7.2%, but it was significantly higher for patients with primary bacteremia, hemorrhage bullae, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, or admission to an ICU. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with acute respiratory failure (odds ratio, 60.47; 95% CI, 4.79-763.90, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Non-O1 V. cholera infections can cause protean disease, especially in patients with risk factors and during warm-weather months. The overall mortality of 83 patients with non-O1 V. cholera infections was only 7.2%; however, this value varied among different types of infection."

Children under 5 years comprised 74% of the patients. Diarrhoeal pathogens were identified as Shigella spp. in 27%, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 17%, Entamoeba histolytica in 16%, Campylobacter jejuni in 12%, Salmonella spp. in 4%, Vibrio cholerae in 4%, and Giardia lambliain 4% of cases. The most frequent underlying causes of death were colitis in 44% and pneumonia in 38%. The most frequent immediate causes of death were septicaemia in 27%, hypoglycaemia in 9%, and hypokalaemia in 9%; multiple causes of death were present in 89% of cases. Kwashiorkor or marasmus was present in 59% and fatty degeneration of the liver was detected in 61% of cases. It is concluded that, in susceptible children, diarrhoeal pathogens produce destructive inflammation in the intestine and cause death or contribute to it by provoking disease in other tissues, especially septicaemia and fatty liver, or by combining these effects with antecedent or concomitant conditions, especially pneumonia and malnutrition."

The index case had severe diarrhea and metabolic acidosis and died from pneumonia on the ninth day of illness; the other five cases had only mild to moderate diarrhea. Fish caught in Agana Bay and home-preserved was found to be the vehicle most likely responsible for the cases. Vibrio cholerae, El Tor Ogawa, was isolated from two patients, the Guam sewerage system, and a river emptying into Agana Bay. V. cholerae, El Tor Inaba, was isolated from the sewerage system, three storm drains imptying into Agana Bay, and Agana Bay. The Ogawa and Inaba isolates differed in their sucrose fermentation and hemolysis reactions, phage type and ability to produce toxin. Although this was the first reported cholera outbreak on Guam, the isolation of differentV. cholerae strains suggested that multiple introductions of V. cholerae had occurred on the island."

Plague is still encountered in humans in the areas of its enzootic prevalence in local rodent populations. Infection by flea bite results in a bubonic or septicemic plague, possibly complicated by secondary pneumonia. The person with pneumonic symptoms may be a source of a droplet-borne inhalatory infection for other people who consequently develop primary pneumonic plague. Despite a clinical form, plague is a severe infection characterized by a short incubation period, rapid onset and quick progress with mortality exceeding 50% if not treated properly. The pneumonic plague is associated with a particularly rapid progress and the mortality rate of almost 100% if not treated properly. As Yersinia pestis can be easily obtained and cultured and is highly pathogenic for humans, it poses a serious threat of being used for bioterrorism purposes. Artificially created aerosol containing plague bacilli can cause numerous and almost simultaneous cases of primary pulmonic plague in an exposed population. Persons exposed would most likely develop severe pneumonia with rapidly progressing respiratory and circulatory failure. The use of the Yersinia pestis strains resistant to antibiotics typically applied cannot be excluded."

However, the role of specific plasmid-encoded vs. chromosomal Y. pestis virulence factors in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, shock, and nonpulmonary dysfunction is unclear. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of pneumonic plague resulting from expression of proteins encoded by the thermally regulated pCD1 plasmid differs from cardiopulmonary and inflammatory changes attributable to the chromosomal pgm gene locus. DESIGN: Prospective, experimental study. SETTING: Research laboratory at a university medical center. SUBJECTS: Conscious, chronically catheterized male Sprague-Dawley rats (total n=104). INTERVENTIONS: Rats were intratracheally infected with 109 colony-forming units of Y. pestis attenuated strains CO99 (pCD1+/DeltaApgm) or KIM6+ (pCD1-/pgm+) and evaluated over 6 days. Serial evaluations of vital signs, cardiorespiratory parameters, blood cultures, inflammatory biomarkers, and organ function were obtained, as well as organ histopathology and cytokine production. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Despite equivalent endotoxin contents between the inocula, CO99-infected animals had a median survival of 3 days with greater nonpulmonary organ injury, microbial growth, serum alanine aminotransferase, and liver microvascular permeability vs. KIM6+-infected animals (p&lt;.05). Parallel differences occurred in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. Notably, 75% of CO99 rats developed fatal hypotension after developing nonpulmonary organ damage. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that progression to lethal sepsis with augmented liver injury during plague pneumonia requires factors encoded by the pCD1 plasmid but not chromosomal proteins present within the pgm gene locus."

The causative agents of these outbreaks have been confirmed using modern molecular tests. The vector of plague during pandemics remains the subject of controversy. Nowadays, plague must be suspected in all areas where plague is endemic in rodents when patients present with adenitis or with pneumonia with a bloody expectorate. Diagnosis is more difficult in the situation of the reemergence of plague, as in Algeria for example, told by the first physician involved in that outbreak (NM). When in doubt, it is preferable to prescribe treatment with doxycycline while waiting for the test results because of the risk of fatality in individuals with plague. The typical bubo is a type of adenitis that is painful, red and nonfluctuating. The diagnosis is simple when microbiological analysis is conducted. Plague is a likely diagnosis when one sees gram-negative bacilli in lymph node aspirate or biopsy samples. Yersinia pestis grows very easily in blood cultures and is easy to identify by biochemical tests and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Pneumonic plague and septicemic plague without adenitis are difficult to diagnose, and these diagnoses are often made by chance or retrospectively when cases are not part of an epidemic or related to another specific epidemiologic context. The treatment of plague must be based on gentamicin or doxycycline. Treatment with one of these antibiotics must be started as soon as plague is suspected. Analysis of past plague epidemics by using modern laboratory tools illustrated the value of epidemic buboes for the clinical diagnosis of plague; and brought new concepts regarding its transmission by human ectoparasites."

The organism had been previously misidentified as Pseudomonas luteola by an automated system in the hospital laboratory. An investigation led by Tri-County Health Department (TCHD) revealed that patient A's dog had died recently with hemoptysis. Three other persons who had contact with the dog, one of whom also had contact with patient A, were ill with fever and respiratory symptoms, including two with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Specimens from the dog and all three human contacts yielded evidence of acute Y. pestis infection. One of the pneumonia cases might have resulted through human-to-human transmission from patient A, which would be the first such event reported in the United States since 1924. This outbreak highlights 1) the need to consider plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs, in areas where plague is endemic; 2) the limitations of automated diagnostic systems for identifying rare bacteria such as Y. pestis; and 3) the potential for milder plague illness in patients taking antimicrobial agents.

Madagascar is the leading country for human plague cases worldwide. Human plague is a serious disease, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms. We report a case of pneumonic plague co-infected by a MDR-Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24 year-old man originated from Soavinandriana, a plague focus, felt uneasy and developed high fever with chills. He started treatment by himself, by private medical care and by a traditional healer for nine days moving several times from place to place. His condition had deteriorated when he presented to a district hospital with a syndrome of dyspnea, bronchial rale and altered state of consciousness. Two days later, plague diagnosis, performed as a last resort, revealed a positive F1 antigen on rapid diagnostic test. Additional tests (pla PCR and plague serology) evidenced a Y. pestis infection. However, streptomycin treatment did not achieve a complete recovery as the course of disease was complicated by the presence of MDR-S. maltophilia in his lung. This opportunistic infection could have been favored by an immunosuppression due to Y. pestis pulmonary infection and probably been acquired during his stay at a District Hospital. He was treated with a combination of ciprofloxacin and gentamycin and recovered fully. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonic plague infection may promote another virulent or avirulent bacterial infection particularly when it is not initially suspected. However, coinfection is rarely described and its occurrence frequency is unknown. In middle or low resources areas, which is the case of most plague endemic countries, control and prevention of infections in health facilities is not optimal. Co-infection with an opportunistic pathogen agent, such as S. maltophilia, is a risk which must not be disregarded as demonstrated by this case report. When deciding of a national control strategy, it should be taken into account in the choice of the first line treatment."

Plague may manifest in one of three clinical forms; bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic. Bubonic and septicemic plague represent relatively little risk for human-to-human transmission to contacts, although heavily infected secretions, such as drainage from a bubo, pose a theoretical risk, especially if they are aerosolized from a syringe during diagnohree clinical forms; bubonic, septicemic, or penumonic. Bubonic and septicemic plague represent relatively little risk for human-to-human transmission to contacts, although heavily infected secretions, such as drainage from a bubo, pose a theoretical risk, especially if they are aerosolized from a syringe during diagnohree clinical forms; bubonic, septicemic, or penumonic. Bubonic and septicemic plague represent relatively little risk for human-to-human transmission to contacts, although heavily infected secretions, such as drainage from a bubo, pose a theoretical risk, especially if they are aerosolized from a syringe during diagnostic aspirations. Pneumonic plague may be highly contagious to contacts and poses a greater risk. The Plague Branch, Center for Disease Control recommends that all patients with plague be placed in strict isolation for the first 48 hours of treatment because of the possibility that pneumonia may supervene. If it does not, wound and skin precautions are adequate for the duration of hospitalization. Untreated plague pneumonia is an epidemiologic emergency. All contacts must be identified promptly and those with face-to-face exposure should receive abortive antibiotic therapy. All contacts should be under surveillance, with twice-daily temperature checks, for seven days."

Animal reservoirs include rodents, rabbits, and occasionally larger animals. Cats become ill and have spread pneumonic disease to man. Dogs may be a significant sentinel animal as well as a reservoir, although do not usually become ill. Flea bites commonly spread disease to man. Person to person spread has not been a recent feature until the purported outbreak of plague and plague pneumonia in India in 1994. Other factors that increase risk of infection in endemic areas are occupation-veterinarians and assistants, pet ownership, direct animal-reservoir contact especially during the hunting season, living in households with an index case, and, mild winters, cool moist springs, and early summers. Clinical presentations include subclinical plague (positive serology without disease); plague pharyngitis; pestis minor (abortive bubonic plague); bubonic plague; septicemic plague; pneumonic plague; and plague meningitis. Most prominent of plague's differential diagnosis are Reye's syndrome, other causes of lymphadenitis, bacterial pneumonias, tularemia, and acute surgical abdomen. Treatment has reduced mortality from 40-90% to 5-18%. The drug of choice (except for plague meningitis) is streptomycin, with tetracyclines being alternatives. Parenteral cholamphenicol is the treatment of choice for plague meningitis. A tetracycline should be administered as chemoprophylaxis to all contacts over the age of 8 years. Plague vaccine is available, but is only partially protective."

","SPECIES:Yersinia pseudotuberculosisID:18460627TITLE:Fatal yersiniosis in farmed deer caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype O:3 encoding a mannosyltransferase-like protein WbyK.ABSTRACT:Sudden death of 9 deer occurred in a large enclosed deer farm with approximately 400 heads of cervids. Fatal yersiniosis was diagnosed in 2 deer that were submitted for laboratory diagnosis. Histopathologically, the disease was characterized by multifocal pulmonary hemorrhage and mild interstitial pneumonia, marked diffuse cholangiohepatitis, minimal myocarditis with mild myocardial degeneration, and mild multifocal suppurative cystic colitis. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was isolated from the lungs and colon of the affected animals. The isolates were PCR-positive for genes virF, inv, yopB, and yopH, which are essential for invasion and colonization of host intestine and lung. The isolates reacted with polyclonal antibodies against serotype O:3 antigen. The O-genotyping patterns of the isolates were identical with each other, but different from those of the 21 O-genotypes (or serotypes) reported previously. In addition to the O-antigen genes possessed by classical serotype O:3, a gene (wbyK) encoding a mannosyltransferase-like protein was detected in these isolates. The wbyK gene of the isolates showed 94% of DNA sequence homology with the wbyK gene harbored by Y. pseudotuberculosis O:1b. On the basis of pathology, bacteriology, and serology, the authors concluded that the acute deaths of these deer were caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. Molecular characterization of the isolate revealed a genetic heterogeneity in the O-antigen gene cluster of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype O:3."

","SPECIES:Yersinia pseudotuberculosisID:9097371TITLE:Plague pneumonia disease caused by Yersinia pestis.ABSTRACT:Plague is a zoonotic infection caused by Yersina pesits, a pleomorphic, gram-negative non-spore-forming coccobacillus that is more accurately classified as a subspecies of Y pseudotuberculosis. Animal reservoirs include rodents, rabbits, and occasionally larger animals. Cats become ill and have spread pneumonic disease to man. Dogs may be a significant sentinel animal as well as a reservoir, although do not usually become ill. Flea bites commonly spread disease to man. Person to person spread has not been a recent feature until the purported outbreak of plague and plague pneumonia in India in 1994. Other factors that increase risk of infection in endemic areas are occupation-veterinarians and assistants, pet ownership, direct animal-reservoir contact especially during the hunting season, living in households with an index case, and, mild winters, cool moist springs, and early summers. Clinical presentations include subclinical plague (positive serology without disease); plague pharyngitis; pestis minor (abortive bubonic plague); bubonic plague; septicemic plague; pneumonic plague; and plague meningitis. Most prominent of plague's differential diagnosis are Reye's syndrome, other causes of lymphadenitis, bacterial pneumonias, tularemia, and acute surgical abdomen.

Three dead foals were examined. The manifestations of watery diarrhoea and pneumonia were observed. A profuse growth of an enterotoxigenic strain of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was obtained from the internal organs of the foals. The foals with clinical symptoms of pneumonia and watery diarrhoea were immunized with Propionibacterium acnes t. II. All mares and their offspring from the stud were treated with an immunomodulator (Propionibacterium acnes t. II) and then vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated culture of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis."
