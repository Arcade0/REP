","SPECIES:Aerococcus viridansID:31366344TITLE:Neonatal meningitis, endocarditis, and pneumonitis due to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus: a case report.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pasteurianus is a rare cause of neonatal infection, with only 3 cases reported in the USA and 18 cases reported in other countries within the past decade. Neonatal S. pasteurianus infection typically presents as meningitis. This case report describes the first neonatal case of S. pasteurianus endocarditis in the literature, in addition to a neonatal case of S. pasteurianus infection presenting as pneumonitis without meningitis. The S. pasteurianus infections in these two cases are unusual not only because of how rare this particular pathogen is, but also because of the atypical clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient is a full-term male infant admitted to NICU at 20 h of life due to respiratory distress. He was empirically started on ampicillin and gentamicin for presumed sepsis. Laboratory analysis of cerebral spinal fluid obtained after initiation of antibiotics was suggestive of partially treated meningitis. Blood cultures came back positive for S. pasteurianus. The neonate was transitioned from ampicillin to cefepime, while gentamicin was continued. Echocardiograph showed a possible tricuspid valve vegetation concerning for endocarditis. Due to the unusual complication of endocarditis, the patient remained on IV cefepime for 28 days rather than the more conventional duration of 14-21 days reported in the literature. The baby clinically improved with no evidence of thrombi or vegetations on repeat cardiac echo. The second patient is a full-term male infant who required intubation at birth for respiratory distress. Chest X-ray findings were concerning for meconium aspiration with pneumonitis. The baby went into septic shock and was empirically started on ampicillin and gentamicin. Blood cultures came back positive for S. pasteurianus, while cerebral spinal fluid and urine cultures were negative. Ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued after 3 days and the baby was started on cefepime and clindamycin for a total 14-day course. The baby clinically recovered and was discharged from NICU without any sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases highlight the importance of recognizing S. pasteurianus as a potential cause of neonatal sepsis and the importance of recognizing endocarditis and pneumonitis as possible clinical manifestations of this infection."

This retrospective surveillance aimed to analyze serotype distribution, drug resistance, virulence factors, and molecular characteristics of pneumonia isolates from children in Shanghai, China. Methods: A total of 287 clinical pneumococcal isolates were collected from January to December in 2018 and were divided into community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) two groups according to where someone contracts the infection. All isolates were serotyped by multiplex sequential PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using E-test or disk diffusion method. The molecular epidemiology was analyzed using multilocus sequence typing and seven housekeeping genes were sequenced to identified the sequence types (STs). In addition, we investigated the presence of virulence genes via PCR. Results: The most common serotypes were 19F, 6A, 19A, 23F, 14, and 6B, and the coverage rates of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were 58.9, 58.9, and 80.5%, respectively. More PCV13/non-PCV7 serotypes and higher rate of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae were seen in HAP. Molecular epidemiological typing showed a high level of diversity and five international antibiotic-resistant clones were found, including Taiwan19F-14, Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Taiwan23F-15 and Sweden15A-25. No significant difference was observed in the presence of virulence genes among the isolates obtained from CAP and HAP. All of the S. pneumoniae isolates carried lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP, and the carriage rate of nanA and piaA were 96.2 and 99.0%. Conversely, cps2A, cbpA, and pspA were present in 33.8-44.3% of the isolates. Conclusions: Serotype changes and emerging multidrug-resistant international clones were found in current study. lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP may be good protein vaccine candidates. Long-term high-quality surveillance should be conducted to assess impact and effectiveness brought by vaccines, and provide a foundation for prevention strategies and vaccine policies."

Zimbabwe introduced 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2012 using a 3-dose infant schedule with no booster dose or catch-up campaign. We evaluated the impact of PCV13 on pediatric pneumonia and meningitis. METHODS: We examined annual changes in the proportion of hospitalizations due to pneumonia and meningitis among children aged &lt;5 years at Harare Central Hospital (HCH) pre-PCV13 (January 2010-June 2012) and post-PCV13 (July 2013-December 2016) using a negative binomial regression model, adjusting for seasonality. We also evaluated post-PCV13 changes in serotype distribution among children with confirmed pneumococcal meningitis at HCH and acute respiratory infection (ARI) trends using Ministry of Health outpatient data. RESULTS: Pneumonia hospitalizations among children aged &lt;5 years steadily declined pre-PCV13; no significant change in annual decline was observed post-PCV13. Post-PCV13 introduction, meningitis hospitalization decreased 30% annually (95% confidence interval [CI], -42, -14) among children aged 12-59 months, and no change was observed among children aged 0-11 months. Pneumococcal meningitis caused by PCV13 serotypes decreased from 100% in 2011 to 50% in 2016. Annual severe and moderate outpatient ARI decreased by 30% (95% CI, -33, -26) and 7% (95% CI, -11, -2), respectively, post-PCV13 introduction. CONCLUSIONS: We observed declines in pediatric meningitis hospitalizations, PCV13-type pneumococcal meningitis, and severe and moderate ARI outpatient visits post-PCV13 introduction. Low specificity of discharge codes, changes in referral patterns, and improvements in human immunodeficiency virus care may have contributed to the lack of additional declines in pneumonia hospitalizations post-PCV13 introduction."

However information regarding the contribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae to pneumonia causation in Mongolia is limited. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of hospitalized children aged 2-59 months with pneumonia, enrolled into a surveillance program in the period prior to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction, in Mongolia. METHODS: An expanded pneumonia surveillance program enrolled children, who met the surveillance case definition, at participating hospitals, between April 2015 and May 2016. Cumulative incidence rates were calculated by district for all pneumonia endpoints using district specific denominators from the Mongolian Health Department census for 2016. Socio-economic and disease-associated factors were compared between districts using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: A total of 4318 eligible children with pneumonia were enrolled over the 14 month period. Overall the incidence for all-cause pneumonia in children aged 12-59 months was 31.8 per 1000 population; children aged 2-11 months had an almost four-fold higher incidence than children aged 12-59 months. Differences were found between districts with regards to housing type, fuel used for cooking, hospital admission practices and the proportions of severe and primary endpoint pneumonia. DISCUSSION: This study shows a high burden of pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months in Mongolia prior to PCV introduction. Rates differed somewhat by district and age group and were influenced by a number of socio-economic factors. It will be important to consider these differences and risk factors when assessing the impact of PCV introduction."

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Pneumococcal vaccination guidelines from the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization in 2013 and 2016 constitute level III evidence for CAP prevention in the Canadian adult population. MAIN MESSAGE: It is recommended that immunosuppressed adults of all ages receive the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (grades A and B recommendations). In 2016, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization also recommended that all adults aged 65 years and older receive PCV13 (grade A recommendation) on an individual basis, followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (grade B recommendation). This update is based on a large clinical study that demonstrated PCV13 efficacy against vaccine-type CAP in this population. CONCLUSION: Physicians should focus on improving pneumococcal vaccination rates among adults, which remain low. Vaccination with PCV13 should also be considered for adults with chronic conditions, whose baseline risk is often higher than that for healthy individuals aged 65 years and older."

This epidemiological finding has generated debate regarding the effectiveness of PCV13 against serotype 3 disease. Evaluating PCV13 effectiveness against serotype 3 is especially critical in adults, where serotype 3 makes up an important amount of remaining pneumococcal disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the published literature to assess the direct effectiveness of PCV13 against serotype 3 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among adults. We then estimated overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a pooled analysis of the individual-level, raw data. RESULTS: Two published studies met inclusion criteria. One was a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2014. The other was a recently-published case-control study conducted in Louisville, Kentucky that used a test-negative design (TND). We also identified a third TND study conducted in Argentina that was recently presented as a conference abstract but is not yet published. All three studies were conducted in adults aged &gt;=65 years. PCV13 VE against serotype 3 hospitalized CAP was 52.5% (95%CI: 6.2-75.9%) from the pooled analysis of individual-level data from all three studies. Results were similar if the unpublished estimate was excluded (serotype 3 VE = 53.6% [95%CI: 6.7-76.9%]). No heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Currently-available evidence, although limited to three studies, suggests that PCV13 provides direct protection against serotype 3 hospitalized CAP in adults aged &gt;=65 years."

The objective was to describe S. pneumoniae serotypes in children with or without pneumonia. METHODS: It was a case-control study carried out in 8 developing and emerging countries between 2010 and 2014. Cases were children aged &lt;5 years admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. Controls were children admitted for surgery or routine outpatient care. RESULTS: In nasopharyngeal samples, S. pneumoniae were detected in 68.2% of the cases and 47.5% of the controls (P &lt; .001). Nasopharyngeal carriage was associated with a higher risk of being a case in 6/8 study sites (adjusted odds ratio ranged from 0.71 [95% confidence interval [CI], .39-1.29; P = .26] in India [Pune/Vadu] to 11.86 [95% CI, 5.77-24.41; P &lt; .001] in Mongolia). The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes were more frequently detected in cases with nasopharyngeal carriage (67.1%) than in controls with nasopharyngeal carriage (54.6%), P &lt; .001. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in blood by polymerase chain reaction in 8.3% of the cases. Of 34 cases with an S. pneumoniae serotype detected in blood, 27 (79%) had the same serotype in the nasopharyngeal sample. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the assumption that the isolate carrying or causing disease in an individual is of the same serotype. Most serotypes independently associated with nasopharyngeal carriage or pneumonia are covered by PCV13, suggesting that increased PCV coverage would reduce the burden of S. pneumoniae-related pneumonia."

We examined whether community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP) in children carrying commonly recognized pneumonia invasive pneumococcal serotypes ([PnIST] 1, 5, 7F, 14, and 19A) differs from CAAP in children carrying less invasive serotypes (non-PnIST) or no Pnc (Pnc-neg). METHODS: Children <5 years, visiting the only regional Pediatric Emergency Room, with radiologically proven CAAP were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal cultures were processed for pneumococcal isolation and serotyping. Clinical and demographic characteristics were recorded. The study was conducted before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine implementation in Israel. RESULTS: A total of 1423 CAAP episodes were recorded: PnIST, 300 (21.1%); non-PnIST, 591 (41.5%); and Pnc-neg, 532 (37.4%). After adjustment for age, ethnicity, seasonality, and previous antibiotics, the following variables were positively associated with PnIST carriage compared with both groups: temperature >=39 C, peripheral white blood cell count >=20 000/mm3, C-reactive protein >=70.0 mg/L, and serum sodium <135 mEq/L. Lower oxygen saturation, viral detection, and comorbidities were negatively associated with Pn-IST carriage (odds ratios, <1.0). Differences between non-PnIST carriers and Pnc-neg groups were smaller or nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Young children with CAAP carrying common PnIST had a lower proportion of comorbidities, hypoxemia, and viral detection and had more intense systemic inflammatory response than those carrying non-PnIST or not carrying Pnc."

METHODS: We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study of adults admitted to two large university hospitals with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) between September 2013 and August 2018. Pneumococcal serotypes were identified using a novel 24-valent urinary monoclonal antibody assay and from blood cultures. Trends in incidence rates were compared against national invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) data. Persons at risk of vaccine-type pneumonia (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)13 and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV)23) were determined from multivariate analyses. FINDINGS: Of 2934 adults hospitalised with CAP, 1075 (36.6%) had pneumococcal pneumonia. The annual incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia increased from 32.2 to 48.2 per 100 000 population (2013-18), predominantly due to increases in PCV13non7-serotype and non-vaccine type (NVT)-serotype pneumonia (annual incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.21 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28, respectively). Incidence trends were broadly similar to IPD data. PCV13non7 (56.9% serotype 3) and PPV23non13 (44.1% serotype 8) serotypes were identified in 349 (32.5%) and 431 (40.1%) patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, respectively. PCV13-serotype pneumonia (dominated by serotype 3) was more likely in patients in the UK pneumococcal vaccination clinical risk group (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.28) while PPV23-serotype pneumonia was more likely in patients outside the clinical risk group (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.10). INTERPRETATION: The incidence of pneumococcal CAP is increasing, predominantly due to NVT serotypes and serotype 3. PPV23-serotype pneumonia is more likely in adults outside currently identified clinical risk groups."

The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the clinical syndromes, prognostic factors and outcomes for pneumococcal disease in adults and children in Singapore during the period before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine. We retrospectively analyzed a large cohort of patients admitted to the four main public hospitals in Singapore with S. pneumoniae infection between 1997 and 2013. A total of 889 (64% of all isolates identified in the clinical laboratories) cases were included in the analysis; 561 (63.1%) were adult (>=16 years) cases with a median age of 62 years and 328 (36.9%) were paediatric cases with a median age of 3 years. Bacteraemic pneumonia was the most common syndrome in both groups (69.3% vs. 44.2%), followed by primary bacteraemia without pneumonia (14.3% vs. 13.4%), meningitis (6.4% vs. 7.6%) and non-bacteraemic pneumonia (5.2% vs. 21%). The major serotypes in adults were 3, 4, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F whereas in children they were 14, 6B and 19F, accounting both for nearly half of pneumococcal disease cases. No particular serotype was associated with mortality or severity of the pneumococcal disease. Overall mortality rate was 18.5% in adults and 3% in children. Risk factors for mortality included acute cardiac events in adults, meningitis in children and critical illness and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in both adults and children. Penicillin resistance was not associated with increased mortality. Our results agree with global reports that the course of pneumococcal disease and its clinical outcome were more severe in adults than in children. The main serotypes causing invasive disease were mostly covered by the vaccines in use. The high mortality rates reflect an urgent need to increase vaccination coverage in both adults and children to tackle this vaccine-preventable infection."

Despite 34 countries introducing the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which reduces the risk of pneumococcal carriage (a prerequisite for disease) of some of the most pathogenic pneumococcal serotypes, it remains uncertain whether they will achieve the sustained direct or indirect protection necessary to reduce pneumococcal carriage to levels sufficient to interrupt transmission and disease. We will therefore summarise the available data on the impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in reducing vaccine serotype carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia in Africa between 2000 and 2019. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a predetermined search strategy, we will conduct a comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE database, the Excerpta Medica Database, the ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index), Scopus and the African Index Medicus to identify published studies reporting the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage (vaccine type and non-vaccine type), incidence rates of pneumococcal pneumonia and mortality among children, adults and HIV-infected (all-ages) pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and post-PCV introduction (published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2019) in African countries that have introduced PCVs (PCV7/PCV10/PCV13) in their routine national immunisation programme. The studies retained and data extracted will be assessed for bias using prevalidated tools and checklists. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed using the chi2 test on Cochrane Q statistic. A random effect meta-analysis will be used to estimate the overall prevalence of pneumococcal carriage and incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia across studies with similar characteristics. Results will be reported in compliance with the Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The protocol has been prepared in accordance to the 2015 guidelines on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review will not require ethical approval as we will be using already published data.

Universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has changed the epidemiology of IPD. In vaccinated children, IPD can be a marker of an underlying immunodeficiency. METHODS: This is a retrospective audit of children younger than 18 years with IPD admitted to 2 tertiary pediatric hospitals in Australia between 2011 and 2017. Data on predisposing conditions, immunologic evaluation, pneumococcal serotype, antibiotic susceptibility and treatment were collected. RESULTS: During the 7-year period, there were 131 presentations with IPD in 127 children; 3 children had recurrent IPD. Patients presented with sepsis (41%), empyema (29%), meningitis (18%), mastoiditis (12%), pneumonia (10%) and septic arthritis (4%). In 19 (15%) presentations, risk factors for IPD were present, including malignancy, hematologic disorder, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease and cochlear implant. Pneumococcal serotypes were determined in 78/131 (60%) of presentations: the most frequent serotypes were 19A (19%), 3 (13%), 7F (10%) and 19F (8%) and non-vaccine serotypes 22F (8%), 35B (6%), 15A (4%) and 38 (4%). Overall, 11% of isolates were non-susceptible to ceftriaxone. Only 36 patients (32%) had an immunologic evaluation, and 4 patients had proven or probable immunodeficiency. CONCLUSION: Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes 19A, 3, 19F and 7F remain frequent causes of IPD, non-vaccine serotypes are emerging. Our data support vancomycin treatment for children with pneumococcal meningitis given 11% of our isolates were not susceptible to ceftriaxone. It is important to consider underlying conditions predisposing to IPD in a population with high rates of pneumococcal vaccination."

The use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease while changing pneumococcal population through herd immunity and non-vaccine pneumococci replacement. This study investigated molecular epidemiologic characteristics of pneumococcal strains in the Kinki region of Japan from 2008 to 2013. A total of 159 invasive pneumococcal isolates were characterized by serotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR analysis of penicillin-binding protein genes, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In adult populations, pediatric PCV7 introduction decreased isolates expressing PCV7 serotypes via herd immunity and increased isolates expressing non-PCV7 serotypes. The rate of penicillin resistance and isolates with alterations in all three pbp genes was higher in PCV7 type isolates than in non-PCV7 type isolates. In MLST analysis, all of serotype 19F isolates were of the same sequence type, ST236, which is the antimicrobial-resistant clone Taiwan19F-14, and the majority of serotypes 23F and 19A isolates were of ST1437 and ST3111 respectively, which are the predominant clones of antimicrobial-resistant pneumococci in Japan. In PFGE profiles, serotype 6B-ST2224, serotype 19F-ST236, serotype 19A-ST3111, and serotype 23F-ST1437 formed six separate clusters composed of genetically identical strains, and genetically identical serotype 22F-ST433 formed two different clusters between the pre- and post-PCV7 period. The results of molecular analysis suggest the spread and persistence of these identical antimicrobial resistant clones in the Kinki region and genetic changes of epidemic clone serotype 22F-ST433 before and after pediatric PCV7 introduction."

METHODS: Between January and December 2017, children aged 2-59 months with chest radiography-confirmed CAP were enrolled. The parents were interviewed to collect information on the patients and home-based medication. Clinical information was derived from the patient files. Nasopharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected for isolation of the causative pathogens. Swab samples were analysed by quantitative PCR whereas blood samples were tested using BacT/Alert 3D. RESULTS: Overall, 109 children with CAP were included in this analysis. Provision of care to most children was delayed (median = 4.6 days). A quarter (26.6%) were given unprescribed/leftover antibiotics at home. Only one child had positive bacterial culture. Referrals were associated with nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (p = 0.003) and Haemophilus influenzae (p = 0.004). Of all admitted children, more than a quarter (n = 29) did not need to be hospitalised and inappropriately received injectable instead of oral antibiotics. CONCLUSION: We found high rates of home treatment, particularly with antibiotics. Appropriate health care was delayed for most children because of home treatment. Efforts are needed at the community level to improve awareness of antimicrobial resistance."

Available PCVs have less serotype coverage in India compared to western countries. Moreover, the baseline pneumococcal serotype and sequence type data is limited and available data doesn't represent the entire India. With this background we aimed to characterize invasive and carriage isolates of S. pneumoniae from a tertiary care hospital in South India. Materials and Methods: A total of 221 S. pneumoniae isolates, invasive (n=138) and carriage (n=83) between the time period of 2012-2018 were included. Isolates was identified and confirmed using standard laboratory protocols. Serotyping was performed by Customized sequential multiplex PCR and MLST as described in www.pubmlst.org. Results: The major serotypes were 19F, 6B, 14, 6A and 19A and the sequence types (ST) were ST63, 236 and 230. Predominant STs in invasive was ST 63 whereas in carriage were ST4894 and 1701. High level ST diversity in carriage was observed. Majority of the STs were SLVs or DLVs of previously reported STs or PMEN clones. Phylogenetic analyses of the STs revealed gradual expansion of three PMEN CCs CC320, 63 and 230. Conclusion: The vaccine serotypes were the predominant ones found to be associated with IPD, PMEN clones, new STs and antimicrobial resistance. Accordingly, PCV13 is expected to provide invasive serotype coverage of 75% in Indian children less than 5 years. This study provides baseline serotype and sequence type data prior to the introduction of PCV in South India."

Postoperatively, he required mechanical circulatory support with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and an intra-aortic balloon pump. Several days after surgery, new mitral and aortic paraprosthetic leaks (PPLs) developed. These were managed conservatively, initially, but eventually required percutaneous closure 6 weeks after the initial operation. This has enabled the patient to recover to independent mobility, 20 weeks after the operation. This case illustrates a rare clinical syndrome and the devastating impact of IE. Moreover, it illustrates the successful application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in postcardiotomy cardiac failure and the successful treatment of PPL in a patient unfit for redo surgery."

The pathogens of the disease may change for the misuse of antibiotics and the application of vaccines. Therefore, pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics may have changed. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics. METHOD: The current study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pathogens positive in children with S/L-PP under 14 years old at a single hospital between 1st Jan 2014 and 31st Dec 2018 retrospectively. The pathogens were detected by microbial cultivation, indirect immunofluorescence of the kit (PNEUMOSLIDE IgM), Elisa, and/or real-time PCR in the samples of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 593 children with S/L-PP received treatment at a single hospital during the study period by inclusion criteria. Four hundred fifty-one patients were single positive for one pathogen and 83 patients were positive for at least 2 pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) (72.34%) was the most commonly detected pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae) (8.77%). The prevalence of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time (p < 0.05). The positive rate of M.pneumoniae increased with ages of patients (p < 0.05). M.pneumoniae was statistically associated with the extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was statistically associated with abnormal white blood cells (WBCs) and C reactive proteins (CRPs) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M.pneumoniae was the most positive pathogen in children with S/L-PP. The positive rate of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time and the ages of children. M.pneumoniae was associated with extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was associated with abnormal WBCs and CRPs."

Aim of this study was analysis of patients residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and developing pneumonia to reach a better knowledge of criteria for hospitalization and outcomes. MATERIALS/METHODS: this is a prospective, observational study in which patients residing in 3 LTCFs (metropolitan area of Rome, Italy) and developing pneumonia, hospitalized or treated in LTCF, were recruited and followed up from January 2017 to June 2019. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, secondary endpoint was analysis of risk factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: Overall, 146 episodes of NHAP were enrolled in the study: 57 patients were treated in LTCF, while 89 patients were hospitalized. Overall incidence rates of NHAP varied from 2.6 to 7.5 per 1000 residents. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (25%), and in 28 (55%) patients was documented a MDR pathogen. For hospitalized patients was reported a higher 30-day mortality (43.8% Vs 7%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that severe pneumonia, neoplasm, chronic hepatitis, antibiotic monotherapy, and malnutrition were independent risk factors for hospitalization from LTCF. MDR pathogen, severe pneumonia, COPD, and moderate to severe renal disease were independently associated with death at 30 days. CONCLUSION: frail elderly patients in LTCF have a high risk of MDR etiology with a higher risk to receive an inadequate antibiotic therapy and a fatal outcome. These results point to the need for increased provision of acute care and strategies in LTCF."

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2 to 59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. RESULTS: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%). A third of patients with viral infections showed mixed infections. Case fatality rate was 3.2% (6/189). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infections predominated among this cohort of WHO-defined clinical pneumonia cases, whereas bacterial aetiologies were uncommon, highlighting the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached."

METHODS: The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health Project (PERCH), a multi-country case-control study, evaluated the etiology of hospitalized cases of severe and very severe pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months. The PERCH Thailand site enrolled children during January 2012-February 2014. We determined pneumococcal colonization prevalence and density, and serotype distribution of colonizing isolates. RESULTS: We enrolled 224 severe/very severe pneumonia cases and 659 community controls in Thailand. Compared to controls, cases had lower colonization prevalence (54.5% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.12) and lower median colonization density (42.1 vs. 210.2 x 103 copies/mL, p <0.0001); 42% of cases had documented antibiotic pretreatment vs. 0.8% of controls. In no sub-group of assessed cases did pneumococcal colonization density exceed the median for controls, including cases with no prior antibiotics (63.9x103 copies/mL), with consolidation on chest x-ray (76.5x103 copies/mL) or with pneumococcus detected in whole blood by PCR (9.3x103 copies/mL). Serotype distribution was similar among cases and controls, and a high percentage of colonizing isolates from cases and controls were serotypes included in PCV10 (70.0% and 61.8%, respectively) and PCV13 (76.7% and 67.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal colonization is common among children aged <5 years in Thailand. However, colonization density was not higher among children with severe pneumonia compared to controls. These results can inform discussions about PCV introduction and provide baseline data to monitor PCV impact after introduction in Thailand."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We have analysed the data of the official reporting documentation provided by the State Institution ""Poltava Regional Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine"" and the chart of patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of influenza who were in inpatient treatment at the Poltava Regional Clinical Infectious Hospital (PRCIH) in 2016-2018 years. In more detail, we examined 95 patients with pneumonia, which complicated the course of the flu. There were 43 (45.26%) female patients, - 52 (54.74%) male patients, aged 18 to 80 years. RESULTS: Results: Studies have shown that despite a decrease in the incidence of influenza in recent years, the incidence of pneumonia, which complicated the course of the flu, remained consistently high (19.7% - 20.8%) with bacteriological isolation of S.pneumoniae (22.11%), S.aureus (13.68%), Haemophilus influenza (4.21%) and E.coli (3.16%). Severe course of pneumonia with bloody sputum, evident shortness of breath, bilateral lung damage, and need for oxygen support were significantly more frequently reported in patients with isolated S.pneumoniae and S.aureus. However, the severe course of the disease with the formation of abscesses in the lungs was observed only in the group S.aureus despite the relatively young age of such patients and significantly fewer risk factors for severe influenza and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The study showed a consistently high incidence of pneumonia, which complicated the flu and caused by S.pneumoniae, S.aureus, Haemophilus influenza and E.coli. Pneumonia caused by S.pneumoniae and S.aureus, were characterizedthe most severe course; however, a severe course with the formation of abscesses in the lung tissue was observed only in the group of S.aureus."

Its colonization is thought to be the first step in the development of invasive pneumococcal diseases. This study aimed to investigate pneumococcal colonization patterns in early childhood. A longitudinal birth cohort study was conducted for investigating nasopharyngeal colonized pneumococci at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age, particularly focusing on the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) effect on nasopharyngeal colonization was also assessed. During 2013-2017, 855 infants were enrolled and a total of 107 isolates were recovered from 95 infants during the first three years of life. In this period, the prevalence of pneumococcal colonization increased, with values ranging from 0.2% (2/834) at 1 month of age to 5.9% (19/323) at 36 months of age. The investigation of serotype revealed that 81.1% (73/90) belonged to the non-PCV13 serotypes-23A, 15A, 15C, and 15B. Moreover, PCV13 serotypes significantly decreased during 2014-2015, when routine PCV13 vaccination was initiated in Taiwan. PCV13 introduction may lead to the reduction in the rates of pneumococcal isolates resistant (R) to penicillin. Under conditional PCV13 vaccination, pneumococcal isolates primarily belonged to non-PCV13 serotypes. This non-PCV13 serotype replacement exhibited lower rates of penicillin R isolates, suggesting that PCV13 administration may reduce the antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal disease burden and antibiotic use."

The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of etiological agents and their relationship with clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in this cohort of patients with CABM. METHODS: Our retrospective chart review analyzed the causative microorganisms, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes of 159 adults with CABM hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Centre of Vilnius University Hospital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. A Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score <= 3 was defined as unfavorable outcome. Predictors of an unfavorable outcome were identified through logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median patient age was 36 (IQR 24-56), and 51.6% were male. Microbiologically confirmed causative agents were identified in 80 (50.3%) patients: N. meningitidis in 55 (34.6%) patients with serotype B accounting for 85% of cases, S. pneumoniae in 15 (9.4%), L. monocytogenes in 5 (3.1%) and other in 5 (3.1%). The clinical triad of fever, neck stiffness and a change in mental status was present in 59.1% of patients. Coexisting conditions and comorbidities were similar in all groups stratified by etiology. Initial antimicrobial treatment consisted of penicillin in 78 patients (49.1%) and ceftriaxone in 72 patients (45.3%). The median time in which antibiotic treatment was started was 40 min (IQR 30.0-90.0). The outcome was unfavorable in 15.7% of episodes and death occurred in 5.7% of cases and did not differ according to the causative agent. Risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were age > 65 years, coexisting pneumonia and a platelet count <150x10e9/l. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative agent of CABM was N. meningitidis, with serotype B clearly dominant. Causative agents did not influence the disease outcome. The strongest risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were older age, pneumonia and a low platelet count. Since the introduction of routine vaccination against meningococcus B for infants in Lithuania in 2018, the national vaccination policy may hopefully contribute to a decrease in the incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease in the Lithuanian population."

METHODS: Clinical information and chest CT data of 149 COVID-19 patients between January 9, 2020 and March 15, 2020 and 97 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia between January 23, 2011 and March 18, 2020 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively analyzed. In addition, CT features were comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: According to the chest CT images, the probability of lung segmental and lobar pneumonia in S. pneumoniae pneumonia was higher than that in COVID-19(P<0.001); the probabilities of ground-glass opacity (GGO), the ""crazy paving"" sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa in COVID-19 were higher than those in S. pneumoniae pneumonia(P = 0.005, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively); and the probabilities of consolidation lesions, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, and pleural effusion in S. pneumoniae pneumonia were higher than those in COVID-19 (P<0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.003, P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of GGO, the crazy paving sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa on chest CT were significantly higher in COVID-19 than S. pneumoniae pneumonia. The most important differential points on chest CT signs between COVID-19 and S. pneumoniae pneumonia were whether disease lesions were distributed in entire lung lobes and segments and whether the crazy paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidation lesions were found."

CASE PRESENTATION: We described a woman with poorly controlled diabetes and steroid-dependent asthma who presented in a deep coma. She was found to have Streptococcus intermedius bacteremia and pyogenic ventriculitis that originated from right middle lobe pneumonia. Also, multiple small parenchymal lesions were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging and increased protein concentration was noted in cerebral spinal fluid. Initially, her coma was thought to be due to diabetic ketoacidosis and septic encephalopathy. However, her lowered level of consciousness was disproportionate to either diabetic ketoacidosis or septic encephalopathy, and her clinical course was not as expected for these two conditions. Treatment with antibiotic, corticosteroid and antihelminthic drugs was administered resulting in improving consciousness. The Streptococcus intermedius pneumonia progressed to form a large cavity that needed an early surgical lobectomy and resulted in the unexpected diagnosis of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosus. CONCLUSIONS: In critical care, a lowered level of consciousness may have many etiologies, and critical care clinicians should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of all possible causes to enable prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Since S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP globally, it is important to distinguish between MC-CAP and CAP due to S. pneumoniae (SP-CAP) in clinical practice. However, no past study compared clinical characteristics of MC-CAP and SP-CAP by statistical analysis. We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of MC-CAP by comparing those of SP-CAP, as well as the utility of sputum Gram staining. METHODS: This retrospective study screened CAP patients aged over 20 years visiting or admitted to Okinawa Miyako Hospital between May 2013 and April 2018. Among these, we included patients whom either M. catarrhalis alone or S. pneumoniae alone was isolated from their sputum by bacterial cultures. RESULTS: We identified 134 MC-CAP and 130 SP-CAP patients. Although seasonality was not observed in SP-CAP, almost half of MC-CAP patients were admitted in the winter. Compared to those with SP-CAP, MC-CAP patients were older (p < 0.01) and more likely to have underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma and bronchiectasis (p < 0.01). Approximately half of asthmatic MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients had asthma attacks. Although winter is an influenza season in Japan, co-infection with influenza virus was less common in MC-CAP compared to SP-CAP patients (3% vs. 15%, p < 0.01). Bronchopneumonia patterns on X-ray, as well as bronchial wall thickening, bilateral distribution, and segmental pattern on CT were more common in MC-CAP patients than in SP-CAP patients (p < 0.01). Sputum Gram stain was highly useful method for the diagnosis in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP (78.4% vs. 89.2%), and penicillins were most frequently chosen as an initial treatment for both pneumonias. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that MC-CAP occurred in older people compared to SP-CAP, influenza virus co-infection was less common in MC-CAP than SP-CAP, and that MC-CAP frequently caused asthma attacks. Gram stain contributed for the appropriate treatment, resulting in conserving broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients."

A variety of infectious pathogens have been reported in children with pneumatoceles. We report the first case of adult pneumonia with pneumatocele formation that is likely caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and coinfection with influenza A virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Japanese man presented with a one-week history of fever, sore throat, and arthralgia. He was referred to our university hospital for respiratory distress. He required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Bacterial culture detected S. pyogenes in the bronchoscopic aspirates, which was not detected in blood. Although a rapid influenza antigen test was negative, an influenza A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive. Therefore, he was diagnosed with coinfection of influenza A and group A streptococcus (GAS) pneumonia complicated by probable streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. A chest radiograph on admission showed diffuse patchy opacification and consolidation in the bilateral lung fields. Multiple thin-walled cysts appeared in both middle lung fields on computed tomography (CT). On the following day, the bilateral cysts had turned into a mass-like opacity. The patient died despite intensive care. An autopsy was performed. The pathology investigation revealed multiple hematomas formed by bleeding in pneumatoceles. CONCLUSIONS: There have been no previous reports of a pneumatocele complicated by S. pyogenes in an adult patient coinfected with influenza A. Further molecular investigation revealed that the S. pyogenes isolate had the sequence type of emm3."

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of PNC and to identify the pneumococcal serotypes circulating among Bhutanese children under five years of age admitted with clinical pneumonia, before the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the country. We also aimed to contribute to the understanding of the interplay between PNC and viral co-infection among this population. METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted at the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital in Bhutan over 12 consecutive months. Children aged 2 to 59 months admitted with WHO-defined clinical pneumonia were eligible for recruitment. We collected blood for bacterial culture and molecular identification of S. pneumoniae, and nasopharyngeal washing for screening of respiratory viruses, and for the detection and capsular typing of S. pneumoniae by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Overall, 189 children were recruited, and PNC was tested in 121 of them (64.0%). PNC was found in 76/121 children (62.8%) and S. pneumoniae was identified in blood (both by culture and RT-PCR) in a single child. Respiratory viruses were detected in a similar proportion among children with (62/70; 88.6%) and without PNC (36/40; 90.0%; p = 1.000), but rhinovirus detection was less common among children with PNC (20/70; 28.6% versus 19/40; 47.5%; p = 0.046). Capsular typing identified 30 different serotypes. Thirty-nine children (51.3%) were colonised with two to five different serotypes. A third of the children presented with serotypes considered highly invasive. Over half of the children (44/76; 57.9%) were carrying at least one serotype included in PCV13. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides baseline information on the status of PNC among Bhutanese children admitted with clinical pneumonia prior to the introduction of PCV13, which is valuable to monitor its potential impact. PCV13 could theoretically have averted up to 58% of the pneumococcal infections among the children in this study, suggesting a future role for the vaccine to significantly reduce the burden associated with S. pneumoniae in Bhutan."

Although the study organisms had equal distributions among singly and multiply positive specimens (P = 0.90), A. otitis was detected significantly more often with one of the three other species (15 of 19, 78.9%) than the other species with each other (4 of 19, 21.1%, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a bacterial etiology for OME. Association of A. otitis with the three other species implies that this organism might have the capability of augmenting bacterial colonization in the middle ear."

S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen carried by children in all age groups, with the rate ranging from 15.8% in children aged 3-4 y to 28.6% in children aged 2-3 y. H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis showed similar carriage rates across all the age groups. Only 2 young children (0.5%) carried A. otitidis. Higher carriage of S. pneumoniae was found in children who had not received the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). Cefotaxime non-susceptibility was high (51.4%) in S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal isolates. Serotype 6B was the most common in fully immunized carriers and also in those who received catch-up immunization. Due to low PCV7 coverage in Taiwan, the carriage of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae in children remains common."

Alloiococcus otitidis is an outer ear commensal and putative middle ear pathogen that has not previously been described in acute otitis media (AOM) in this population. The aims of this study were to determine the presence, antibiotic susceptibility and bacterial load of A. otitidis in nasopharyngeal and ear discharge swabs collected from Indigenous Australian children with AOM with perforation. METHODS: Paired nasopharyngeal and ear discharge swabs from 27 children with AOM with perforation were tested by A. otitidis quantitative PCR (qPCR). Positive swabs were cultured for 21 days. Total and respiratory pathogen bacterial loads in A. otitidis-positive swabs were determined by qPCR. RESULTS: A. otitidis was detected by qPCR in 11 ear discharge swabs from 10 of 27 (37%) children, but was not detected in paired nasopharyngeal swabs. A. otitidis was cultured from 5 of 11 qPCR-positive swabs from four children. All A. otitidis isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations consistent with macrolide resistance. All A. otitidis qPCR-positive swabs were culture-positive for other bacteria. A. otitidis bacterial load ranged from 2.2 x 104-1.1 x 108 cells/swab (median 1.8 x 105 cells/swab). The relative abundance of A. otitidis ranged from 0.01% to 34% of the total bacterial load (median 0.7%). In 6 of 11 qPCR-positive swabs the A. otitidis relative abundance was &lt;1% and in 5 of 11 it was between 2% and 34%. The A. otitidis bacterial load and relative abundance measures were comparable to that of Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: A. otitidis can be a dominant species in the bacterial communities present in the ear discharge of Indigenous children with AOM with perforation. The absence of A. otitidis in nasopharyngeal swabs suggests the ear canal as the likely primary reservoir. The significance of A. otitidis at low relative abundance is unclear; however, at higher relative abundance it may be contributing to the associated inflammation. Further studies to better understand A. otitidis as a secondary otopathogen are warranted, particularly in populations at high-risk of progression to chronic suppurative otitis media and where macrolide therapies are being used."

The pathogenesis still remains unclear, though it is known that this complication is closely related to bacterial infections. Alloiococcus otitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from middle ear effusions (MEEs). OBJECTIVES: Due to the prevalence of OME in children, we decided to investigate bacterial agents that cause diseases such as A. otitidis, H. influenzae, S. pneumonia and M. catarrhalis in these subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five children between one and 15 years of age were selected for this study. Seventy specimens were collected from MEE by myringotomy and inoculated in PBS buffer. Conventional culture and PCR methods were used for identification of bacterial agents. RESULTS: The bacterial cultures in 8.6% of samples were positive by conventional culture, with A. otitidis, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae present in 1.4%, 2.9% and 4.3% of samples, respectively. No H. influenzae was isolated. By the PCR method, A. otitidis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, found in 25.7% of samples, followed by S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, which were identified in 20%, 12% and 20% of samples, respectively. Overall, 55 out of 70 samples were positive by both the PCR and culture method. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that A. otitidis was the major causative agent of MEE in children with OME. Therefore clinicians should be aware that bacterial infection plays an important role in the progression of acute otitis media to OME in children of our region."

Herein culture and PCR-sequencing-based investigations of corneal scraping specimens confirmed D. pigrum keratitis in three patients. CASE PRESENTATION: Three elderly patients presented with unilateral keratitis. None was a corneal-contact lens wearer, one had previous cataract surgery and another suffered rheumatoid arthritis sicca syndrome. Culturing the corneal scraping specimen was positive for two cases and PCR-sequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA in the presence of negative controls identified D. pigrum in three cases. The two D. pigrum isolates were in-vitro susceptible to penicillin G, amoxicillin, doxycycline, rifampicin and gentamicin. In all cases, surgical treatment of corneal thinning was necessary, but corneal perforation occurred in two cases despite intensive antimicrobial treatment with ticarcillin, gentamicin and vancomycin or levofloxacin eye drops leading to enucleation in one case.

METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate.

During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged &gt;or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged &gt;or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged &gt;or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality.

Patients recovering from lung transplantation (LT) are particularly susceptible owing to the physiologic stress imposed by surgery and induction with intense immunosuppression. Sites, types, and timing of GP infections following LT are not well documented. This report describes the clinical spectrum of GP infections and their effects on surgical airway complications (SAC) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) following LT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data were collected from 202 patients undergoing 208 LT procedures at a single institution between November 1990 and November 2005. Data were retrospectively analyzed according to timing, location, and causative pathogen. RESULTS: In the median follow-up period of 2.7 years (range, 0-13.6 years), 137 GP infections were confirmed in 72 patients. Sites of infection included respiratory tract (42%), blood (27%), skin, wound and catheter (21%), and other (10%). GP pathogens identified were Staphylococcus species (77%), Enterococcus species (12%), Streptococcus species (6%), Pneumococcus (4%), and Eubacterium lentum (1%). The likelihood of SAC and BOS was increased in lung allograft recipients with GP pneumonia as compared with those without (hazard ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval=1.5-3.1). CONCLUSIONS: GP organisms were responsible for infections in 40% of lung allograft recipients and most commonly isolated from the respiratory tract and blood stream. Staphylococcal species were most frequently identified, 42% of which were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Given the strong association of respiratory tract infections with the development of SAC and BOS, empiric antimicrobial strategies after LT should include agents directed against GP organisms, especially MRSA."

METHODS: Three different strategies of empirical antimicrobial prescription for VAP were consecutively implemented in an ICU: patient specific (10 months); scheduling, including sequential quarterly prioritization (12 months) and restriction (12 months) of antimicrobials; and mixing (10 months). Periods were compared, measuring the antimicrobial heterogeneity index (AHI). Incidence and resistance patterns of VAP caused by ESKAPE were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 127 microbiologic VAP episodes were documented. ESKAPE VAP increased significantly during scheduling (AHI, 0.65) compared with patient-specific (AHI, 0.88) and mixing (AHI, 0.87) periods (relative risk, 2.67 and 3.84, respectively). This finding was associated with a significant (P &lt; .05) increase of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii during the scheduling period (15.0%) compared with the patient-specific (2.4%) and mixing (0%) periods. ICU mortality of resistant patients with ESKAPE VAP was doubled that of patients without ESKAPE VAP (relative risk, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.67-9.48). Thirty-day mechanical ventilation-free days was significantly increased (5 days) in patients with resistant ESKAPE VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic strategies promoting diversity may prevent the emergence of resistance of ESKAPE organisms, improving use of health-care resources."

Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of data from LTACHs and from medical and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in short-stay acute care hospitals reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) during 2010. METHODS: Rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well as device utilization ratios were calculated. For each HAI, pathogen profiles and antimicrobial resistance prevalence were evaluated. Comparisons were made using Poisson regression and the mood median and chi2 tests. RESULTS: In 2010, 104 LTACHs reported CLABSIs and 57 reported CAUTIs and VAP to the NHSN. Median CLABSI rates in LTACHs (1.25 events per 1,000 device-days reported; range, 0.0-5.96) were comparable to rates in major teaching ICUs and were higher than those in other ICUs. CAUTI rates in LTACHs (median, 2.61; range, 0.0-9.92) were higher and VAP rates (median, 0.0; range, 0.0-3.29) were generally lower than those in ICUs. Central line utilization in LTACHs was higher than that in ICUs, whereas urinary catheter and ventilator utilization was lower. Methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus CLABSIs (83%) and vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecalis CAUTIs (44%) were higher in LTACHs than in ICUs. Multidrug resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa CAUTIs (25%) was higher in LTACHs than in most ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: CLABSIs and CAUTIs associated with multidrug-resistant organisms present a challenge in LTACHs. Continued HAI surveillance with pathogen-level data can guide prevention efforts in LTACHs."

Ochroconis gallopavum is a neurotropic dematiaceous mold responsible for life-threatening respiratory and central nervous system infections in domestic poultry and in immunologically compromised humans. The world literature describes only 13 previous O gallopavum infections in solid organ transplant recipients. We report herein an O gallopavum phaeohyphomycosis with involvement of skin in a transplant recipient. A 69-year-old white man with a history of bilateral lung transplantation 6 years ago presented with acute onset of severe respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia. Lung function showed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Excision biopsy was performed because of a suspected pigmented basal cell carcinoma. Histopathology revealed dermal granulomatous dermatitis, focally suppurative, dominated by epitheloid cells with brownish round fungi. Further microbiological work-up of the biopsy specimen subsequently revealed O gallopavum as the causative organism. No brain involvement was observed. Antimycotic therapy with voriconazole 200 mg twice a day was immediately initiated and the patient was treated for 3 months. Additional intravenous therapy with tobramycin and imipenem was started upon detection of Enterobacter clocae and Enterococci in the sputum. The patient recovered during the next few weeks and was discharged on day 26."

Her visual acuity was light perception (LP) in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Slit lamp examination showed corneal edema and hypopyon, and a view of the right fundus was impossible. Echography showed vitreous condensation. One day after presentation, the patient developed acute lung edema requiring hospitalization, so she was not submitted to vitreous tap and intravitreal treatment. The cardiac and systemic evaluations revealed a mitral endocarditis secondary to Enterococcus faecalis. The patient improved systemically with treatment with gentamicin, vancomycin, and linezolid. Her visual acuity remained as no LP, and her intraocular pressure (IOP) has been controlled with brimonidine bid despite developing a total cataract with 360  posterior synechia. A cardiac source for endogenous endophthalmitis should be considered in the presence of a prosthetic cardiac valve.

A total of 1,798 patients were hospitalized in our ICU for 13,942 days, of which 309 patients had DANIs, indicating an overall infection rate of 22.1 per 1,000 ICU-days. The central line-associated bloodstream infection rate was 6.4 per 1,000 catheter-days, whereas the ventilator-associated pneumonia rate was 14.3 per 1,000 ventilator-days and the catheter-associated urinary tract infection rate was 4.3 per 1,000 catheter-days. Overall, 87.4% of all Staphylococcus aureus DANIs were caused by methicillin-resistant strains. With respect to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 30.9% of the strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 23.3% to amikacin, 43.1% to ceftazidime, 19.1% to piperacillin-tazobactam, and 34.7% to imipenem. Furthermore, 1.9% of the Enterococcus spp. were resistant to vancomycin, and 51.1% of Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to ceftriaxone. DANI rates decreased over the 3-year study period, which was likely in response to the infection control measures implemented in our ICU. "

Infections were categorized as (1) underlying cause of death, (2) mechanism of death complicating another underlying cause of death, (3) contributing (4) agonal or (5) incidental. Of 608 autopsies (44% of deaths), 401 had 691 infections (66%, 1.72 infections/infected child). In categories 1-5, there were 85 (12.3%), 237(34.3%), 231 (33.4%), 82 (11.9%) and 56(8.1%) infections. Leading infections include bronchopneumonia (188), sepsis (144- Enterococcus most common with 22), meningitis (35- Streptococcus pneumoniae most common with 10), pneumonitis (33), peritonitis (29). Sepsis declined in 2002-2009, attributed to fluid resuscitation standardization. Meningitis declined after 1993, and may be partially attributed to vaccines (Hemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae).

Patients with malakoplakia often have an immunodeficiency state. It is believed that malakoplakia results from a defective macrophage response to phagocytosed bacteria. Malakoplakia most commonly affects the genitourinary tract. Cases confined to the liver are rare, with only five cases described in the literature. We report two cases of malakoplakia of liver; both were incidental autopsy findings. The first case involves a 53-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic refractory pancytopenia who presented with febrile neutropenia. His blood culture was positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterococcus faecium, and he subsequently developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The second case involves a 60-year-old man who presented with a mass in periorbital tissue which, on biopsy, showed inflammation and Treponema-like spirochetes. He died unexpectedly at home. Autopsy revealed adrenal gland chronic inflammation and abscess. Both cases had grossly normal livers with microscopic findings of calcified targetoid structures consistent with Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. In these cases, malakoplakia was an incidental finding confined to liver. Although asymptomatic in these cases, diagnosis in the liver may be useful to initiate a search for hepatic or non-hepatic infections. "

We assessed the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy, and outcomes of BSI in these patients. We also compared patients who died with those who survived to identify risk factors associated with mortality. From January 2006 to July 2012 all episodes of BSI in patients with solid tumors at a cancer center were prospectively recorded and analyzed. A total of 528 episodes of BSI were documented in 489 patients. The most frequent neoplasms were hepatobiliary tumors (19%), followed by lung cancer (18%) and lower gastrointestinal malignancies (16%). Many patients had received corticosteroid therapy (41%), and 15% had neutropenia (&lt;500 neutrophils/muL) at the time of BSI. The most common source of BSI was cholangitis (21%), followed by other abdominal (19.5%) and urinary tract infections (17%). Gram-negative BSI occurred in 55% of cases, mainly due to Escherichia coli (55%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16%). Among gram-positive BSI (35%), viridans group streptococci were the most frequent causative organisms (22%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (21%) and Enterococcus species (18%). We identified 61 multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms (13%), mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 20) and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 13). The majority of patients with BSI caused by MDR organisms had received antibiotics (70%), and they had been previously hospitalized (61.4%) more frequently than patients with BSI caused by susceptible strains. Inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy was given to 23% of patients, with a higher proportion in those with BSI due to a MDR strain (69%). Early (&lt;48 h) and overall (30 d) case-fatality rates were 7% and 32%, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate was higher among cases caused by MDR organisms (39.3%). The only independent risk factors for the early case-fatality rate were the endogenous source of BSI (odds ratio [OR], 3.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-12.02), shock at presentation (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.63-8.09), and corticosteroid therapy (OR, 3.245; 95% CI, 1.43-7.32). The independent risk factors for overall case-fatality rate were the presence of a chronic advanced cancer (OR, 35.39; 95% CI, 2.48-504.91), shock at presentation (OR, 25.84; 95% CI, 3.73-179.0), and corticosteroid therapy (OR, 6.98; 95% CI, 1.61-30.21).BSI in patients with solid tumors occurred mainly among those with hepatobiliary cancer, and cholangitis was the most frequent source; gram-negative bacilli were the most frequent causative agents. MDR organisms were relatively common, particularly in patients who had previously received antibiotics and had been hospitalized; these patients were frequently treated with inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy and had a poorer outcome. The case-fatality rate of patients with solid tumors and BSI was high and was associated with chronic advanced cancer, corticosteroid therapy, and shock at presentation."

Clinically significant infections in humans after a bite are often associated with the presence of immune deficiency. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient survival. In addition, patients with immune deficiency are susceptible to serious life-threatening nosocomial infections, which may also influence the prognosis of patients with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation after suffering two small bites from her dog. She had received a splenectomy during childhood. The patient survived after early empiric treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive care, including ventilation support, a high dose of noradrenalin, and continuous venovenous hemodialysis applied prior to the definitive diagnosis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. She improved within 2 weeks but, despite all efforts to prevent nosocomial infection, her hospital course was complicated by Enterococcus species and Candida albicans pleuropneumonia that prolonged her stay in the intensive care unit, and necessitated ventilation support for 2 months. CONCLUSION: Severe Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis may be complicated by life-threatening nosocomial infection in immunocompromized patients. The prophylactic application of antibiotics after a dog bite should be considered in high-risk individuals with immune deficiency in order to prevent both Capnocytophyga canimorsus sepsis and serious nosocomial complications."

However, the colonization characteristics of Enterococcus with LZD resistance in patients remain elusive. Here, we report the case of a patient with recurrent pneumonia due to infection with LZD-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strains. The colonization characteristics of the strains isolated from this patient were analyzed. METHODS: Ten E. faecalis strains were isolated from tracheal secretions obtained from the patient during five recurrences of pneumonia over the course of 10 months. Clonal relationships were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI-macrorestricted genomic DNA. The susceptibility of the isolates to LZD was determined by Etest in Mueller-Hinton agar. RESULTS: The homology of these strains was demonstrated by PFGE, suggesting that occult bacterial colonization by LZD-resistant E. faecalis is possible as late as a year after exposure to LZD. These strains showed variable MICs as determined by the Etest. LZD-resistant isolates contained single or double nucleotide mutations in domain V of 23S rRNA as confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sensitivity of the strains to vancomycin was demonstrated by broth macrodilution, and vancomycin was an effective clinical treatment on each occasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LZD-resistant E. faecalis strains may colonize persistently in vivo, leading to recurrent infection."

An in-depth understanding of their epidemiology is essential to reduce occurrence and to improve outcomes by targeted prevention strategies. The objectives of the study were to determine the epidemiology, source and concordance of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections with clinical site isolates. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study in critically ill adults admitted to a tertiary semi-closed intensive care unit in England to determine the epidemiology, source and concordance of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections with clinical site isolates. All nosocomial positive blood cultures over a 4-year study period were identified. Pathogens detected and concordances with clinical site are reported as proportions. RESULTS: Contaminant pathogens accounted for half of the isolates. The most common non-contaminant pathogens cultured were Pseudomonas spp. (8.0%), Enterococcus spp. (7.3%) and Escherichia coli (5.6%). Central venous catheter-linked bloodstream infections represent only 6.0% of the positive blood cultures. Excluding contaminants and central venous line infections, in only 39.5% of the bloodstream infections could a concordant clinical site source be identified, the respiratory and urinary tracts being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice should focus on a) improving blood culture techniques to reduce detection of contaminant pathogens and b) ensuring paired clinical site cultures are performed alongside all blood cultures to better understand the epidemiology and potential implications of primary and secondary discordant health-care associated bloodstream infections."

Clinical presentation is nonspecific. Pulmonary embolism may present initially similar to bacterial endocarditis of the right heart, septic thrombophlebitis, or osteomyelitis. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who had dyspnea over the four months before consultation, complicated three months later by hemoptysis. She was diagnosed with subacute bacterial endocarditis secondary to group D Streptococcus, developed upon a ventricular septal defect. Two weeks later, the child had sudden chest pain and tachypnea. Lung scintigraphy showed multiple pulmonary embolisms. The therapeutic approach was to continue antibiotics without anticoagulant treatment. The outcome was favorable with apyrexia and stabilization on the respiratory level. Pulmonary embolism is a rare disease in children with an incidence of 3.7%. Classically, it presents with fever, hemoptysis, and nonspecific infiltrates on chest X-ray. These signs were noted in our patient, although the infiltrates on the chest X-ray were hidden by the pulmonary edema associated with heart failure. The persistence of these left basal opacities after antidiuretic treatment suggested an infectious origin. Subsequently, lung scintigraphy showed that it was a pulmonary infarct. The therapy of septic pulmonary embolism is the same as that for infective endocarditis. Antibiotic treatment alone was maintained without anticoagulants because of the high risk of bleeding at the seat of the pulmonary embolism and the insubstantial significant benefit of this therapy. Pulmonary embolism in children is a rare disease, but its incidence is underestimated. Better knowledge on its actual impact and etiologies in children is necessary. Multicenter studies are needed to establish recommendations. "

We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of proven and probable cases of mucormycosis diagnosed between 2004-2012 to determine the epidemiology and outcome determinants in Australia. Seventy-four cases were identified (63 proven, 11 probable). The majority (54.1%) were caused by Rhizopus spp. Patients who sustained trauma were more likely to have non-Rhizopus infections relative to patients without trauma (OR 9.0, p 0.001, 95% CI 2.1-42.8). Haematological malignancy (48.6%), chemotherapy (42.9%), corticosteroids (52.7%), diabetes mellitus (27%) and trauma (22.9%) were the most common co-morbidities or risk factors. Rheumatological/autoimmune disorders occurred in nine (12.1%) instances. Eight (10.8%) cases had no underlying co-morbidity and were more likely to have associated trauma (7/8; 87.5% versus 10/66; 15.2%; p &lt;0.001). Disseminated infection was common (39.2%). Apophysomyces spp. and Saksenaea spp. caused infection in immuno-competent hosts, most frequently associated with trauma and affected sites other than lung and sinuses.

The median duration of developing infection post transplant was 270 days (range 2-2190). Most of the infections occurred after 6 months in 15/33 (45.5%). Urinary tract infection was the most common infection, noted in 13/33 (39.4%), followed by pneumonia, which was seen in 12 (33.3%), 9/12 (75%) of which were culture-positive. There were 2 cases (5.6%) of tuberculosis and 1 case (2.8%) of cytomegalovirus colitis. Out of the 9 culture-positive pneumonia cases, 6 (66.7%) were caused by gram-negative pathogens, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common isolate seen in 3/9 (33.3%) of the patients. Among those with urinary tract infection, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were isolated with equal proportion in 3/13 (23.1%), while Enterococcus faecalis was the most common isolate in 4/13 (30.8%). Overall infection-related mortality was 10/33 (30.3%), out of which 5/10 (50%) of deaths were from pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Post-transplant infection surveillance must be strengthened. The role of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in post-renal transplant infection in Nigeria needs to be evaluated."

One of these infections is those caused by Strongyloides stercoralis Immunocompromised patients are at risk of hyperinfection syndrome which is characterised with more systemic manifestation and a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. This can be complicated by coinfection with enteric organisms, specifically Gram-negative. Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci which are inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract. Even though enterococci can cause serious infections in multiple sites, they are a rare cause of pneumonia. We present a case of disseminated strongyloides with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus causing pneumonia. The patient had a complicated course with respiratory failure and septic shock. He died eventually due to his severe infections. After a literature review, we could not find a similar case of coinfection of disseminated strongyloides with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus pneumonia in immune-compromised patients."

Only a few studies are available from India addressing the microbiological aspects of VAP, which have been done with small study populations. This study was carried out in the intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital to assess the profile of pathogens and to determine the pattern of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of clinically suspected cases of VAP. Over a three year period, a total of 247 cases in 2011, 297 in 2012 and 303 in 2013 admitted in ICUs on mechanical ventilation with clinical evidence of VAP were included in our study. The endotracheal aspirate samples from these suspected cases were subjected to quantitative culture technique, and colony count of &gt;=10[5] colony forming units/ml was considered significant. Antimicrobial susceptibility test for the isolates was done. RESULTS: VAP rates of 44.1, 43.8 and 26.3 were seen in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In all the three years, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were the predominant organisms, followed by Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella spp. Staphylococcus aureus exhibited a downwards trend in prevalence from 50.0 per cent in 2011 to 34.9 per cent in 2013. An increase in vancomycin-resistant enterococci was seen from 4.3 per cent in 2012 to 8.3 per cent in 2013, while methicillin resistance amongst the S. aureus crossed the 50 per cent mark in 2013. An increasing trend in resistance was shown by Pseudomonas spp. for piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ), amikacin and imipenem (IPM). For the non-fermenters, resistance frequency remained very high except for IPM (33.1%) and polymyxin-B (2.4%). INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show VAP as an important problem in the ICU setting. The incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens was on the rise. The resistance pattern of these pathogens can help an institution to formulate effective antimicrobial policy. To have a comprehensive pan-India picture, multicentric studies are needed."

This study evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics and pathogenicity of P. agglomerans in children. We retrospectively reviewed microbiological test results for all children (1 month old to 18 years old) who were admitted to our pediatric hospital between January 2000 to June 2015 and had positive clinical specimen cultures for P. agglomerans. Isolates were identified using conventional tests and the BBL Crystal E/NF ID or MALDI-TOF MS systems. Antibiotic susceptibilities were evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. We identified fifteen positive cultures from 14 patients with confirmed infections. The positive specimens included pus, urine, tracheal aspirate, blood, and central venous line samples that yielded P. agglomerans. The median patient age was 8.8 years (range: 1.5 months to 16.5 years), and all patients had underlying comorbidities. Five patients had medical devices, and two devices were removed. The most common P. agglomerans infections involved wound infections (35.7%), pneumonia (21.4%), and urinary tract infections (21.4%). Three patients had concomitant infections (Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus). Five patients had anemia. Three patients (21.4%) died, and all three had carbapenem-resistant P. agglomerans that was detected after the first week of hospitalization; two cases involved pneumonia, which was ineffectively treated. P. agglomerans infections may be life-threatening, especially in young patients with pneumonia. Hospital-acquired P. agglomerans may have different pathogenicity and clinical features, compared to community-acquired P. agglomerans, although further studies are needed to understand the drug-resistance patterns in this bacterium."

We evaluated changes in hospital-acquired MRSA and VRE infections after discontinuing CPs for these organisms. METHODS: This is a retrospective study done at an 800-bed teaching hospital in urban Detroit. CPs for MRSA and VRE were discontinued hospital-wide in 2013. Data on MRSA and VRE catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), and hospital-acquired MRSA bacteremia (HA-MRSAB) rates were compared before and after CPs discontinuation. RESULTS: There were 36,907 and 40,439 patients hospitalized during the two 12-month periods: CPs and no CPs. Infection rates in the CPs and no-CPs periods were as follows: (1) MRSA infections: VAP, 0.13 versus 0.11 (P = .84); CLABSI, 0.11 versus 0.19 (P = .45); SSI, 0 versus 0.14 (P = .50); and CAUTI, 0.025 versus 0.033 (P = .84); (2) VRE infections: CAUTI, 0.27 versus 0.13 (P = .19) and CLABSI, 0.29 versus 0.3 (P = .94); and (3) HA-MRSAB rates: 0.14 versus 0.11 (P = .55), respectively.

INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent laparotomy surgery, during which a tumor was found in the splenic flexure of the descending colon. The tumor penetrated the colonic serosa and invaded the left side of the diaphragm. A left hemicolectomy was performed. OUTCOMES: After the operation, the patient recovered smoothly and was discharged on postoperative day 14. It's been over 3 years now, CT and colonoscopy assessments show no recurrence or metastasis. LESSONS: This case serves as a reminder to test for pathogens in patients with an unexplained empyema. If normal intestinal bacteria are detected, the empyema may be derived from intestinal disease. In addition, an abdominal examination should be performed in patients with an empyema of unknown origin."

In India, most of the surveillance of HAIs is reported from private sector hospitals that do not depict the situation of government sector hospitals. Other studies do not confirm with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance criterion, or deal with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) instead of ventilator-associated event (VAE). The aim of this study was to identify the incidences of 3 device-associated HAIs (DA-HAIs) (VAE, central line-associated bloodstream infection [CLABSI], and catheter-associated urinary tract infection [CAUTI]) by active surveillance using CDC's NHSN surveillance criteria and to identify the pathogens associated with these DA-HAIs. METHODS: This was a prospective surveillance study (January 2015-December 2016) conducted in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a large, tertiary care, government hospital situated in Delhi, India. Targeted surveillance was done as per the CDC's NHSN 2016 surveillance criteria. RESULTS: There were 343 patients admitted to the ICU that were included in the study. The surveillance data was reported over 3,755 patient days. A DA-HAIs attack rate of 20.1 per 100 admissions and incidence of 18.3 per 1,000 patient days was observed. The duration of use for each device for patients with DA-HAIs was significantly longer than for patients without DA-HAIs. The device utilization ratios of central line, ventilator, and urinary catheters were 0.57, 0.85, and 0.72, respectively. The crude excess length of stay for patients with DA-HAI was 13 days, and crude excess mortality rate was 11.8%. VAE, CLABSI, and CAUTI rates were 11.8, 7.4, and 9.7 per 1,000 device days, respectively. Among 69 DA-HAIs reported, pathogens could be identified for 49 DA-HAI cases. Klebsiella spp was the most common organism isolated, accounting 28.5% for all DA-HAI cases, followed by Enterococcus spp (24.4%). The most common organisms causing VAE, CAUTI, and CLABSI were Acinetobacter (6/15, 40%), Enterococcus spp (11/31, 35.4%), and Candida spp (5/19, 26.3%), respectively. Most of the gram-negative organisms were carbapenem resistant; however, none of the isolates were colistin resistant. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the risk of infection in hospitalized patients, DA-HAI surveillance is of primary importance because it effectively describes and addresses the importance and characteristics of the threatening situation created by DA-HAIs. The present surveillance shows high rates of ICU-onset DA-HAIs and high resistance patterns of organisms causing HAIs, representing a major risk to patient safety."

Methods: A retrospective study of a total of 106 microbiologically febrile episodes in hospitalized adult neutropenic cancer patients, who were admitted from May 2009 to May 2013, at King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Results: Among 106 microbiologically documented febrile neutropenic episodes, the majority of malignancies were solid tumors accounting for 53.8% (57/106) and hematological malignancies accounted for 46.23% (49/106). The most common malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 19.81% (21/106) followed by acute myeloid leukemia 15.09% (16/106), then colorectal cancer 13.21% (14/106), pancreatic cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 5.66% (6/106) each, multiple myeloma 4.72% (5/106), gall bladder cancer 3.77% (4/106), and lung cancer 2.83% (3/106). A total of 138 bacterial isolates were identified. The overall prevalence of gram-negative bacteria was 65.94% (91/138) and for gram-positive bacteria was 34.06% (47/138). The most common bacterial isolation sites were blood 33.32% (46 isolates), urine 29.71% (41 isolates), wound 19.55% (27 isolates), body fluids 9.41% (13 isolates) and sputum 7.96% (11 isolates). The most predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli 30.43 (42/138), Klebsiella pneumonia 14.49% (20/138), Staphylococcus aureus 13.04% (18/138), Sptreptococcus spp. 7.25% (10/138), Pseudomonas spp. 7.25% (10/138), Enterococcus spp. 5.80% (8/138), Staphylococcus spp. 4.35% (6/138), Corynebacterium spp. 3.62% (5/138), Enterobacter spp. 3.62% (5/138), Acinobacter spp. 2.90% (4/138), Serratia marcescens 2.17% (3/138), Proteus mirabilis 1.45% (2). Aeromonas hydrophylia, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Stenotropomonas multipholia contributed to 0.72% with one isolate each. For gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers (ESBLs) rates were 38% and 22.22% respectively. For Pseudomonas aerugenosa imipenem-cilastatin resistance rate was 18.84%. For gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was 28.62%. The vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) rate was 1.18%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent as a cause of infection in adult cancer patients with febrile neutropenia at our institution, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia with high ESBLs rates being the most common pathogens. Blood stream infections followed by urinary tract infections were the most common sites of infection. The use of initial antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic episodes should be based on local bacterial spectrum and susceptibility/sensitivity patterns to prevent treatment failure with increased morbidity and mortality."

However, it is becoming more prevalent in temperate regions, and may be underdiagnosed. Here, pyomyositis is encountered as a complication of perforated diverticulitis, which has not been previously reported. A 61-year-old Caucasian man initially presented in respiratory distress and was diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation. The patient was taking high-dose prednisone, 60 mg daily for the past 2 years. Initially, he was afebrile, normotensive, tachycardic to 178 beats/minute and tachypneic to 28 breaths/minute, requiring noninvasive ventilation to maintain oxygenation. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis of 16.7x103/muL, and blood cultures grew Escherichia coli. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started but leukocytosis and bacteremia persisted on repeated tests. On the seventh hospital day, a CT scan of the abdomen was performed for complaints of abdominal pain, and the patient was diagnosed with Hinchey stage 3 diverticulitis. A Hartmann's procedure was performed with intraoperative findings of purulent peritonitis. Intraoperative cultures grew E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The patient continued to have leukocytosis of 15.1x103/muL despite surgical therapy. He began to complain of left lower extremity pain, and a CT scan on hospital day 24 revealed gluteal intramuscular abscesses, which were percutaneously drained. Persistent symptoms prompted another CT scan on hospital day 28, which revealed additional intramuscular abscesses in the vastus lateralis muscle, which was also drained, with subsequent resolution of pain and normalization of inflammatory markers. This is the first case demonstrating pyomyositis as a complication of diverticulitis. While the mechanism of pyomyositis may not be unique, it is important to recognize the potential complications of frequently encountered diseases. In this critically ill and immunosuppressed patient, there was delayed diagnosis of both diverticulitis and pyomyositis, but the patient quickly improved once the diseases were recognized and treated."

The possibility of infecting a sick person in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is many times greater than in other hospital departments OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the epidemiological indicators and to determine the clinical types of HAI that are present in the ICU during the 5-year period in the St. Lukas District Hospital in Tarnow MATERIALS AND METHODS: HAI has been detected and documented in patients in ICU in the years 2012-2016 by the use of the active monitoring method. We studied patients who spent over 2 days in ICU with a general profile. These studies were conducted in accordance with the methodology recommended by Healthcare-Associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) RESULTS: Among 886 patients who were hospitalized for a total of 6711 days, HAI was diagnosed in 195 patients (22.0% incidence rate), the incidence density rate was 29.1 per 1000 person-days of hospitalization. The rate for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) was 12.5 per 1000 ventilator days, for Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CA-BSI) the rate was 8.2 per 1000 central line days, for Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CA-UTI) the rate was 3.3 per 1000 urinary catheter days. The average duration of a patient stay in ICU was 24 days (19 days for patients without HAI and 43 days for patients with HAI). The following microorganisms isolated from HAI were prevailing: Acinetobacter baumannii 46 (27%), Staphylococcus aureus 12 (21%), Enterococcus faecalis 17 (10%) CONCLUSIONS: A five-year HAI study in ICU showed that the most common types of infections were bloodstream infections and pneumonia. The incidence rate of VAP remained at similar levels in subsequent years. The CA-BSI rates were reduced over the next three years of the study, but their rise in the last year can prove the lack of stability of the preventive actions.

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and etiological agents of HAI in a Surgical ICU in Kazakhstan, and to assess the impact of these infections on ICU stay and mortality. Objective: To assess the rate of device-associated infections and causative HAI etiological agents in an ICU at the National Research Center for Oncology and Transplantation (NRCOT) in Astana, Kazakhstan. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a 12-bed ICU at the NRCOT, Astana, Kazakhstan. We enrolled all patients who were admitted to the ICU from January, 2014 through November 2015, aged 18 to 90 years of age who developed an HAI. Results: The most common type of HAI was surgical site infection (SSI), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related blood stream infection (BSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI). The most common HAI was SSI with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most common etiological agent. The second most common HAI was VAP also with P. aeruginosa followed by BSI which was also associated with P. aeruginosa (in 2014) and Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (in 2015) as the most common etiological agents causing these infections. Conclusion: We found that HAI among our study population were predominantly caused by gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the only study that describes ICU-related HAI situation from a country within the Central Asian region. Many developing countries such as Kazakhstan lack surveillance systems which could effectively decrease incidence of HAIs and healthcare costs for their treatment. The epidemiological data on HAI in Kazakhstan currently is underrepresented and poorly reported in the literature. Based on this and previous studies, we propose that the most important interventions to prevent HAI at the NRCOT and similar Healthcare Institutions in Kazakhstan are active surveillance, regular infection control audits, rational and effective antibacterial therapy, and general hygiene measures."

Under some cases of immune suppression (especially with corticosteroid administration), the nematode involved disseminates, leading to an amplified, possibly lethal hyper-infection syndrome. Case presentation: A 56-year-old Nepalese man presenting with chief complaints of nausea, vomiting, joint pain and abdominal cramps was admitted to Sumeru Hospital. His past history revealed: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), systemic hypertension and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had been treated with oral prednisolone (60 mg gl-1) for 8 days due to a presumed exacerbation of his COPD. Sequentially, he developed haemoptysis, chest tightness, frequent wheezing and worsening cough. Bronchoscopy showed severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage; microbiological examination of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was recommended. Examination of an acid fast bacilli stain preparation of BAL revealed filariform larvae of Strongyloides. Stool specimen examination revealed larvae of Strongyloides. The physical condition of the patient began to deteriorate; a few days after admission, vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecium was isolated from a blood sample. He was treated with ivermectin and albendazole for strongyloides and linezolid plus vancomycin for E. faecium. However, the patient failed to recover from the illness and died. Conclusion: The findings of our study suggest that corticosteroid administration in strongyloidiasis can lead to the development of fatal strongyloides hyper-infection syndrome. Hence our experience suggests the need for early diagnosis of strongyloidiasis to avoid such an outcome. A deterioration of the patient's condition after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy in endemic areas should raise the possibility of strongyloidiasis."

However, making the correct diagnosis is rather difficult because the clinical presentation and findings of blood tests are non-specific. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old female complaining of dyspnea for 5 days with acute mitral regurgitation was transferred to our hospital. She had acute heart and respiratory failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Although infective endocarditis was suspected, repeated blood cultures and transesophageal echocardiography could not reveal any findings of infective endocarditis. Because the etiology of her condition was not determined by various examinations, mitral annuloplasty was required to treat her mitral regurgitation, and was performed for definitive diagnosis and treatment revealing the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve. Enterococcus faecalis was detected by cultures of the mitral valve and blood after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS It can be very difficult to diagnose infective endocarditis correctly, especially when a case fails to fulfill the modified Duke criteria. In such a case, only cardiac surgery might enable us to make an accurate diagnosis and save a patient's life."

Patients and methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients from the Chinese Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections (CARES) program between 2007 and 2016. Data on the clinicopathological factors and causative pathogens were collected. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) interpretive breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2017. Results: A total of 2,756 patients were included. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 9.5% (262/2,756). Multivariable analysis showed that the following independent risk factors were associated with the 30-day mortality: age &gt;60 years, pulmonary disease, tracheal cannula, infection occurring in intensive care unit (ICU), prior admission within 3 months, antibiotic use before infection, recent use of immunosuppressants, and multidrug-resistant organisms. In addition, 2,913 clinical isolates were collected. The Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 70.8% and 29.2% of all isolates, respectively. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (33.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.8%), and Enterococcus faecium (10.7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative pathogens. E. faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common Gram-positive pathogens. E. coli, A. baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae were more commonly found in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. Overall, the antibiotics tested in the CARES exhibited diminished susceptibility to pathogens over the study period, especially extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing isolates. Conclusion: Considering the current data set and high-level resistance of intra-abdominal pathogens to various antibiotics, further monitoring of the epidemiology of IAIs and their susceptibility to antibiotics through the CARES is warranted."

Methods: This study included 293 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. We compared the pathological bacteria that were detected in bacteriological cultures of sputum, mouthwash and gastric fluid on the second postoperative day with the pathogenic bacteria responsible for postoperative pneumonia. Results: Postoperative pneumonia occurred in 26 (8.8%) of the 293 patients. Enterobacter cloacae was detected most frequently in the perioperative bacteriological culture, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Detection of each pathogenic bacterium in the perioperative bacteriological culture was not associated with the occurrence of pneumonia, excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As the pathogens responsible for postoperative pneumonia, 32 bacteria were detected in 26 patients with postoperative pneumonia. Detection rate of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for postoperative pneumonia in a perioperative bacteriological culture was 43.8% in a sputum culture, 40.6% in a mouthwash culture and 65.6% in a gastric fluid culture. The detection rate of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for pneumonia was up to 78.1% in the combination of sputum and gastric fluid culture. Conclusions: Although the perioperative bacteriological culture does not seem to be useful for predicting the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia, it is useful for predicting the pathogenic bacteria responsible for pneumonia in cases of postoperative pneumonia. The perioperative bacteriological culture helps us to select appropriate antibiotics to treat pneumonia after esophagectomy."

METHODS: The clinical data of patients with COBSI in emergency department admitted to Huashan North Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University from January 2014 to December 2017 were collected, and the distribution and drug resistance of pathogen were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into community-acquired bloodstream infection (CABSI) group and health care-associated bloodstream infection (HCABSI) group according to clinical diagnosis. The source of patients, past health status, blood culture isolation of pathogens, drug sensitivity test results were recorded, and the trend of drug resistance of main pathogens to common antibiotics from 2014 to 2017 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 258 pathogens were isolated from patients, including 186 Gram-negative pathogens (G- pathogens, 72.09%) and 72 Gram-positive pathogens (G+ pathogens, 27.91%), while the fungal strain was not isolated. The two most frequently isolated G- pathogens causing CABSI were Escherichia coli (80 isolates, 65.57%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (24 isolates, 19.67%), including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Escherichia coli (37 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumonia (3 isolates), the average detection rates were 46.25% and 12.50% respectively. The two most frequently isolated G+ pathogens were Streptococcus (32 isolates, 57.14%) and Staphylococcus (15 isolates, 26.79%), but methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) had not been isolated. The two most frequently isolated G- pathogens causing HCABSI were Escherichia coli (45 isolates, 70.32%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (7 isolates, 10.94%), including ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli (20 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumonia (1 isolate), the average detection rate was 44.44% and 14.29%, respectively. The most frequently isolated G+ pathogens were Staphylococcus (10 isolates, 62.50%), Streptococcus (3 isolates, 18.75%) and Enterococcus faecium (3 isolates, 18.75%), including MRSA (3 isolates). ESBLs-positive Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were almost completely resistant to cefazolin and highly resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium, ceftriaxone and furadantin, with the drug resistance rates of higher than 50%, and the drug resistance rate was significantly higher than that of corresponding ESBLs-producing negative pathogens. Escherichia coli were completely sensitive to piperacillin tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, but Klebsiella pneumoniae had some resistance to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) were highly resistant to common antibiotics, while Streptococcus strains and MRSA had low resistance rates, and all pathogens were completely sensitive to linezolid and vancomycin. The average annual resistance rate of Escherichia coli to common antibiotics in CABSI group was increased, but the difference was significant only for ciprofloxacin (from 2014 to 2017, they were 37.5%, 28.6%, 52.6%, 65.2%, respectively, Z = 5.076, P = 0.024). The average annual resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumonia to cefazolin and ciprofloxacin in CABSI group and that of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone in HCABSI group showed an increasing trend without significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the main pathogens of emergency COBSI, ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli were more common, and the average annual drug resistance rate to common clinical antibiotics was increasing. The drug resistance of ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was more serious than that of ESBLs-producing negative pathogens, so antibiotics should be used rationally."

Moreover, these infants acquire commensal bacteria, which might become potentially harmful. On-ward transmission of these bacteria can cause outbreaks. AIM: To report the findings of a prospective surveillance of bacterial colonization and primary sepsis in preterm infants and neonates. METHODS: The results of the surveillance of bacterial colonization of the gut and the respiratory tract, targeting meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Gram-negative bacteria from November 2016 to March 2018 were analysed. Bacterial colonization was compared to surveillance of sepsis. FINDINGS: Six-hundred and seventy-one patients were admitted and 87.0 % (N=584) of the patients were screened; 48.3% (N=282) of the patients screened were colonized with at least one of the bacteria included in the screening; 26.2% of them (N=74) had multi-drug-resistant strains. A total of 534 bacterial isolates were found. The most frequently found species were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Three MRSA but no VRE were detected. The surveillance detected a K. pneumoniae cluster involving nine patients. There were 23 blood-culture-confirmed sepsis episodes; 60.9% (N=14) were caused by staphylococci. Gram-negative bacteria (one Klebsiella aerogenes and two E. cloacae) caused three sepsis episodes which were preceded by colonization with the respective isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of colonization provided a comprehensive overview of species and antibiotic resistance patterns. It allowed early detection of a colonization cluster. Knowledge of colonization and surveillance of sepsis is useful for guiding infection control measures and antibiotic treatment."

Both patients were diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer and underwent chemotherapy for 17 and 15 months, respectively. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a solid pancreatic tail tumor measuring 2.5 cm and 1.3 cm in diameter, respectively. Additionally, we observed dilatation of the upstream main pancreatic duct (MPD) and edematous parenchyma with peripancreatic inflammatory changes limited to the pancreatic tail. Both patients were diagnosed with moderately severe acute pancreatitis and received fluid resuscitation, an opioid analgesic, antibiotics, and a protease inhibitor. However, owing to unrelenting pain, we performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for pancreatic duct drainage in both patients. ERCP showed a stricture in the MPD in the pancreatic tail with upstream dilatation. A 5-Fr NPD tube was inserted to drain the dilated MPD, and cloudy pancreatic juice was drained. NPD tube placement led to pain relief in both patients. Pancreatic juice cultures grew Enterococcus faecium and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively.

Strongyloides has a unique auto-infective lifecycle such that it can persist in the human host for decades. In immunosuppressed patients, especially those on corticosteroids, potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis can occur, often with concurrent secondary infections. Herein, we present two immunocompromised patients with severe strongyloidiasis who presented with pneumonia, hemoptysis, and sepsis. Both patients were immigrants from developing countries and had received prolonged courses of corticosteroids prior to admission. Patient 1 also presented with a diffuse abdominal rash; a skin biopsy showed multiple intradermal Strongyloides larvae. Patient 1 had concurrent pneumonic nocardiosis and bacteremia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Patient 2 had concurrent Aspergillus and Candida pneumonia and developed an Aerococcus meningitis. Both patients had negative serologic tests for Strongyloides; patient 2 manifested intermittent eosinophilia. In both patients, the diagnosis was afforded by bronchoscopy with lavage. The patients were successfully treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and ivermectin. Patient 1 also received albendazole. Strongyloidiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemoptysis in immunocompromised patients with possible prior exposure to S. stercoralis."

We sought to determine the magnitude, etiology, and risk factors of CAP in children 5 years after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 10 in Ethiopia. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on the bacterial etiology and risk factors of CAP among children aged 0-15 years in 2 pediatric emergency departments in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Blood culture, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and amplification of pneumococcal lytA and cpsB genes were performed. Serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined by Quellung reaction and sequencing the cpsB gene. Results: Out of 643 eligible children, 549 were enrolled. The prevalence of bacteremic pneumonia was 5.6%. Staphylococcus aureus (26.5%) was the predominant pathogenic species, followed by Enterococcus faecium (11.8%), Escherichia coli (11.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.8%). In univariate analysis, parental smoking and nonvaccination with PCV10 were associated with bacteremic CAP. In multivariable analysis, female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.9), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) &lt;-2 SDs (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8), and lower chest indrawing (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.2-0.95) were independently associated with bacteremic CAP. The overall in-hospital case fatality rate was 2.37% (13/549), and WAZ &lt;-3 SDs (OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 3.95-46.12) was associated with mortality. Conclusions: Five years after the introduction of PCV10 in Ethiopia, S. aureus was the main cause of bacteremic CAP in children, the contribution of S. pneumoniae was low, and there was a high level of antibiotic resistance among isolates."

Added that a paucity of studies referred to ESKAPEEc in pediatric BSIs, our study aimed to demonstrate the longitudinal alterations of ESKAPEEc distribution and antibiogram in adult and pediatric BSIs in Southwest China. Methods: A multicenter retrospective surveillance study was launched from 2012 to 2017. Data of China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) was analyzed by Whonet 5.6 and Graphpad Prism 6 Software. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to examine and compare temporal changes. Results: A total of 32,259 strains was isolated, with 17.4% from pediatric BSIs. ESKAPEEc contributed to 58.67% (18,924/32,259) of BSIs, with 65.3% of adult BSIs and 27.2% of pediatric BSIs. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) were the two predominant species. Carbapenem resistance was prevalent in 0.76, 4.60, 9.47,13.66, 59.47% of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), respectively. The proportions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREFM) were 28.91% and 2.20%, respectively. Between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, E. coli and K. pneumonia showed significantly increased resistance rates to imipenem but decreased to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, while A. baumannii exhibited reduced resistances to almost all the beta-lactams tested. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to most of agents against Gram-positive ESKAPEEc did not significantly varied during the same timeframe. In comparison with those from adult BSIs, K. pneumoniae from pediatric BSIs exhibited high resistance rates to all the beta-lactams tested, especially to carbapenems (12.79% vs 3.87%), while A. baumannii showed low resistance rates to all the agents. Conclusions: Ongoing burden of ESKAPEEc in BSIs and increasing trend of imipenem resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae call for continued surveillance. Carbapenems are still active against Gram-negative ESKAPEEc, except for A. baumannii and vancomycin or linezolid is still effective against Gram-positive ESKAPEEc. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in children and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii in adults necessitate effective antimicrobial strategies in consideration of age stratification."

There have been rare case reports in previously healthy children and rarer are the cases with double etiology. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female Caucasian patient, aged 1 year and 8 months, who developed severe sepsis during flu evolution with predominant respiratory and cerebral manifestations. On admission, at skin level, there was noticed a necrotic coccygeal ulceration (with rapid increasing dimensions 0.5/0.5 cm in 24 hours), and with the transformation from a dry necrosis in a sphacelus at the periphery and progression of necrosis in depth. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with ecthyma gangrenosum from which Pseudomonsa aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from the samples that were harvested intraoperatively, decision that was taken considering the appearance of CT scan and the extremely rapid expansion of necrosis. Excisional debridement with necrectomy, lavage, and dressing being performed. The invasion of the fascia was excluded intraoperatively. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with Meropenem for 14 days was initiated, as well as amikacin and linezolid, the latter being replaced with teicoplanin for 14 days. Red blood cells transfusion, intravenous immunoglobulins, anticonvulsants were also administered. OUTCOMES: Under treatment the evolution was favorable. LESSONS: This case brings into discussion a double etiology of ecthyma gangrenosum, in a previously healthy child that occurred in the evolution of influenza.

This study aims to determine the prevalence and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Gram-positive pathogens at a tertiary care hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out from January, 2015 to December, 2017, at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. The clinical isolates were cultured, and identification was done using Vitek 2 culture system. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was done as per the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 2132 (29%) Gram-positive isolates, S. aureus (49%) was the most common encountered pathogen, followed by Enterococcus spp. (24.5%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%). Majority of the S. aureus were observed in patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (61.2%) followed by those suffering from respiratory (41%) and bloodstream infections (35%). Among the infections caused by S. aureus, the prevalence of methicillin resistance was 30%. While the MRSA isolates showed lower sensitivity toward co-trimoxazole (39%), clindamycin (30%), erythromycin (23%), and ciprofloxacin (10%), they showed higher susceptibility to linezolid (98%), vancomycin (98%), and teicoplanin (98%). All the isolates were found to be sensitive to daptomycin and tigecycline. While vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) formed 7.5%, the linezolid-resistant enterococcus species was as high as 4.1%. CONCLUSION: The study showed a high prevalence of MRSA and VRE, thereby emphasizing the increasing antimicrobial resistance pattern of the Gram-positive pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel antimicrobial stewardship to restrict the ongoing resistance rate among the isolates."

The objectives were to describe the incidence of MDR, extensive-drug-resistant (XDR), and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) organism growth in ICU patients admitted with traumatic injuries and to identify any risk factors associated with MDR growth. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective single-center cohort study of all ICU adult patients identified via the institution's trauma registry from January 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017. Patients were included if they had positive culture growth with susceptibility data taken during the index hospitalization. Patients were excluded if their cultures were drawn within 48 hours of emergency department triage. Study groups were defined based on the presence of at least one MDR pathogen during the index hospitalization. Results: A total of 2,578 charts were reviewed and 95 patients (mean age, 60 years; 66 males [69%]) with 201 total cultures were included. The majority of positive cultures were from respiratory (69%) and urinary (16%) sources. Of the 201 positive cultures, the majority of species identified was Enterobacteriaceae (47%), Staphylococcus (32%), Enterococcus (7%), Acinetobacter (5%), and Pseudomonas (3%). Of the 95 patients with positive cultures, the incidence of MDR, XDR, and PDR organisms was found to be 31%, 17%, and 0%, respectively. Augmented renal clearance (ARC) was the only risk factor associated with an increased risk for MDR organism growth (adjusted odds ratio 9.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56-37.41; p = 0.001). Conclusions: In this cohort of critically ill trauma patients, the incidence of an MDR pathogen occurred in 31% of patients. This is the first study to find an association of ARC and multi-drug resistance, which should be further validated as a potential cause for MDR organisms."

DESIGN: Multicentre descriptive and analytic cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Eight EDs and four clinical microbiology departments in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: Adults visiting the ED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Swabs from nose, throat and rectum were collected and analysed for MRSA, ESBL, VRE and CPE. The primary outcome was the prevalence of MRB carriage, and secondary outcomes relation to risk factors among ED patients. RESULTS: We included 5117 patients in the study. Median age was 68 years (54-77) and gender was equally distributed. In total, 266 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.6 to 5.8) were colonised with at least one MRB. No significant difference was observed between male and female patients, between age groups and between university and regional hospitals. Only 5 of the 266 patients with MRB were colonised with two of the included bacteria and none with more than two. CPE prevalence was 0.1% (95% CI 0.0 to 0.2), MRSA prevalence was 0.3% (95% CI 0.2 to 0.5), VRE prevalence was 0.4% (95% CI 0.3 to 0.6) and ESBL prevalence was 4.5% (95% CI 3.9 to 5.1). Risk factors for MRB carriage were previous antibiotic treatment, previous hospital stay, having chronic respiratory infections, use of urinary catheter and travel to Asia, Oceania or Africa. CONCLUSION: Every 20th patient arriving to a Danish ED brings MRB to the hospital. ESBL is the most common MRB in the ED. The main risk factors for MRB carriage are recent antibiotic use and travel abroad. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03352167;Post-results."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the features of the etiological structure of neonatal pneumonia complicated by BPD, and to determine the sensitivity of pathogens to antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 194 preterm infants with VAP, birth weight from 780 to 2820 g and gestational age from 27 to 37 weeks was conducted. A microbiological study of washings from the respiratory tract was conducted by standard qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Respiratory tract infections caused by E. coli (with hemolytic properties), Enterococcus spp. (with hemolytic properties), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, various types of mycoplasmas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida krusei were found 4- 13 times more frequent in preterm infants with BPD than in preterm infants without BPD and more mature infants with or without this complication. BPD developed 7- 11 times more frequent in preterm infants with prolonged VAP and change in pathogens than in preterm infants with VAP without change of agent. BPD developed 5- 7 times more frequent in preterm infants with the association of pathogens than in preterm infants with a monoinfection. Massive colonization of respiratory tract pathogens by 1- 3 days of life (lg4 colony forming units in 1 ml and above) was an unfavorable prognostic factor for the development of VAP, complicated by BPD. CONCLUSION: The reduction in the frequency of BPD is might be possible with timeous and adequate antibacterial therapy of VAP."

In 15-30% of the IE cases, standard blood cultures remain sterile. We aimed at identifying the causative agent of a blood-culture-negative IE by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMGS). A 54-year old woman diagnosed with community-onset pneumonia by a general practitioner, was admitted with dyspnea, cough and fever. The patient's blood cultures were repeatedly negative. The transesophageal echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography showed an echo density on the left coronary leaflet of the aortic valve and signs suggestive of a ruptured abscess of the mitro-aortic junction. The patient underwent a semi-urgent aortic valve replacement by a mechanical prosthetic valve. We extracted DNA from the surgically-removed fresh valve tissue. The extraction procedure included bacterial/fungal DNA enrichment procedure. Nextera XT library prepared from the valve DNA extract was sequenced (2 x 250) on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. Sequence reads were mapped against bacterial genomic sequences, 16S rRNA genes and clade-specific taxonomic markers. Most of the 103,136 sequencing reads classified as bacterial were assigned to Neisseria meningitidis. In line with these data, mapping of reads against clade-specific and 16S rRNA gene markers revealed N. meningitidis as the most represented species. Assembled metagenomic fragments had the best average nucleotide identity (ANI) with N. meningitidis. Comparison of assembled contigs to reference alleles showed that this strain belongs to the ST-41/44 complex. N. meningitidis is commonly associated with meningitis and/or septicemia but should not be neglected as a causative agent of IE, which became exceedingly rare with the introduction of antibiotics. Our data show that WMGS may be used as a diagnostic procedure to strengthen the diagnosis of IE and to obtain draft genomic sequence of the pathogen and typing information."

We describe a case of E. hirae bacteremia and pneumonia in a bird breeder and its potential relationship with regorafenib, a tirosin kinase inhibitor (TKI). METHODS: Descriptive study and review of the literature through a PubMed search of the cases described previously to date. RESULTS: Only seventeen cases have been described, mainly endocarditis, pyelonephritis, and intraabdominal infections. No cases of pneumonia have been reported so far. The recent increase in TKI use opens a new field to explore in infectious diseases due to both the exposure to these immunosuppressive drugs and the increased survival of subjects with severe underlying comorbidities. CONCLUSION: In patients in contact with birds, immunosuppressed by their underlying morbidities and treated with regorafenib, clinicians should be aware of an increased risk of unusual potentially severe infections."

Results of the ESC-EORP EURO-ENDO (European infective endocarditis) registry: a prospective cohort study.ABSTRACT:AIMS: The EURO-ENDO registry aimed to study the management and outcomes of patients with infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective cohort of 3116 adult patients (2470 from Europe, 646 from non-ESC countries), admitted to 156 hospitals in 40 countries between January 2016 and March 2018 with a diagnosis of IE based on ESC 2015 diagnostic criteria. Clinical, biological, microbiological, and imaging [echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) scan, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT)] data were collected. Infective endocarditis was native (NVE) in 1764 (56.6%) patients, prosthetic (PVIE) in 939 (30.1%), and device-related (CDRIE) in 308 (9.9%). Infective endocarditis was community-acquired in 2046 (65.66%) patients. Microorganisms involved were staphylococci in 1085 (44.1%) patients, oral streptococci in 304 (12.3%), enterococci in 390 (15.8%), and Streptococcus gallolyticus in 162 (6.6%). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed in 518 (16.6%) patients and presented with cardiac uptake (major criterion) in 222 (42.9%) patients, with a better sensitivity in PVIE (66.8%) than in NVE (28.0%) and CDRIE (16.3%). Embolic events occurred in 20.6% of patients, and were significantly associated with tricuspid or pulmonary IE, presence of a vegetation and Staphylococcus aureus IE. According to ESC guidelines, cardiac surgery was indicated in 2160 (69.3%) patients, but finally performed in only 1596 (73.9%) of them. In-hospital death occurred in 532 (17.1%) patients and was more frequent in PVIE. Independent predictors of mortality were Charlson index, creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL, congestive heart failure, vegetation length &gt; 10 mm, cerebral complications, abscess, and failure to undertake surgery when indicated. CONCLUSION: Infective endocarditis is still a life-threatening disease with frequent lethal outcome despite profound changes in its clinical, microbiological, imaging, and therapeutic profiles."

Valves are the most frequently affected sites. Here, we described a 49-year-old female, who admitted to respiratory outpatient department in the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University for long time of fever. Chest computer tomography (CT) found a thick wall cavity in the apex of the right lung with smooth wall and fluid plane, without enhancement, which was considered as inflammation and tuberculosis to be excluded. Echocardiography showed vegetations on the aortic valve, where abscess was found on the root. Accidentally in surgery, a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was found. The surgeon closed the PDA and performed aortic valve prosthetic valve replacement. Bacterial colony of coccus was found in the pathological tissue, which was consistent with the diagnosis of valvular degeneration with infection. Lung lesion was obviously absorbed after 6 weeks of treatment with vancomycin, which has been confirmed as a sensitive antibacterial drug to Enterococcus faecalis. Overall, the pulmonary lesion was caused by the detachment of bacterial neoplasm of aortic valve, which has passed through the PDA and entered the pulmonary circulation."

We present the fifth known case of E. hirae endocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian female presented with fever, hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a two-week history of lightheadedness. Her previous medical history included COPD, recurrent DVT, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Physical exam was notable for expiratory wheezes and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right sternal border. 2D echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis. The patient underwent right and left heart catheterization, where she was found to have severe aortic stenosis and mild pulmonary hypertension. She subsequently underwent minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a bovine pericardial valve, bilateral atrial cryoablation, and clipping of the left atrial appendage. Her aortic valve was found to have a bicuspid, thickened appearance with calcifications, multiple small vegetations, and a root abscess beneath the right coronary cusp. With a new suspicion of infective endocarditis, the patient was placed on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Intra-operative blood cultures were negative. A tissue culture from the aortic valve vegetations identified Enterococcus hirae susceptible to ampicillin through MALDI-TOF. Antibiotic treatment was then switched to IV ampicillin and ceftriaxone; she declined aminoglycoside treatment due to toxicity concerns. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged with 6 weeks of antibiotics. To date, she continues to be followed with no signs of relapsing disease. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this case constitutes the fifth known case of E. hirae endocarditis, and the second case to have been identified with MALDI-TOF and treated with ampicillin and ceftriaxone. This case reinforces the efficacy of ampicillin and ceftriaxone for the treatment of E. hirae endocarditis."

Linezolid has potential adverse effects like bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy and hyponatremia. One of the extremely rare reported adverse effects of the drug is hypoglycaemia. We present a case of Linezolid toxicity presenting as resistant hypoglycemia, bone marrow suppression and severe hyponatremia all together in a single patient. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of an 82 years old gentleman with no known chronic co-morbidities. He was started on Linezolid 600 mg twice a day for 10 days by a local doctor possibly for some minor infection post hip surgery. He was in respiratory distress on arrival. Blood sugars showed severe hypoglycemia of 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L). He was admitted in intensive care unit and started on injectable antibiotics and 5% dextrose infusion and sugars were strictly monitored. His blood tests revealed severe hyponatremia with sodium level of 119 mEq/L and haemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 gm/dL, leucocytes of 6500/microL, platelets of 82 000/microL. The infection markers were normal throughout. The platelet count went progressively down from 82 000/microL on admission to 20 000/microL 2 days later; before it started rising back. Similarly there was drop in Hemoglobin and white cell counts. He required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressures. The blood sugar levels stabilized after the same. However patient had suffered acute lung injury secondary to aspiration and became NIV dependent and eventually passed away. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our case was unique in a way that our patient had adverse effects of linezolid like myelosuppression as well as the rare side effects of hypoglycemia at the same time. This combination of adverse events has never been described in the past to our knowledge. All the adverse effects responded to antibiotic de-challenge in our case. We had ruled out the possibility of other causes of Hypoglycemia such as sepsis, insulinoma, alcohol excess, malnutrition or hypoadrenalism. We searched the PubMed database and found four case reports out of which two were diabetics and other two were non diabetics. Out of 15 cases described by Vishwanathan et al only three cases were non diabetics. Our patient was non diabetic as well. Therefore our case is only the sixth reported case of hypoglycemia in non diabetic receiving Linezolid to our knowledge."

The characteristics of secondary infection, which are well known to clinicians, need to be re-examined in detail, and their understanding among clinicians needs to be updated accordingly. AIM: This study aims to investigate the characteristics and drug resistance of pathogens causing severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) secondary infection, to objectively present infection situation, and to provide reference for improved clinical management. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 55 consecutive patients with SAP who developed secondary infection with an accurate evidence of bacterial/fungal culture from 2016 to 2018. The statistics included the spectrum and distribution of pathogens, the drug resistance of main pathogens, and associations between multiple infectious parameters and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 181 strains of pathogens were isolated from (peri)pancreas; bloodstream; and respiratory, urinary, and biliary systems in 55 patients. The strains included 98 g-negative bacteria, 58 g-positive bacteria, and 25 fungi. Bloodstream infection (36.5%) was the most frequent infectious complication, followed by (peri)pancreatic infection (32.0%). Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were predominant among gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacterial infections were mainly caused by Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus spp. Fungal infections were predominantly caused by Candida spp. The drug resistance of pathogens causing SAP secondary infection was generally higher than the surveillance level. Patients in the death group were older (55 +- 13 years vs. 46 +- 14 years; p = 0.039) and had longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay (14 vs. 8; p = 0.026) than those in the survival group. A. baumannii infection (68.4% vs. 33%; p = 0.013), number of pathogens >= 4 (10 vs. 6; p = 0.005), pancreatic infection (14 vs. 15, p = 0.024), and urinary infection (8 vs. 5; p = 0.019) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria are the main pathogens causing SAP secondary infection, in which nosocomial infections play a major role. The drug resistance profile of gram-negative bacteria is seriously threatening, and the commonly used antibiotics in SAP are gradually losing their effectiveness. Much attention should be paid to the rational use of antibiotics, and strategies should be established for infection prevention in SAP."

Blood samples showed a Bacillus cereus infection. The patient was successfully treated for a mycotic aortic aneurysm secondary to Bacillus cereus bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report a rare of an infected aneurysm of the thoracic aorta probably caused by Bacillus cereus. Although infected aneurysms have been described well before, an aneurysm infected with Bacillus cereus is rare. Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive spore-building bacterium, can produce biofilms, which attach to catheters. It has recently emerged as a new organism that can cause serious infection."

However, quality data from large studies is lacking. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics and analyze the prognostic factors of EE in the GAMES cohort. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients from 35 Spanish centers from 2008 to 2016. Characteristics and outcomes of 516 cases of EE were compared with those of 3,308 cases of nonenterococcal endocarditis (NEE). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were performed to investigate risk factors for in-hospital and 1-year mortality, as well as relapses. RESULTS: Patients with EE were significantly older; more frequently presented chronic lung disease, chronic heart failure, prior endocarditis, and degenerative valve disease; and had higher median age-adjusted Charlson score. EE more frequently involved the aortic valve and prosthesis (64.3% vs. 46.7%; p &lt; 0.001; and 35.9% vs. 28.9%; p = 0.002, respectively) but less frequently pacemakers/defibrillators (1.5% vs. 10.5%; p &lt; 0.001), and showed higher rates of acute heart failure (45% vs. 38.3%; p = 0.005). Cardiac surgery was less frequently performed in EE (40.7% vs. 45.9%; p = 0.024). No differences in in-hospital and 1-year mortality were found, whereas relapses were significantly higher in EE (3.5% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.035). Increasing Charlson score, LogEuroSCORE, acute heart failure, septic shock, and paravalvular complications were risk factors for mortality, whereas prior endocarditis was protective and persistent bacteremia constituted the sole risk factor for relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Besides other baseline and clinical differences, EE more frequently affects prosthetic valves and less frequently pacemakers/defibrillators. EE presents higher rates of relapse than NEE."

We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism. The patient was successfully treated with a four-week course of linezolid according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing.

The authors present the case of a previously healthy male adolescent, with complaints of fatigue and chest pain, who was diagnosed with Enterococcus faecalis-associated acute primary lung abscess. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 17-year old boy was admitted to the pediatric ward due to a one-week history of fatigue, inspiratory left side chest pain, dry cough and nasal obstruction. On admission at the emergency department, he was afebrile, with no signs of respiratory distress, but with diminished breath sounds on the left side. A chest x-ray showed a round opacity on the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe; he was discharged with oral amoxicillin 1000 mg three times a day with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Due to the worsening of the productive cough with purulent stinking sputum he was re-evaluated after 4 days. Laboratory studies showed a leukocyte count of 15200/uL and a c-reactive protein of 172 mg/l. The chest computed tomography scan was suggestive of a consolidation of the left lower lobe base and a central abscess. An intravenous course of ceftriaxone and clindamycin was initiated, with a favourable clinical evolution. The bronchofibroscopy performed on day four after his admission revealed the presence of a tracheal bronchus and numerous purulent secretions. Culture examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples was positive (> 10^5) for Enterococcus faecalis. No complications were registered during his stay in the pediatric ward. He was discharged after a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin, with the recommendation to complete a four-week course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. On his reevaluation 4 weeks after his discharge, he was asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of considering Enterococcus faecalis as an etiologic agent in cases of non-resolving or complicated cases of pneumonia, such as lung abscesses, even in young patients with no comorbidities or risk factors."

","SPECIES:Enterococcus CDCPNS-E3ID:32140361TITLE:Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia: A Rare Complication of Daptomycin Therapy.ABSTRACT:Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic with great efficacy targeting gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare complication of daptomycin therapy, with a poorly understood etiology thought to involve the accumulation of the drug in pulmonary surfactant inducing inflammation. We present a 56-year-old male with a history of spinal epidural abscess being treated with intravenous daptomycin, who presented to the emergency department with fever, developed worsening shortness of breath, and was subsequently discovered to have eosinophilia of pulmonary secretions via bronchoalveolar lavage. Daptomycin was discontinued, and he underwent treatment with corticosteroids, resulting in full resolution of symptoms. Diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Identification may be further complicated by the fact that symptoms can present anywhere from days to weeks after starting the therapy. This complication is very responsive to treatment with corticosteroids and cessation of daptomycin, but recognition is essential. With an increasing use of daptomycin subsequent to continued emergence of antibiotic resistance, it is essential that physicians are aware of this rare complication of daptomycin therapy."

Methods: The retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain the antibiotic prescription rate, pathogen detection rate, and isolation rate of drug-resistant bacteria of the inpatients in 66 hospitals of Shanghai in 2015 and 2017. Results: Although the detection rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria in sputum specimens has decreased, the clinical pathogen detection still relied mainly on sputum specimens in 2017. Among the sputum specis, the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia (ESBL-ESC), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2017 were 66.67%, 32.46%, 61.74%, 32.01% and 58.55% respectively. The detection rates of ESBL-ESC, ESBL-KP, CRAB, CRPA in 2017 were increased while the MRSA was decreased than 2015 (P<0.001). Among the blood samples, the detection rates of ESBL-ESC, ESBL-KP, CRAB, CRPA, MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp (VRE) in 2017 were 53.71%, 31.43%, 50.80%, 19.43%, 43.87% and 0.55% respectively. The detection rates of ESBL-KP, CRAB, CRPA and MRSA increased while the rates of ESBL-ESC and VRE decreased compared with 2015 (P<0.005). The pathogens of multi-drug resistant bacteria were mainly detected from sputum specimens in 2017, which were all higher than detected from the blood specimens (P<0.001). Conclusions: Most of the multi-drug resistant bacteria in Shanghai, especially in Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa are mainly detected from sputum specimens, indicating that the actual drug resistance may be overestimated."

Here, we present a fatal case of HLH secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection complicated by both anti-viral drug resistance and sepsis from multiple MDROs including pandrug-resistant superbug bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy, six-year-old boy presented with a 45-day history of fever prior to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and hemorrhagic colitis, both associated with CMV. On hospital admission, the patient was found to be colonized with multiple, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenamase-producing organisms (CPO). He eventually developed respiratory, urine and bloodstream infections with highly drug-resistant, including pandrug-resistant bacteria, which could not be controlled by antibiotic treatment. Antiviral therapy also failed to contain his CMV infection and the patient succumbed to overwhelming bacterial and viral infection. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the MDR bacteria and metagenomic analysis of his blood sample revealed an unusual accumulation of a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in a single patient, including antiviral resistance to ganciclovir, and resistance mechanisms to all currently available antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The case highlights both the risk of acquiring MDR superbugs and the severity of these infections in HLH patients."

However, little is known regarding the net prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens across all patients with community-onset sepsis or the outcomes associated with unnecessarily broad empiric treatment. Objective: To elucidate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and the outcomes associated with both undertreatment and overtreatment in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 17 430 adults admitted to 104 US hospitals between January 2009 and December 2015 with sepsis and positive clinical cultures within 2 days of admission. Data analysis took place from January 2018 to December 2019. Exposures: Inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (ie, >=1 pathogen nonsusceptible to all antibiotics administered on the first or second day of treatment) and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy (ie, active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE]; ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative [CTX-RO] organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] gram-negative organisms when none of these were isolated). Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and empiric treatment rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms and associations of inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy with in-hospital mortality were assessed, adjusting for baseline characteristics and severity of illness. Results: Of 17 430 patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [57-81] years; 9737 [55.9%] women), 2865 (16.4%) died in the hospital. The most common culture-positive sites were urine (9077 [52.1%]), blood (6968 [40.0%]), and the respiratory tract (2912 [16.7%]). The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (5873 [33.7%]), S aureus (3706 [21.3%]), and Streptococcus species (2361 [13.5%]). Among 15 183 cases in which all antibiotic-pathogen susceptibility combinations could be calculated, most (12 398 [81.6%]) received adequate empiric antibiotics. Empiric therapy targeted resistant organisms in 11 683 of 17 430 cases (67.0%; primarily vancomycin and anti-Pseudomonal beta-lactams), but resistant organisms were uncommon (MRSA, 2045 [11.7%]; CTX-RO, 2278 [13.1%]; VRE, 360 [2.1%]; ESBLs, 133 [0.8%]). The net prevalence for at least 1 resistant gram-positive organism (ie, MRSA or VRE) was 13.6% (2376 patients), and for at least 1 resistant gram-negative organism (ie, CTX-RO, ESBL, or CRE), it was 13.2% (2297 patients). Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment (inadequate empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.37; P = .02; unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.40; P = .007). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, most patients with community-onset sepsis did not have resistant pathogens, yet broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality. These findings underscore the need for better tests to rapidly identify patients with resistant pathogens and for more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric sepsis treatment."

Infection is the most morbid complication of ERCP and among the most common causes of ERCP-related death. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, obstructive jaundice and abnormal liver function tests. Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation. After receiving intravenous antibiotics for acute cholecystitis, the patient was discharged. Two weeks later, an endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated gallstones and CBD dilation of up to 6.4 mm with 2 filling defects. An ERCP was performed with a papillotomy and stone extraction. Twenty-four hours post-ERCP the patient developed a fever, chills, bilirubinemia and elevated liver function tests. Ascending cholangitis was empirically treated using Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole. However, the patient remained febrile, with a diffusely tender abdomen and elevated inflammatory markers. A CT revealed a very small hypodense lesion in the seventh liver segment. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive Klebsiella Pneumonia and Enterococcus Hirae were identified, and the antibiotics were switched to Imipenem and Cilastatin. The hypodense lesion in the liver increased to 1.85 cm and a new hypodense lesion was seen in the right psoas. At day 10 post-ERCP, the patient started having low back pain and difficulty walking. MRI revealed L4-L5 discitis with a large epidural abscess, spanning L1-S1 and compressing the spinal cord. Decompressive laminectomy of L5 was done and Klebsiella pneumonia was identified. Due to continued drainage from the wound, high fever, we performed a total body CT which revealed increased liver and iliopsoas abscess. Decompressive laminectomy was expanded to include L2-L4 and multiple irrigations were done. Gentamycin and Vancomycin containing polymethylmethacrylate beads were implanted locally and drainage catheters were placed before wound closure. Multidisciplinary panel discussion was performed, and it was decided to continue with a non invasive approach . CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of complications and individualized therapy by a multi-disciplined team is important for managing post-ERCP septic complications. Particular attention should be given to adequate coverage by empiric antibiotics."

This FDA cleared technology can detect 5 of the most prevalent pathogens causing bacteremia (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecium). Because the significance of discordant results between the T2Bacteria assay and blood culture (BC) remains a challenge, in this case series we reviewed the medical records of patients who had a positive T2Bacteria test and a concurrent negative BC. METHODS: Among 233 participants, we identified 20 patients with 21 (9%) discordant T2Bacteria-positive/BC-negative (T2+/BC-) results. We classified these results based on clinical cultures and clinical evidence. RESULTS: When we analyzed these 21 discordant results in-depth, 11 (52.5%) fulfilled criteria for probable BSI, 4 (19%) for possible BSI, and 6 (28.5%) were presumptive false positives. Among the probable/possible BSIs, discordant results were often associated with patients diagnosed with closed space and localized infections [pyelonephritis (n = 7), abscess (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 1), infected hematoma (n = 1), and osteomyelitis (n = 1)]. Also, within the preceding 2 days of the T2+/BC- blood sample, 80% (16/20) of the patients had received at least one dose of an antimicrobial agent which was active against the T2Bacteria-detected pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of discrepant results, the T2Bacteria assay detected a plausible pathogen that was supported by clinical and/or microbiologic data. Discrepancies appear to be associated with closed space and localized infections and the recent use of effective antibacterial agents. The clinical significance and potential implications of such discordant results should be further investigated."

It typically causes pulmonary disease, but it can also cause extrapulmonary disease. Immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk of developing the infection, but it has been reported in individuals with competent immune system as well. We present a unique case of infectious endocarditis (IE) due to a R. equi infection in an immunocompetent patient. A 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, systolic heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery for coronary and valvular heart disease. His transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe aortic stenosis and multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and simultaneous aortic valve replacement. Intraoperatively, there was exudative material covering his aortic valve, which was sent for tissue culture. Tissue culture was positive for R. equi and Enterococcus faecium.  R. equi endocarditis is a rare presentation of this organism. R. equi endocarditis is a very challenging diagnosis due to its varying presentation compared to typical IE. Detailed history taking and physical exam are extremely important to determine if further evaluation is needed. Prolonged oral and intravenous antibiotics are recommended for effective treatment."

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

A large number of people die annually due to infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, with millions more suffering from serious infectious complications. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria isolates among culture requested patients at University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on all culture-positive patients' results at University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. RESULTS: Of the 2,161 bacterial isolates, the overall prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria was 40.5% (876/ 2,161). The multidrug-resistance rate of Gram-negative bacteria was 52.4% (493/942) and Gram-positive bacteria was 31.4% (383/1,219). From all isolates, 22.3% (481/2,161) were from wound discharge followed by 19.57% (428/ 2,161) from blood and 18.14% (224/2,161) from urine. The predominant bacteria isolated were S. aureus (44.1% (952/2,161)) followed by E. coli (16.6% (359/2,161)), Klebsiella species (13.2% (179/2,161)), and Citrobacter (4% (86/2,161)). The isolates showed high levels of resistance to ampicillin (81.99% (692/844)), cotrimoxazole (66.62% (531/797)), and penicillin (62.66% (381/608)) and lower resistance to vancomycin (6.79% (46/677)), amikacin (20% (18/95)), and nitrofurantoin (20.90% (21/110)). Primary MDR isolates were Serratia species (83.3% (5/6)), Enterobacter species (66.7% (20/30)), Klebsiella pneumonia (65.3% (89/176)), and Enterococcus species (57.1% (8/14)). The majority of MDR isolates were from inpatients (58.6% (p-value < 0.0001)), males (53.77%), age group < 2 years (30.7%), and blood sample (25.22%). CONCLUSIONS: A higher level of resistance to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, penicillin and lower level of resistance to vancomycin, amikacin, and tobramycin were detected. Slightly lower overall rates of multidrug-resistant bacteria are isolated and a higher resistance rate is observed on Serratia species, Enterobacter species, K. pneumonia, Enterococcus species, and E. coli. Hospital admission is highly associated with the isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Hence patient hospital stay should be considered in the prevention of multidrug resistant bacterial infections."

Methods: A total of 1 872 neonates, who were admitted into NICU of Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital and subjected to mechanical ventilation from October 2016 to June 2018, were enrolled in the study. The neonates who met the diagnostic criteria of VAP were selected as the case group, and those who were treated with ventilator for 48 hours at the same time were regarded as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of VAP. Results: Of the 1 872 neonates who underwent the mechanical ventilation, the VAP occurred in 160 cases with the incidence rate of 8.5% (160 cases). The 227 specimens were collected. Gram-positive bacteria (n=116, 51.1%) were the main pathogens. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii. By Chi-square test, birth weight, birth age, Apgar score, duration of ventilator, and whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension were influencing factors. The result of logistic regression analysis showed that compared with no pregnancy included hypertension, the first aid measure at birth was initial resuscitation, and the MV time <= 5 days, the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates included: their mothers with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, using of tracheal intubation and ventilator time more than 5 days. Conclusion: The incidence of VAP in neonates receiving continuous MV therapy in neonatal intensive care unit is higher. Gram-positive bacteria are the main pathogens. VAP in neonates is related to whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension, MV duration and tracheal intubation."

All isolates were confirmed by molecular methods (16SrRNA and E. faecium ddl genes) and tested for disk diffusion. PCR was used to detect aac(6')-aph(2''), vanA and vanB resistance genes, and asa1, cylA, ace, esp, gelE and hyl virulence genes. VREfm and high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) representative isolates were selected to characterize by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Of 173 isolates, 73 (42.2%), 146 (84.4%), and 0 (0.0%) were vanA-containing VREfm, aac(6')-aph(2'')-positive HLGR, and vanB-positive. Independent predictors of VREfm infection were hematological malignancies (P = 0.001) and previous hospitalizations (P = 0.007). Observed mortality rate was 34.7%. Independent predictors of BSI-related mortality were endotracheal intubations (P < 0.001), gastrointestinal diseases (P = 0.002), and pulmonary disease (P < 0.001). All VREfm were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. The esp, hyl, ace, asa1, cylA, and gelE genes were detected at 55.9, 22.5, 2.9, 2.3, 1.7, and 1.2%, respectively. The esp gene was significantly associated with VREfm compared to VSEfm (P = 0.001). PFGE analysis revealed 23 clones, with 7 major clones. The MLST analysis revealed the following five sequence types: ST80, ST17, ST117, ST132, and ST280, all belonging to CC17. The emergence and expansion of VREfm CC17 with limited antibiotic options in our hospital present a serious public health menace and represent challenges to infection control."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%. The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem increased annually. The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones, Aminoglycosides were <5% even when compared to carbapenems. Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

This study evaluates the characteristics of these patients, in addition to the type, source, and outcome of sepsis and septic shock, in a university tertiary hospital in Palestine. It also studies the most common organisms encountered in these patients. Materials and methods: This is retrospective observational chart review study of all adult admissions to the intensive care unit over a period of 2 years. The presence of sepsis and septic shock was assessed and documented based on the Third International Consensus Definitions (Sepsis-3). Data regarding demographics, severity, comorbidities, source of infection, microbiology, length of stay, and outcomes (dead/alive at discharge from ICU) were recorded. Results: A total number of 174 patients were included. The mean age was 57.4 years, with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes being the leading comorbidities encountered in them. Respiratory infections were the most common site of sepsis, found in around 71% of patients, followed by urinary tract infections. More than 70% of cases were due to hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Acinetobacter species were the most common gram-negative organisms encountered, while Enterococcus was the most common gram-positive organisms. Around 54% of patients had multidrug-resistant organisms. The average length of stay in the ICU was 8 days. The average mortality rate was 39.7%, which is higher among septic shock patients. Conclusion: Both sepsis and septic shock carry high morbidity and mortality rates, and they are very frequent among critically ill patients. Special care and developing management bundles are crucial in controlling and preventing this threat. How to cite this article: Rabee HA, Tanbour R, Nazzal Z, Hamshari Y, Habash Y, Anaya A, et al.

The aim of the study was to analyze the microbial factors of HAIs and the drug resistance of microorganisms to selected antibiotics and their consumption. Material and Methods: The retrospective study included 3708 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Teaching Hospital in Wroclaw, who were diagnosed with 742 HAIs in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018. The aim of the study was the analysis of microorganisms isolated in the respective clinical forms of HAIs, including the occurrence of ""alert pathogens"", presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and consumption of selected antibiotics. Findings: During the study period, 846 microorganisms were cultured in patients with HAIs, and among them, Acinetobacter baumannii MDR represented 31.8%; Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBLs, 11.3%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR, 4.1% and MRSA, 2.2%; and Enterococcus spp. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 1.3%. Among all the pathogens, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were dominant (71.6%). Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 21.6% and 7%, respectively. The total number of strains responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central line-associated blood stream infection (CLA-BSI) was as follows: 458 (54.1%), 274 (32.4%), and 114 (13.5%), respectively. Among the etiological factors of VAP, there was a prevalence of A. baumannii MDR (41.9%), as well as in the case of UTI (21.9%). With regards to CLA-BSI, MRCNS (29.8%) was the dominant pathogen. The ""alert pathogens"" accounted for 54.7% of all the analyzed strains. The MDR strains represented 72.6% and 9.7% among A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In the years 2011 vs. 2018, an increase in infections with MDR bacilli was observed, 34.6% vs. 61.0% (p = 0.0008), respectively, including A. baumannii MDR 16.54% vs. 34.56 % (p = 0.0009) and Enterobacterales ESBL+/AMPC 11.8% vs. 15.44 % (p = 0.3921). Resistance to methicillin was confirmed in 35.2% of S. aureus strains. Resistance to vancomycin was found among 30.9% of Enterococcus spp. The observed period was marked by an increase in the consumption of carbapenems: 197.7 vs. 235.9 defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patients-days. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be dominant pathogens in healthcare-associated infections. The most frequently cultured pathogens were multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae ESBL(+), and P. aeruginosa. The study showed an increase in the incidence of ""alert pathogens"" and MDR bacilli, as well as the tendency of a growing resistance to antibiotics during the observed period. Microbiological analysis of HAIs and the consumption of antibiotics is the necessary element of the proper antibiotic policy in hospitals."

Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected during a period from September 1984 to March 1985. We first determined types of respiratory diseases and found that, between 1981 and 1983, 57.9 approximately 64.5% of the examined diseases were chronic respiratory infections such as chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, and that these infections including diffuse panbronchiolitis accounted for 63.1% in 1984. Bacterial pneumonia was found to be 24.8% in 1981, but it was 11.0% in 1983 and 15.1% in 1984. These results seemed to reflect decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia in young population. We then investigated the correlations between these infections and isolates and found that distributions of causative organisms of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis during the 4 years were similar while the detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus from bacterial pneumonia increased in 1982 and 1983, and that of Gram-positive organisms such as Enterococcus faecalis rose in 1984. Branhamella catarrhalis was considered to be a non-pathogenic organism normally harbored in the upper respiratory tract. Recently, however, respiratory infections caused by this organism have been reported by some investigators. In our research also, this Gram-negative diplococcus was isolated as a causative organism of respiratory infections as 6 strains were found in 1983 and 29 strains in 1984, hence an increase was observed."

Serious community and nosocomial enterococcal infections involved a variety of sites, and antibiotic resistance was common. Types of infection by major organ system were cardiovascular, 54% (catheter-related bacteremia 28%, primary bacteremia 18%, endocarditis 6%, septic thrombophlebitis 1%); intra-abdominal, 13% (including cholangitis, 6%); renal, 13%; skin and soft tissue, 5%; bone and joint, 4%; pleuropulmonary, 4%; central nervous system, 3%; deep surgical wound, 3%; and endometritis, 2%. Sixty-one percent of infections were nosocomial; 48% of these occurred in the intensive care unit. Enterococcus faecium was responsible for 20% of all infections. Antibiotic resistances among the infections included high-level gentamicin resistance (26%), ampicillin resistance (10%), and vancomycin resistance (8%). Clinical cure was achieved in 64% of patients; 6.8% of patients relapsed, 6.8% had recurrence of the infection with a different pathogen, and overall mortality was 23%. Ampicillin resistance and a high acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score were highly predictive of lack of cure."

During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy."

We examined the clinical features and significance of pathogenic microbes isolated from sputum in patients with lung cancer complicated by pneumonia. Many investigators have noted that patients with squamous cell lung cancer tend to contract pneumonia more readily than patients with cancers of other histopathological types. Our review, however, disclosed no significant differences among histopathological types. Bacteriological examinations of sputum revealed the frequent involvement of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and various gram-negative organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species) that are known to be causative agents of hospital-acquired infection. Beta-lactam and CLDM were less effective. Carbapenem used alone as the second regimen of treatment for lung cancer patients with pneumonia was found to be as effective as combination therapy with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside. However, more detailed investigations (e.g., randomized prospective studies) will be needed to identify suitable antibiotics against pneumonia in patients with lung cancer. We concluded that it will be necessary to evaluate the clinical features and outcome of pneumonia in lung cancer patients in order to provide more effective treatment."

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms.

Despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. However, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. METHODS: To evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between January 2000 and December 2004. For patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. RESULTS: A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). Sixty patients (78.9%) experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. A microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. Pathogens responsible for the infections were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group B Streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable Streptococcus organisms (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Haemophilus spp. (n = 9), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 4). According to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases.

Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality."

A case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. All VREG isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of E. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of E. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. Eleven cases of VREG were identified between May through June 2004. VREG was isolated from blood (N=4), surgical secretions (N=4), paranasal sinus secretion (N=1), lung abscess (N=1) and urine (N=1). Infections with VREG were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. Logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for VREG infection. All isolates were identified as E. gallinarum, harboured the vanC1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by PFGE. Virulence-associated genes were not detected. This is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of VREG and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination."

To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients &gt;or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged &gt;or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged &gt;or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged &gt;or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients."

Although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading Gram-positive species. We evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (North America, 43.0%; Latin America, 11.7%; Europe, 31.3%; and Asia-Pacific, 14.0%) Doripenem Surveillance Program for the years 2003 to 2007. Doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; MIC(90) values, &lt;or=0.06 microg/mL), with no differences noted between geographic regions. Against Enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC(50), 4 microg/mL) but was largely inactive against Enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). Although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the United States, doripenem was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. Doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; MIC(90), &lt;or=0.06 microg/mL, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; MIC(90), 0.25 microg/mL). Doripenem appears broadly active in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens."

All the patients were associated with the following clinical risk factors: previous use of wide spectrum antibiotics (5/5); more than 1 abdominal laparotomy (4/5), due to primary failure of the graft (3/4) and thrombosis of the hepatic artery (1/4). Two of the three patients [corrected] with invasive candidiasis had previous episodes of documented fungemia. 24 patients of the group who didn't show MIP had some risk factor which in all of them was the previous use of high dose steroids and/or of wide spectrum antibiotics, in addition to the used in surgical prophylaxis. In our series, the one risk factor associated with MIP was more than one previous laparotomy (p less than 0.001). Other significant associated infections were 3 bacterial sepsis (2 due to Enterococcus faecalis and 1 due to Staphylococcus epidermidis) and one viral (Cytomegalovirus viremia).

The strains were consecutively collected (one per patient) between January 2005 and September 2008 and susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods at the JMI Laboratories (North Liberty, Iowa, USA). A total of 3,907 Gram-positive cocci were analyzed. The Gram-positive organisms most frequently isolated from bloodstream infections were Staphylococcus aureus (2,218 strains; 20.2% of total), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 812 strains [14.7%]), and Enterococcus spp. (754 strains; 5.0%). S. aureus ranked first (28.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis ranked 7th (4.5%) among cases of skin and soft tissue infections. S. aureus was also the second most frequently isolated pathogen from patients with lower respiratory tract infections (24.9% of cases) after Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.5%). Resistance to oxacillin was observed in 31.0% of S. aureus and the vast majority of oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) strains were also resistant to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin were all very active against S. aureus strains tested (&gt;99.9-100.0% susceptible), but daptomycin (MIC(50), 0.25 g/mL and MIC(90), 0.5 g/mL) was four- to eight-fold more potent than vancomycin (MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 1 g/mL) and linezolid (MIC(50), 1 g/mL and MIC(90), 2 g/mL). Vancomycin resistance increased significantly among enterococci during the study period, but it was restrict to only one medical center until 2007 and emerged in a second medical center in 2008. Daptomycin was the most active antimicrobial tested against enterococci in general (100.0% susceptible), followed by linezolid (99.9% susceptible), ampicillin (87.4%) and vancomycin (84.6%). In conclusion, daptomycin and linezolid showed excellent in vitro activity against contemporary Gram-positive organisms (3,907) collected in Brazilian hospitals monitored by the SENTRY Program, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and other multi-drug-resistant organisms. Although vancomycin resistance rates in Brazil appears to be relatively low compared to those reported in the USA, VRE has emerged and rapidly disseminated in some Brazilian medical centers."

We reported a case of mediastinal abscess due to Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) accompanied with SVC syndrome and reviewed the literature on this particular condition. A 38-year-old female with swelling of the neck and dilatation of cervical vein was admitted to our hospital, being diagnosed as having a SVC syndrome. Chest roentgenogram revealed an enlargement of the right upper mediastinum and a massive infiltration in the right upper lung field. CT scan demonstrated a mass with central necrosis occupying the right upper mediastinum and stenosis of superior vena cava. Further conformation of the stenosis of vena cava was made by means of venography. E. faecalis was recovered from the pus aspirated from the mediastinal abscess, and a definitive diagnosis of SVC syndrome caused by mediastinal abscess due to E. faecalis was made. There has been no report, to our knowledge, on mediastinal abscess evolving SVC syndrome in which E. faecalis was identified as a causative organism. The present case indicates that a benign disease such as lung abscess should be considered to be a possible cause of SVC syndrome in addition to other frequent malignant diseases."

The large intestine was not examined in most patients. Five patients (7%) had associated colonic carcinoma, and 17 patients (25%) had colorectal diseases. Only 7/68 patients (10%) were clinically diagnosed as having infective endocarditis by the doctors in charge. The others were regarded as having septicemia. The charts of these patients were reviewed retrospectively to diagnose infective endocarditis based on strict definitions. One (1%) had definite endocarditis proved at autopsy. 16 patients (24%) had probable endocarditis due to the presence of either a new regurgitant murmur or both a predisposing heart disease and embolic phenomena; 39 (57%) had possible endocarditis based on evidence of having either a predisposing heart disease or embolic phenomena; and only 12 (18%) had no evidence of endocarditis. 27 patients (40%) had at least one predisposing heart disease associated with endocarditis. 51 patients (75%) had at least one lesion suggesting embolic phenomena. 30 patients (44%) had electrocardiographic abnormalities. This high incidence of arrhythmia in nonenterococcal septicemia is of particular interest and could be related to cardiac involvement in some patients. The overall mortality, 62% (42/68), was extremely high in our series, but in those who were clinically diagnosed and treated as infective endocarditis, the mortality was low, 14% (1/7). We suggest all patients with nonenterococcal septicemia associated with either heart disease or lesions of CNS, lung, heart, kidney or limbs suggesting embolic phenomena should be regarded as having possible or probable endocarditis. Treating such patients as having infective endocarditis may reduce the mortality in nonenterococcal septicemia."

This demand renders recipients more sensitive to infections. As pulmonary infections are a major clinical problem during the first postoperative year after lung transplantation, preventive treatment and regular surveillance examinations are needed for immediate, adequate therapy. We describe the airway pathogens registered during the first posttransplantation year among our 12 lung transplant recipients since December 2008. Samples were obtained for microbiologic analysis from the upper and lower respiratory tracts and from serum as part of routine care. During the first year after transplantation the most frequent pathogens were fungi (Candida albicans 82%; Aspergillus 50%), Pneumocystis (8%), gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas spp 60%; Klebsiella 25%, Acinetobacter 17%; Escherichia Coli 17%; and Enterococcus faecalis 25%), and Staphylococcus aureus (50%, including methicillin-resistant strains 25%).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 309 adults with DHF, 10 fatal patients and 299 survivors (controls) were retrospectively analyzed. Regarding causes of fatality, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was found in 4 patients, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone in 2; DSS/subarachnoid hemorrhage, Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia, ventilator associated pneumonia, and massive GI bleeding/Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia each in one. Fatal patients were found to have significantly higher frequencies of early altered consciousness (&lt;=24 h after hospitalization), hypothermia, GI bleeding/massive GI bleeding, DSS, concurrent bacteremia with/without shock, pulmonary edema, renal/hepatic failure, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among those experienced early altered consciousness, massive GI bleeding alone/with uremia/with E. faecalis bacteremia, and K. pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia were each found in one patient. Significantly higher proportion of bandemia from initial (arrival) laboratory data in fatal patients as compared to controls, and higher proportion of pre-fatal leukocytosis and lower pre-fatal platelet count as compared to initial laboratory data of fatal patients were found. Massive GI bleeding (33.3%) and bacteremia (25%) were the major causes of pre-fatal leukocytosis in the deceased patients; 33.3% of the patients with pre-fatal profound thrombocytopenia (&lt;20,000/microL), and 50% of the patients with pre-fatal prothrombin time (PT) prolongation experienced massive GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights causes of fatality other than DSS in patients with severe dengue, and suggested hypothermia, leukocytosis and bandemia may be warning signs of severe dengue. Clinicians should be alert to the potential development of massive GI bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and/or leukocytosis. Antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and leukocytosis."

DESIGN AND SETTING: Comparison of data from LTACHs and from medical and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) in short-stay acute care hospitals reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) during 2010. METHODS: Rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well as device utilization ratios were calculated. For each HAI, pathogen profiles and antimicrobial resistance prevalence were evaluated. Comparisons were made using Poisson regression and the mood median and chi2 tests. RESULTS: In 2010, 104 LTACHs reported CLABSIs and 57 reported CAUTIs and VAP to the NHSN. Median CLABSI rates in LTACHs (1.25 events per 1,000 device-days reported; range, 0.0-5.96) were comparable to rates in major teaching ICUs and were higher than those in other ICUs. CAUTI rates in LTACHs (median, 2.61; range, 0.0-9.92) were higher and VAP rates (median, 0.0; range, 0.0-3.29) were generally lower than those in ICUs. Central line utilization in LTACHs was higher than that in ICUs, whereas urinary catheter and ventilator utilization was lower. Methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus CLABSIs (83%) and vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecalis CAUTIs (44%) were higher in LTACHs than in ICUs. Multidrug resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa CAUTIs (25%) was higher in LTACHs than in most ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: CLABSIs and CAUTIs associated with multidrug-resistant organisms present a challenge in LTACHs. Continued HAI surveillance with pathogen-level data can guide prevention efforts in LTACHs."

METHODS: Thirty one years (1980-2011) of cases of CDE were analyzed retrospectively and compared to overall insertion data; the clinical course and management strategies of these patients have been reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 23 cases (16 male, median age 72 years) were identified, 20 of these cases were determined at our institution where 5287 procedures were performed (endocarditis rate 0.38%). Thirteen patients were determined to have a cardiac device pocket infection. Infection in 7 cases (30%) was caused by lead(s). However, in 16 cases (70%) both leads and the pocket of devices were the reason of infection. Median time was 13.5 months for presentation. Patients who had undergone the last procedure within 6 months were admitted earlier than those with longer post procedure time (p&lt;0.05). Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated lead vegetations in 13 of the 16 cases (81%). Organisms were identified in 18 cases (78%)-78% Staphylococci (56% Staphylococcus aureus). Leads of the device were removed in 17 cases (74%); seven cases by percutaneous simple traction and 10 cases by sternotomy.

These are generally considered to be safe. The incidence of major complications with their use is low, but could be life threatening. Complications can be divided into those encountered during placement, removal, or retention of temporary epicardial pacing wires. We report a rare case of prosthetic mitral valve endocarditis caused by TEPWs that migrated into the pulmonary artery, presenting 5 months following mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery that required percutaneous removal of these temporary pacing wires via a right femoral vein approach. This case highlights the fact that delayed complications can rarely occur due to retained TEPWs and may have serious consequences. This fact should be taken into account when the strategy on dealing with such wires following cardiac surgery is determined. Routine retention of temporary epicardial pacing wires is not recommended.

METHODS: A total of 41 severe intra-abdominal infected patients with abdominal trauma were recruited to collect 123 abdominal pus specimens. And the results of laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were analyzed with the WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 297 strains of bacteria were isolated at (7.2 +- 2.3) strains for each patient. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 44.1% (131/297) , Gram-negative bacteria 55.2% (164/297) and fungi 0.7% (2/297). The top five isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Those antibiotics highly sensitive (&gt;90%) to Escherichia coli included cefoperazone (91%), imipenem (98%); highly sensitive to Gram-positive cocci included teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to vancomycin. The agents with a high susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumonia included imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). Ciprofloxacin (90%) had the highest sensitivity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant bacteria of causing severe intra-abdominal infection of traumatic patients is Gram-negative bacteria, but the infection of Gram-positive bacteria, especially the ratio of Staphylococcus aureus infection is also comparatively high. Cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid have higher antibacterial activity."

METHODS: a total of 1,157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from January 2010 to December 2012 in the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were identified to species level with a VITEK-2 COMPACT fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus species was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of Enterococcus species from the burns department. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and the changes in the MIC of Enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment were evaluated. The beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emeA genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: the 1,157 clinical isolates of Enterococcus species included 679 E. faecium isolates (58.7%), 382 E. faecalis isolates (33%), 26 E. casseliflavus isolates (2.2%), 24 E. avium isolates (2.1%), and 46 isolates of other Enterococcus species (4%). The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between E. faecium and E. faecalis, and &lt;= 1.1% of these two Enterococcus species were found to be resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. In addition, the Enterococcus species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of Enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. The beta-lactamase gene TEM, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes aac(6')-aph(2""), aph(3')-III, ant(6)-I and ant(2"")-I, tetracycline resistance gene tetM, erythromycin resistance gene ermB, vancomycin resistance gene vanA and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emeA gene were detected in 77%, 62%, 26%, 13%, 36%, 31%, 66%, 5% and 55% of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. CONCLUSIONS: similar to previous findings, E. faecium and E. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. Multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent in the hospital isolates of Enterococcus species. Reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of Enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the MIC of Enterococcus species to these three fluoroquinolones. The presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emeA gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in Enterococcus species. The monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections."

The spectrum of the microrganisms is different according to regions, countries and periods of time. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment improve the outcome. However dissociation often occurs between clinical manifestation, laboratory and microbiological findings. AIMS: To determine the incidence of neonatal bacteremia in our hospital, to identify the spectrum of organisms from positive blood cultures (BC), to analyze the correlation between clinical manifestation of EOS and/or laboratory abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out at the University Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology ""Maichin dom""- Sofia for 2012. From all 4081 inborn babies 848 were at risk for maternal-fetal infection. In the first two hours after birth they were screened for EONS using a panel of microbiological probes and laboratory blood tests, followed up the next days. According the guidelines of the Neonatology clinic a standard antibiotic therapy was started. 43 of the screened infants (1.05% of all inborn babies) had positive BC and were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: Sixteen from the 43 babies with positive BC were with birthweight &gt; 2500g (0.48% from all 3316 life born term infants), 27--with birthweight &lt; 2500g (3.5% from all 765 low birthweight babies), 24 were patients of the NICU (3.8% of all 635 babies admitted at the NICU for 2012). No one died. The following groups of organisms in BC were isolated: 24 BC with coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Methicilline sensitive (MSCoNS)--11 of them without any clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were interpreted as result of contamination, 1 BC with Staphylococcus aureus MS (MSSA), 8 with alpha-Streptococci, 5 with Enterococcus faecalis (1 in combination with MSCoNS), 2 with GBS, 2 with Aerococcus urinae and 2 BC with Listeria monocytogenes. Gram-negative organisms were not found in BC after birth. 30 from the infants with positive BC didn't show any clinical symptom of EONS. 20 of them were without laboratory criteria for infection and were discharged after negative BC control. 10 newborns were with transient elevation of CRP but without clinical symptoms. 13 babies showed clinical symptoms of EOS, 3 of them had transient respiratory failure, but negative laboratory criteria. 10 babies met the clinical and laboratory criteria for EONS; in 8 of them the CRP was significantly elevated. Most critically ill were 3 ELBW and ELGA babies: 2 twins with Listeria and 1 baby with MSSA-EONS. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, CoNS were found to be the most common cause of EONS or bacteremia, low incidence of GBS sepsis was established. Almost the half of the babies with positive BC were asymptomatic and without laboratory data for infection. Elevation of the CRP-value was the most frequent laboratory abnormality in symptomatic infants."

However, the colonization characteristics of Enterococcus with LZD resistance in patients remain elusive. Here, we report the case of a patient with recurrent pneumonia due to infection with LZD-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strains. The colonization characteristics of the strains isolated from this patient were analyzed. METHODS: Ten E. faecalis strains were isolated from tracheal secretions obtained from the patient during five recurrences of pneumonia over the course of 10 months. Clonal relationships were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI-macrorestricted genomic DNA. The susceptibility of the isolates to LZD was determined by Etest in Mueller-Hinton agar. RESULTS: The homology of these strains was demonstrated by PFGE, suggesting that occult bacterial colonization by LZD-resistant E. faecalis is possible as late as a year after exposure to LZD. These strains showed variable MICs as determined by the Etest. LZD-resistant isolates contained single or double nucleotide mutations in domain V of 23S rRNA as confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sensitivity of the strains to vancomycin was demonstrated by broth macrodilution, and vancomycin was an effective clinical treatment on each occasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LZD-resistant E. faecalis strains may colonize persistently in vivo, leading to recurrent infection."

Formation of biofilm and production of DNase, hemolysin, lipase, and gelatinase were characterized. Biofilms of selected strains were examined for their susceptibility to antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). METHODS: All strains were tested for biofilm production by microtiter method and the activity of hemolysin, gelatinase, lipase, and DNase by plate method with an adequate substrate. Photodynamic therapy with Photolon and red laser light was performed towards 48 h biofilms of eight representative strains. The viability of biofilms was tested by the BactLight assay and visualized under a fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: Among the 400 isolates, 69.8% strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 30% of Enterococcus faecium, and 0.2% of Enterococcus casseliflavus were identified. In vitro, production of biofilm was found in 65.7% of enterococci. Biofilm-positive strains were isolated from urinary tract infections (81%), wound infections (71%), respiratory tract infections (62%), and gastrointestinal tract (47%) (colonization). Hemolysin activity was observed in 28.5%, gelatinase in 24.5%, lipase in 23%, and DNase in 3.5% of all, mostly biofilm-positive, isolates. Photodynamic therapy with Photolon efficiently reduced the enterococcal biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the high prevalence of biofilm-producing clinical enterococci, their virulence potential being higher than for biofilm-negative strains, and the susceptibility to aPDT of mature biofilms produced by strains, regardless of their species and site of isolation."

Clinical presentation is nonspecific. Pulmonary embolism may present initially similar to bacterial endocarditis of the right heart, septic thrombophlebitis, or osteomyelitis. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who had dyspnea over the four months before consultation, complicated three months later by hemoptysis. She was diagnosed with subacute bacterial endocarditis secondary to group D Streptococcus, developed upon a ventricular septal defect. Two weeks later, the child had sudden chest pain and tachypnea. Lung scintigraphy showed multiple pulmonary embolisms. The therapeutic approach was to continue antibiotics without anticoagulant treatment. The outcome was favorable with apyrexia and stabilization on the respiratory level. Pulmonary embolism is a rare disease in children with an incidence of 3.7%. Classically, it presents with fever, hemoptysis, and nonspecific infiltrates on chest X-ray. These signs were noted in our patient, although the infiltrates on the chest X-ray were hidden by the pulmonary edema associated with heart failure. The persistence of these left basal opacities after antidiuretic treatment suggested an infectious origin. Subsequently, lung scintigraphy showed that it was a pulmonary infarct. The therapy of septic pulmonary embolism is the same as that for infective endocarditis. Antibiotic treatment alone was maintained without anticoagulants because of the high risk of bleeding at the seat of the pulmonary embolism and the insubstantial significant benefit of this therapy. Pulmonary embolism in children is a rare disease, but its incidence is underestimated. Better knowledge on its actual impact and etiologies in children is necessary. Multicenter studies are needed to establish recommendations. "

Published data are limited to a few case series and reports. We sought to review the Mayo Clinic experience and describe clinical, echocardiographic, and microbiologic features. We included all patients aged &gt;=18 years seen from 2000 to 2014 who had a diagnosis of native PV IE and unequivocal echocardiographic involvement of the PV. Nine patients with PV IE were identified. Isolated PV IE was present in 7 (78%) of 9 cases. The median age was 59 years and 22% were women. Three patients had congenital heart disease, 2 had central venous catheters, and 3 had cardiovascular implantable electronic devices. Five patients (56%) received chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Enterococcus faecalis and viridans group streptococci were the most common pathogens, isolated in 22% of cases each. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) were done in 6 and 7 patients, respectively. Four patients underwent both procedures. TTE was diagnostic in all cases, but TEE failed to detect PV involvement in 1 patient. Median follow-up was 1.8 years. Five patients (56%) underwent PV replacement. There were no operative deaths. One patient had sudden death during follow-up, unrelated to his PV IE episode. Our results suggest that PV IE is rare but carries significant morbidity. TTE and TEE provide complementary information with TEE providing better visualization of other cardiac structures. Our findings of a high prevalence of immunosuppressive therapy and cardiovascular implantable electronic devices have not been previously reported and deserve further investigation."

The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and microbiological features of bacteremia caused by E. faecalis. METHODOLOGY: Between 2011 and 2013, significant bacteremia caused by E. faecalis in hospitalized patients was studied. Patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, and 14-day mortality were recorded. Virulence genes esp, gelE, and cylA; opsonophagocytosis resistance; resistance to bactericidal effect of normal serum; beta lactamase production; and susceptibility to ampicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, gentamicin, and streptomycin were investigated. RESULTS: E. faecalis strains were recovered from 33 bacteremic patients. Polymicrobial bacteremia was diagnosed in 2 patients; 10 patients died. Virulence genes were found in strains from both deceased patients and survivors. Sources of bacteremia included urinary tract infections (36.4%), vascular catheters (15.1%), abscesses (9.1%), and unknown (48.5%). Underlying diseases included cancer (30.3%), diabetes (36.4%), cirrhosis (6.1%), renal (36.4%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.0%). Co-morbidities included alcohol use (26.1%); glucocorticoid therapy (19.0%); prior antibiotic therapy (60.6%); and central venous (21.2%), arterial (12.1%), and urinary (63.6%) catheters. Also, 57.6% of patients came from the intensive care unit (ICU); 33.3% had mechanical ventilation. Significant mortality-associated conditions included polymicrobial bacteremia, oncological disease, APACHE II score &lt;= 20, ICU stay, renal disease, central venous catheter, and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome of patients was associated with their status and not with the presence of virulence genes in E. faecalis strains. A significant percentage of bacteremia had undetermined origin.

METHODS: The Dutch Surveillance System on Antibiotic Resistance was used to determine monthly rates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates, including resistant phenotypes, in blood and respiratory tract specimens from 2008 to 2013. Per patient, the last isolate per species per month was selected, and cumulative rates per 100 beds per month were determined. Time trends were analysed by multilevel Poisson regression. RESULTS: Eighteen ICUs used SOD/SDD (1296 months), 13 did not use SOD/SDD (936 months) and 11 introduced SOD/SDD (373 months before and 419 months after introduction). There was no significant increase in the rate of Gram-positive cocci in ICUs that used SOD/SDD. Introduction of SOD/SDD was associated with increased rates of S. aureus (beta = 0.018, 95% CI 0.006-0.030) and E. faecalis isolates (beta = 0.028, 95% CI 0.006-0.051) in respiratory tract specimens. Numbers of resistant phenotypes remained low, and an observed increase in E. faecium isolates (beta = 0.033, 95% CI 0.012-0.054), 97% of which were resistant to ampicillin, in the absence of SOD/SDD disappeared after the introduction of SOD/SDD. CONCLUSIONS: In ICUs with a low endemicity of resistance, introduction of SOD/SDD was associated with increased rates of S. aureus and E. faecalis isolates, but not with resistant phenotypes. Continuous 5 year use of SOD/SDD was not associated with increased isolation of Gram-positive cocci."

METHODS: A total of 3849 Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus strains were isolated from Southern China during 2001-2015. Bacteria identification was performed by colony morphology, Gram staining, the API commercial kit and the Vitek 2 automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by disk diffusion method and MIC method. RESULTS: As sampling site was concerned, 51.4% of Staphylococcus strains were isolated from sputum, whereas urinary tract remained the dominant infection site among Enterococcus and Streptococcus. According to the antimicrobial susceptibility, three genus of important Gram-positive pathogens showed high resistance against erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. Resistance rates to penicillins (penicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin) were high as well, with the exception of E. faecalis and Streptococcus. Overall, resistance rates against methicillin (oxacillin) were 63.2% in S. aureus and 76.2% in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), along with continuous increases during the study. VRSA and vancomycin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus only appeared in 2011-2015. Sight decline was obtained for the vancomycin resistance of E. faecalis, while vancomycin-resistant E. faecium only appeared in 2011-2015, with its intermediate rate decreasing. Significant decrease in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (PRSP) was observed during studied period. Glycopeptide antibiotic remained highly effective to Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus (resistance rates &lt;5%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite decline obtained for some antibiotic agents resistance during 2001-2015, antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens still remained high in Southern China. This study may aid in the guidance for appropriate therapeutic strategy of infections caused by nosocomial pathogens."

Fever symptoms and prodromal infections have been reported in many cases, but still not been elucidated. METHODS: Our study enrolled 140 consecutive patients with anti-GBM disease and retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of fever symptoms and the possible reasons. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients, 94 (67.1%) patients presented with fever (over 37.5 C) prior to admission or within 48 h of hospitalization. Among those with fever, 74 (78.7%) patients had infections, 15 (16.0%) patients had positive serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, all towards myeloperoxidase, which was comparable to the patients without fever (17.4%, P = 0.830). There were 93/140 patients suffered from infections, with 47.3% in lungs and 31.2% on upper respiratory tract. In some cases, we identified the microbes of infections, including Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Hemolytic staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter braakii. Patients with fever had higher levels of serum anti-GBM antibodies (154.9 +- 58.4 vs. 106.0 +- 63.2 IU/mL, P &lt; 0.001), higher serum creatinine (733.4 +- 402.5 vs. 580.6 +- 368.1 mumol/L, P = 0.032), higher percentage of crescents (87.0 +- 15.6 vs. 67.4 +- 37.6%, P = 0.021), and higher frequency of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) (80.9% vs. 60.9%, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: We concluded that fever is a common symptom in anti-GBM disease and associates with more severe glomerulonephritis. The majority of patients at presentation had fever with respiratory tract infections, which needs further investigation to reveal their role in the pathogenesis of anti-GBM disease."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on blood culture tests obtained from patients in a pediatric intensive care unit and sent to a microbiology laboratory between 2013 and 2016. The species and antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed in microorganisms isolated from the blood cultures. RESULTS: Overall, 4239 blood cultures were obtained. Growth was detected in 324 blood cultures (7.6%). Of the microorganisms isolated, 195 (60.2%) were Gram-positive bacteria, and 107 (33.0%) were Gram-negative bacteria; 22 (6.8%) were fungi. The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Coagulase-negative staphylococci (45.1%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (14.5%), and Enterococcus faecalis (6.5%). Among the fungi, the most common was Candida albicans (59.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis. The resistance rate against methicillin was 89.9% in coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 66% in S. aureus strains. The resistance rate against vancomycin was 3.6% in Enterococci spp. There was no resistance against linezolid in Gram-positive microorganisms. The rate of extended-spectrum beta lactamase positivity was found as 34% in Klebsiella spp. and 100% in Escherichia coli. The resistance rate against carbapenem was 44.9% in Gram-negative bacteriae. The resistance rate against carbapenem was 100% in Acinetobacter baumanii. In Candida albicans, resistance to amphotericine B was 61.5%, and resistance to voriconazole was 7.7%. CONCLUSIONS: To plan effective empiric antibiotic therapy against nosocomial infections in intensive care units, all units should have information about the characteristics of their own flora."

The possibility of infecting a sick person in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is many times greater than in other hospital departments OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the epidemiological indicators and to determine the clinical types of HAI that are present in the ICU during the 5-year period in the St. Lukas District Hospital in Tarnow MATERIALS AND METHODS: HAI has been detected and documented in patients in ICU in the years 2012-2016 by the use of the active monitoring method. We studied patients who spent over 2 days in ICU with a general profile. These studies were conducted in accordance with the methodology recommended by Healthcare-Associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) RESULTS: Among 886 patients who were hospitalized for a total of 6711 days, HAI was diagnosed in 195 patients (22.0% incidence rate), the incidence density rate was 29.1 per 1000 person-days of hospitalization. The rate for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) was 12.5 per 1000 ventilator days, for Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CA-BSI) the rate was 8.2 per 1000 central line days, for Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CA-UTI) the rate was 3.3 per 1000 urinary catheter days. The average duration of a patient stay in ICU was 24 days (19 days for patients without HAI and 43 days for patients with HAI). The following microorganisms isolated from HAI were prevailing: Acinetobacter baumannii 46 (27%), Staphylococcus aureus 12 (21%), Enterococcus faecalis 17 (10%) CONCLUSIONS: A five-year HAI study in ICU showed that the most common types of infections were bloodstream infections and pneumonia. The incidence rate of VAP remained at similar levels in subsequent years. The CA-BSI rates were reduced over the next three years of the study, but their rise in the last year can prove the lack of stability of the preventive actions. CA-UTI was detected twice less frequently, which can suggest poor detection of this type of infection"

Cases included all patients who developed a healthcare-associated infection (HAI) with Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, or Enterococcus faecium. Controls were uninfected patients matched by fiscal quarter, hospital, and length of stay. For each bed occupied during the 3-5-day period prior to infection, microbiology results for assigned roommates and the patient who occupied the bed immediately prior to the case were collected. For controls, the day of infection of the matched case served as the reference point.RESULTSIn total, 10,289 HAIs were identified. In a multivariable analysis controlling for both exposures and patient characteristics, the odds of cases having been exposed to a prior bed occupant with the same organism were 5.83 times that of controls (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.62-9.39), and the odds of cases having been exposed to a roommate with the same organism were 4.82 times that of controls (95% CI, 3.67-6.34).CONCLUSIONInfected or colonized roommates and prior occupants do pose a risk, which may warrant enhanced terminal and intermittent cleaning measures.Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2018;39:541-546."

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and etiological agents of HAI in a Surgical ICU in Kazakhstan, and to assess the impact of these infections on ICU stay and mortality. Objective: To assess the rate of device-associated infections and causative HAI etiological agents in an ICU at the National Research Center for Oncology and Transplantation (NRCOT) in Astana, Kazakhstan. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a 12-bed ICU at the NRCOT, Astana, Kazakhstan. We enrolled all patients who were admitted to the ICU from January, 2014 through November 2015, aged 18 to 90 years of age who developed an HAI. Results: The most common type of HAI was surgical site infection (SSI), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related blood stream infection (BSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI). The most common HAI was SSI with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most common etiological agent. The second most common HAI was VAP also with P. aeruginosa followed by BSI which was also associated with P. aeruginosa (in 2014) and Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (in 2015) as the most common etiological agents causing these infections. Conclusion: We found that HAI among our study population were predominantly caused by gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the only study that describes ICU-related HAI situation from a country within the Central Asian region. Many developing countries such as Kazakhstan lack surveillance systems which could effectively decrease incidence of HAIs and healthcare costs for their treatment. The epidemiological data on HAI in Kazakhstan currently is underrepresented and poorly reported in the literature. Based on this and previous studies, we propose that the most important interventions to prevent HAI at the NRCOT and similar Healthcare Institutions in Kazakhstan are active surveillance, regular infection control audits, rational and effective antibacterial therapy, and general hygiene measures."

The pattern of organisms causing infections varies between different countries and hospitals; therefore it is important that every hospital generates antibiograms to guide healthcare professionals during treatment with optimal choice of antibiotics. Our study aimed to described the pattern of fungal and bacterial pathogen in patients with high risk for invasive fungal disease (IFD). Methods: An observational study was conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, within March-September 2015. Specimens were taken from blood, sputum, endotracheal aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), urine, pus and drainage fluid/surgical tissue specimen on 5th-7th day of hospitalization. Samples were cultured onto suitable culture media and bacterial isolates were identified using standard biochemical methods. Results: Bacteria and Candida sp. were isolated from 153 patients. C. tropicalis (44.31%) was the commonest fungal isolated. Incidence of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria. Klebsiella pneumonia was the most common gram-negative bacteria isolated, where as Enterococcus faecalis for gram-positive bacteria.

However, making the correct diagnosis is rather difficult because the clinical presentation and findings of blood tests are non-specific. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old female complaining of dyspnea for 5 days with acute mitral regurgitation was transferred to our hospital. She had acute heart and respiratory failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Although infective endocarditis was suspected, repeated blood cultures and transesophageal echocardiography could not reveal any findings of infective endocarditis. Because the etiology of her condition was not determined by various examinations, mitral annuloplasty was required to treat her mitral regurgitation, and was performed for definitive diagnosis and treatment revealing the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve. Enterococcus faecalis was detected by cultures of the mitral valve and blood after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS It can be very difficult to diagnose infective endocarditis correctly, especially when a case fails to fulfill the modified Duke criteria. In such a case, only cardiac surgery might enable us to make an accurate diagnosis and save a patient's life."

Patients and methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients from the Chinese Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections (CARES) program between 2007 and 2016. Data on the clinicopathological factors and causative pathogens were collected. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) interpretive breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2017. Results: A total of 2,756 patients were included. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 9.5% (262/2,756). Multivariable analysis showed that the following independent risk factors were associated with the 30-day mortality: age &gt;60 years, pulmonary disease, tracheal cannula, infection occurring in intensive care unit (ICU), prior admission within 3 months, antibiotic use before infection, recent use of immunosuppressants, and multidrug-resistant organisms. In addition, 2,913 clinical isolates were collected. The Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 70.8% and 29.2% of all isolates, respectively. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (33.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.8%), and Enterococcus faecium (10.7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative pathogens. E. faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common Gram-positive pathogens. E. coli, A. baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae were more commonly found in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. Overall, the antibiotics tested in the CARES exhibited diminished susceptibility to pathogens over the study period, especially extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing isolates. Conclusion: Considering the current data set and high-level resistance of intra-abdominal pathogens to various antibiotics, further monitoring of the epidemiology of IAIs and their susceptibility to antibiotics through the CARES is warranted."

Methods: This study included 293 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. We compared the pathological bacteria that were detected in bacteriological cultures of sputum, mouthwash and gastric fluid on the second postoperative day with the pathogenic bacteria responsible for postoperative pneumonia. Results: Postoperative pneumonia occurred in 26 (8.8%) of the 293 patients. Enterobacter cloacae was detected most frequently in the perioperative bacteriological culture, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Detection of each pathogenic bacterium in the perioperative bacteriological culture was not associated with the occurrence of pneumonia, excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As the pathogens responsible for postoperative pneumonia, 32 bacteria were detected in 26 patients with postoperative pneumonia. Detection rate of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for postoperative pneumonia in a perioperative bacteriological culture was 43.8% in a sputum culture, 40.6% in a mouthwash culture and 65.6% in a gastric fluid culture. The detection rate of the pathogenic bacteria responsible for pneumonia was up to 78.1% in the combination of sputum and gastric fluid culture. Conclusions: Although the perioperative bacteriological culture does not seem to be useful for predicting the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia, it is useful for predicting the pathogenic bacteria responsible for pneumonia in cases of postoperative pneumonia. The perioperative bacteriological culture helps us to select appropriate antibiotics to treat pneumonia after esophagectomy."

Strongyloides has a unique auto-infective lifecycle such that it can persist in the human host for decades. In immunosuppressed patients, especially those on corticosteroids, potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis can occur, often with concurrent secondary infections. Herein, we present two immunocompromised patients with severe strongyloidiasis who presented with pneumonia, hemoptysis, and sepsis. Both patients were immigrants from developing countries and had received prolonged courses of corticosteroids prior to admission. Patient 1 also presented with a diffuse abdominal rash; a skin biopsy showed multiple intradermal Strongyloides larvae. Patient 1 had concurrent pneumonic nocardiosis and bacteremia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Patient 2 had concurrent Aspergillus and Candida pneumonia and developed an Aerococcus meningitis. Both patients had negative serologic tests for Strongyloides; patient 2 manifested intermittent eosinophilia. In both patients, the diagnosis was afforded by bronchoscopy with lavage. The patients were successfully treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and ivermectin. Patient 1 also received albendazole. Strongyloidiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemoptysis in immunocompromised patients with possible prior exposure to S. stercoralis."

The owner treated the dogs with an intravenous injection of Shuang-Huang-lian, a traditional Chinese medicine, and azithromycin. The respiratory signs improved 3 days post-treatment, however, cysts were observed in the necks of eight dogs, and three of them died in the following 2 days. CASE PRESENTATION: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect canine influenza virus (CIV). All of the dogs in this kennel were positive and the remaining 14 dogs had seroconverted. Two of the dogs were taken to the China Agricultural University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for further examination. Two strains of influenza virus (A/canine/Beijing/0512-133/2017 and A/canine/Beijing/0512-137/2017) isolated from the nasal swabs of these dogs were sequenced and identified as avian-origin H3N2 CIV. For the two dogs admitted to the hospital, hematology showed mild inflammation and radiograph results indicated pneumonia. Cyst fluid was plated for bacterial culture and bacterial 16 s rRNA gene PCR was performed, followed by Sanger sequencing. The results indicated an Enterococcus faecalis infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed and dogs were treated with enrofloxacin. All 14 remaining dogs recovered within 16 days. CONCLUSIONS: Coinfection of H3N2 CIV and Enterococcus faecalis was detected in dogs, which has not been reported previously.

There have been rare case reports in previously healthy children and rarer are the cases with double etiology. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female Caucasian patient, aged 1 year and 8 months, who developed severe sepsis during flu evolution with predominant respiratory and cerebral manifestations. On admission, at skin level, there was noticed a necrotic coccygeal ulceration (with rapid increasing dimensions 0.5/0.5 cm in 24 hours), and with the transformation from a dry necrosis in a sphacelus at the periphery and progression of necrosis in depth. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with ecthyma gangrenosum from which Pseudomonsa aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from the samples that were harvested intraoperatively, decision that was taken considering the appearance of CT scan and the extremely rapid expansion of necrosis. Excisional debridement with necrectomy, lavage, and dressing being performed. The invasion of the fascia was excluded intraoperatively. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with Meropenem for 14 days was initiated, as well as amikacin and linezolid, the latter being replaced with teicoplanin for 14 days. Red blood cells transfusion, intravenous immunoglobulins, anticonvulsants were also administered. OUTCOMES: Under treatment the evolution was favorable.

METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients from 35 Spanish centers from 2008 to 2016. Characteristics and outcomes of 516 cases of EE were compared with those of 3,308 cases of nonenterococcal endocarditis (NEE). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were performed to investigate risk factors for in-hospital and 1-year mortality, as well as relapses. RESULTS: Patients with EE were significantly older; more frequently presented chronic lung disease, chronic heart failure, prior endocarditis, and degenerative valve disease; and had higher median age-adjusted Charlson score. EE more frequently involved the aortic valve and prosthesis (64.3% vs. 46.7%; p &lt; 0.001; and 35.9% vs. 28.9%; p = 0.002, respectively) but less frequently pacemakers/defibrillators (1.5% vs. 10.5%; p &lt; 0.001), and showed higher rates of acute heart failure (45% vs. 38.3%; p = 0.005). Cardiac surgery was less frequently performed in EE (40.7% vs. 45.9%; p = 0.024). No differences in in-hospital and 1-year mortality were found, whereas relapses were significantly higher in EE (3.5% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.035). Increasing Charlson score, LogEuroSCORE, acute heart failure, septic shock, and paravalvular complications were risk factors for mortality, whereas prior endocarditis was protective and persistent bacteremia constituted the sole risk factor for relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Besides other baseline and clinical differences, EE more frequently affects prosthetic valves and less frequently pacemakers/defibrillators. EE presents higher rates of relapse than NEE."

The authors present the case of a previously healthy male adolescent, with complaints of fatigue and chest pain, who was diagnosed with Enterococcus faecalis-associated acute primary lung abscess. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 17-year old boy was admitted to the pediatric ward due to a one-week history of fatigue, inspiratory left side chest pain, dry cough and nasal obstruction. On admission at the emergency department, he was afebrile, with no signs of respiratory distress, but with diminished breath sounds on the left side. A chest x-ray showed a round opacity on the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe; he was discharged with oral amoxicillin 1000 mg three times a day with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Due to the worsening of the productive cough with purulent stinking sputum he was re-evaluated after 4 days. Laboratory studies showed a leukocyte count of 15200/uL and a c-reactive protein of 172 mg/l. The chest computed tomography scan was suggestive of a consolidation of the left lower lobe base and a central abscess. An intravenous course of ceftriaxone and clindamycin was initiated, with a favourable clinical evolution. The bronchofibroscopy performed on day four after his admission revealed the presence of a tracheal bronchus and numerous purulent secretions. Culture examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples was positive (> 10^5) for Enterococcus faecalis. No complications were registered during his stay in the pediatric ward. He was discharged after a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin, with the recommendation to complete a four-week course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. On his reevaluation 4 weeks after his discharge, he was asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of considering Enterococcus faecalis as an etiologic agent in cases of non-resolving or complicated cases of pneumonia, such as lung abscesses, even in young patients with no comorbidities or risk factors."

Blood cultures grew Enterococcus faecalis, and given a preceding history of steroid use and peripheral eosinophilia, Strongyloides hyperinfection was suspected. Stool specimens were positive for Strongyloides stercoralis larvae over four days, and larvae were also isolated in an early morning nasogastric aspirate specimen prior to initiation of ivermectin. A cerebrospinal fluid examination was consistent with partially treated bacterial meningitis and ventriculitis was demonstrated on neuroimaging. In view of a persistent fever, a further imaging evaluation was performed, which demonstrated bilateral pneumonia as well as the unusual finding of gas-forming emphysematous spondylodiscitis and left psoas abscesses. Despite the early suspicion of Strongyloides hyperinfection, commencement of appropriate antibiotics and anti-helminthics, microbiological clearance of bacteremia as well as clearance of S. stercoralis from the stool, the patient still succumbed to infection and passed away 11 days after admission."

Methods: A total of 1 872 neonates, who were admitted into NICU of Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital and subjected to mechanical ventilation from October 2016 to June 2018, were enrolled in the study. The neonates who met the diagnostic criteria of VAP were selected as the case group, and those who were treated with ventilator for 48 hours at the same time were regarded as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of VAP. Results: Of the 1 872 neonates who underwent the mechanical ventilation, the VAP occurred in 160 cases with the incidence rate of 8.5% (160 cases). The 227 specimens were collected. Gram-positive bacteria (n=116, 51.1%) were the main pathogens. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii. By Chi-square test, birth weight, birth age, Apgar score, duration of ventilator, and whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension were influencing factors. The result of logistic regression analysis showed that compared with no pregnancy included hypertension, the first aid measure at birth was initial resuscitation, and the MV time <= 5 days, the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates included: their mothers with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, using of tracheal intubation and ventilator time more than 5 days. Conclusion: The incidence of VAP in neonates receiving continuous MV therapy in neonatal intensive care unit is higher. Gram-positive bacteria are the main pathogens. VAP in neonates is related to whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension, MV duration and tracheal intubation."

Echocardiography showed severe aortic valve regurgitation, and he was diagnosed with active infective endocarditis. We performed re-do aortic valve neocuspidization using bovine pericardium. There was a tear on the non-coronary cusp and the cusps were thickened because of infection. Aortic annular tissue was not destroyed and we could fix the neo-valve directly to the annulus. After these procedures, severe reduction of antero-septal wall motion was noted, which suggested dissection of the main trunk of the left coronary artery. Coronary artery bypass grafting to the left anterior descending and the circumflex branches was added. The patient came off percutaneous cardio-pulmonary support 5 days after surgery.

Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected during a period from September 1984 to March 1985. We first determined types of respiratory diseases and found that, between 1981 and 1983, 57.9 approximately 64.5% of the examined diseases were chronic respiratory infections such as chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, and that these infections including diffuse panbronchiolitis accounted for 63.1% in 1984. Bacterial pneumonia was found to be 24.8% in 1981, but it was 11.0% in 1983 and 15.1% in 1984. These results seemed to reflect decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia in young population. We then investigated the correlations between these infections and isolates and found that distributions of causative organisms of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis during the 4 years were similar while the detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus from bacterial pneumonia increased in 1982 and 1983, and that of Gram-positive organisms such as Enterococcus faecalis rose in 1984. Branhamella catarrhalis was considered to be a non-pathogenic organism normally harbored in the upper respiratory tract. Recently, however, respiratory infections caused by this organism have been reported by some investigators. In our research also, this Gram-negative diplococcus was isolated as a causative organism of respiratory infections as 6 strains were found in 1983 and 29 strains in 1984, hence an increase was observed."

A total of 123 episodes in 68 consecutive patients with suspected pneumonia were analyzed. Blood cultures were negative in 110 cases (89 percent) and positive in 13 cases (11 percent) (p &lt; 0.001). Twelve of these 13 patients with positive blood cultures had quantitative PSB specimen cultures showing nonsignificant growth (&lt; 10(3) CFU/ml). In nine patients, the bacteria recovered from blood cultures (coagulase-negative staphylococci or sarcina) were considered nonpathogenic according to conventional criteria. Blood cultures grew a Staphylococcus aureus in two patients with previously documented staphylococcal septicemia. In one patient with no identifiable site of infection, the blood culture yielded Enterococcus faecalis. The only patient with both a positive blood culture and PSB culture results indicating pneumonia had different organisms recovered from the two samples. Blood cultures taken after PSB in the 17 other episodes of pneumonia (PSB specimen cultures &gt; or = 10(3) CFU/ml) were negative. At the time of brushing and blood sampling for culture, none of these patients was receiving antibiotics active on the organisms found. In conclusion, the incidence of bacteremia after PSB in ICU patients seems very low even in patients with documented pneumonia. Substantial savings would result from not performing routine blood cultures after PSB."

METHODS: From January 1990 through March 1996, 32 patients diagnosed with complicated prosthetic valve endocarditis underwent allograft root replacement. Mean age was 58.3 +/- 13.2 years; 23 patients were men. Mean preoperative New York Heart Association functional class was 3.4. Staphylococcus epidermidis (50%) and Enterococcus faecalis (19%) were the predominant causative microorganisms. Annular abscesses were found in 26 patients (81%), aortic-mitral discontinuity in 14 patients (43%), and left ventricular-aortic discontinuity in 11 patients (34%). A cryopreserved allograft was used in 31 patients (97%) and a fresh antibiotic-treated allograft was used in 1 patient (3%). Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 150 +/- 29 minutes. Mean duration of the postoperative antibiotic treatment was 38.5 +/- 11.8 days. RESULTS: There were three operative deaths (9.4%); causes of death were multiorgan failure in 2 patients (6.2%) and low cardiac output in 1 patient (3.2%). Six patients (18%) had complete heart block (4 patients already before the operation), 3 patients (9.4%) had temporary respiratory insufficiency, and 1 patient (3.2%) needed temporary hemodialysis. Mean follow-up was 37.4 +/- 22.4 months. Two late deaths occurred: 1 patient had recurrent endocarditis, leading to a false aneurysm, and died at reoperation; another patient died of lung cancer. Actuarial 5-year survival was 87.3% (70% confidence interval, 76.8% to 97.8%); actuarial 5-year freedom from recurrent endocarditis was 96.5% (70% confidence interval, 90.0% to 100%).

In this study, we prospectively investigated the role of ultrasound (US)-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacteriologic examination of infected cavitating lung tumors, and the influence of the culture results on the treatment of patients. Twenty-two patients (18 men and four women) with cavitating lung tumors treated from January 1996 to October 1998 were included. All patients underwent US-guided transthoracic aspiration for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. Microorganisms were isolated from six of seven febrile patients and one of 15 nonfebrile patients. A total of nine pathogens were isolated from seven patients: Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2); Enterococcus faecium (n = 1); Bifidobacterium (n = 1); Shewanella putrefaciens (n = 1); and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 1). Two pathogens were isolated from the aspirate cultures in two patients, while the others had monomicrobial infection. The six febrile patients who had positive lung aspirate cultures were treated with empiric antimicrobial agents before the culture results were available, and the culture results led to adjustment of the antibiotic regimen in five of these. The clinical conditions of the six patients with infected cavitating lung tumors improved after the initiation of individualized antimicrobial treatment. Pneumothorax occurred in one patient, and was the sole procedure-related complication. In conclusion, US-guided transthoracic aspiration is helpful for differentiating infected cavitating lung tumors from simple tumor necrosis. Infection in cavitating lung tumors is common among febrile patients, and the culture results can guide modification of the antimicrobial therapy."

It is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. It also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. METHODS: Using the terms linezolid, PNU-100766, and oxazolidinone, we performed a literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2000), HealthSTAR (1993 to September 2000), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966 to September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2000), PharmaProjects (January 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). RESULTS: Linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. Consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. It is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. To date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent requiring dose adjustment. Linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. Reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections."

In this prospective, non-randomized, noncomparative study, 19 patients were enrolled as part of the National Compassionate Study Protocol conducted by Pharmacia-Upjohn. At the time of this writing, these patients had not been published in the literature. All of the patients had to have documented evidence of serious gram-positive infections in normally sterile sites and should have been unable to tolerate available antimicrobial therapy or be unresponsive to available drugs. Clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were obtained. Patients were followed both short-term and long-term after completion of therapy. Nineteen patients were enrolled: 13 females and 6 males. The average age was 63 years. The average length of therapy with linezolid was 22 days. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was treated in eight patients, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in two patients, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in eight patients, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in two patients. Co-infecting organisms include Enterococcus species colonization in six patients, Pseudomonas species in one patient, Serratia marcenens in one patient, and Candida albicans in one patient. Sterile sites that were infected included bone and joint (wounds and septic joints) in six patients, gastrointestinal system (hepatobiliary, liver abscess, Crohn's) in five patients, genitourinary (kidney and urine) in two patients, blood in five patients, respiratory in one patient, and aortic valve in 1 patient. Linezolid was given at 600 mg IV every 12 hours with a mean length of therapy of 22 days. Surgical drainage was used in combination with linezolid in 11 of the patients. Seventy nine percent of these patients achieved clinical and microbiologic cure, and none of the deaths reported in this series were related to the drug. Adverse events included skin rash in one patient, mild bone marrow suppression in two patients, and mild elevation in liver function tests in two patients. No life-threatening adverse events were noted. It appears that linezolid, along with surgical intervention (when necessary), appears to be an effective treatment option for resistant gram-positive infections. Long-term studies evaluating the possible resistance rates are necessary."

The underlying diseases of this patient were chronic renal failure and diabetes mellitus. The patient died due to septic shock on the day of VRE isolation. Since this case was the first VRE infection in our hospital, a point prevalence study was planned. For this purpose, rectal swab samples collected from 10 patients from the same unit and 27 personnel who worked in the same unit, were screened for the presence of VRE. Nasal swabs and finger tip samples were also taken from the staff to determine if the transmission has occured in this way. As a result, a second VRE strain was isolated from another patient with chronic renal failure who was under treatment due to multiple pulmonary abscesses. Immediate isolation of this patient prevented a possible epidemic in this specific unit. In this report, the importance of VRE screening and isolation of the patients after the recovery of VRE has been emphasized."

In this report, we present a 69-year-old man who had the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with long-term steroid treatment suffered from a meningitis episode after hospitalisation for the urinary tract infection. The cerebrospinal fluid culture of the patient grew Enterococcus faecium which was resistant to vancomycin. A vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was also isolated from the rectal swab of the patient. These two E. faecium isolates were found to harbour the vanA gene and to be identical by pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing. The patient was treated successfully with intravenous linezolid, 600 mg every 12 h for 2 weeks. This was the first case of meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant E. faecium in Taiwan."

Vancomycin resistant enterococci are common and provide treatment challenges; however questions remain about VRE's pathogenicity and its direct clinical impact. This study analyzed the inflammatory response of Enterococcal BSI, contrasting infections from vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible isolates. METHODS: We performed a historical cohort study on 50 adults with enterococcal BSI to evaluate the associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and mortality. We examined SIRS scores 2 days prior through 14 days after the first positive blood culture. Vancomycin resistant (n = 17) and susceptible infections (n = 33) were compared. Variables significant in univariate analysis were entered into a logistic regression model to determine the affect on mortality. RESULTS: 60% of BSI were caused by E. faecalis and 34% by E. faecium. 34% of the isolates were vancomycin resistant. Mean APACHE II (A2) score on the day of BSI was 16. Appropriate antimicrobials were begun within 24 hours in 52%. Septic shock occurred in 62% and severe sepsis in an additional 18%. Incidence of organ failure was as follows: respiratory 42%, renal 48%, hematologic 44%, hepatic 26%. Crude mortality was 48%. Progression to septic shock was associated with death (OR 14.9, p &lt; .001). There was no difference in A2 scores on days -2, -1 and 0 between the VRE and VSE groups. Maximal SIR (severe sepsis, septic shock or death) was seen on day 2 for VSE BSI vs. day 8 for VRE. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of organ failure, 7-day or overall mortality between the two groups. Univariate analysis revealed that AP2&gt;18 at BSI onset, and respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hematologic and hepatic failure were associated with death, but time to appropriate therapy &gt;24 hours, age, and infection due to VRE were not. Multivariate analysis revealed that hematologic (OR 8.4, p = .025) and cardiovascular failure (OR 7.5, p = 032) independently predicted death. CONCLUSION: In patients with enterococcal BSI, (1) the incidence of septic shock and organ failure is high, (2) patients with VRE BSI are not more acutely ill prior to infection than those with VSE BSI, and (3) the development of hematologic or cardiovascular failure independently predicts death."

Autopsy is a powerful tool for analyzing the cause of a patient's death, progression of the disease, and the therapeutic response. However, it is frequently limited to the identification of bacterial strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis during the agonal phase of pneumonia, intrapulmonary sputum was harvested by directly inserting a swab into a resected lung, and the bacterial composition was analyzed using both pathological and microbiological techniques from 15 patients with hematological malignancies, and the results were compared with those from 25 patients with other medical and surgical diseases. Among the 54 bacteria strains isolated from the 40 patients, multidrug-resistant strains were significantly more prevalent in hematological group than in other diseases (16/21 versus 11/33, P = .002). Enterococcus faecium was preferentially isolated from the hematological patients, whereas the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was predominantly found in the nonhematological group. Two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in hematological diseases may be diagnosed as causative bacteria of pneumonia by both bacterial and pathological techniques. Although the results of this study may not be directly applicable for clinical diagnosis, this approach has a potential to become not only a diagnostic method for bacterial pneumonia, but may be also useful for the analysis of multidrug-resistant pathogens."

DATA SOURCES: Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI."

METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality."

A case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. All VREG isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of E. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of E. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. Eleven cases of VREG were identified between May through June 2004. VREG was isolated from blood (N=4), surgical secretions (N=4), paranasal sinus secretion (N=1), lung abscess (N=1) and urine (N=1). Infections with VREG were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. Logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for VREG infection. All isolates were identified as E. gallinarum, harboured the vanC1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by PFGE. Virulence-associated genes were not detected. This is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of VREG and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination."

Although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading Gram-positive species. We evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (North America, 43.0%; Latin America, 11.7%; Europe, 31.3%; and Asia-Pacific, 14.0%) Doripenem Surveillance Program for the years 2003 to 2007. Doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; MIC(90) values, &lt;or=0.06 microg/mL), with no differences noted between geographic regions. Against Enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC(50), 4 microg/mL) but was largely inactive against Enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). Although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the United States, doripenem was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. Doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; MIC(90), &lt;or=0.06 microg/mL, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; MIC(90), 0.25 microg/mL). Doripenem appears broadly active in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens."

Enterococci are frequently isolated from polymicrobial infections originating from the intestines. The impact of VR E. faecium on these infections and vice versa is not clear. METHODS: Mice were intestinally colonized with VR E. faecium during oral vancomycin treatment; control mice received oral vancomycin only. Fourteen days later, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed in all mice to induce polymicrobial peritonitis in the presence or absence of VR E. faecium colonization. RESULTS: VR E. faecium colonization per se was not associated with systemic dissemination of VR E. faecium. CLP resulted in systemic VR E. faecium infection in all VR E. faecium-colonized mice, with high VR E. faecium loads in peritoneal lavage fluid, blood, liver, and lungs. Forty-eight hours after CLP, mice infected with VR E. faecium had significantly lower bacterial loads in all organs tested than mice not infected with VR E. faecium. Additionally, lower inflammatory parameters were measured in VR E. faecium-infected mice. CLP induced transient liver and kidney damage, with a faster recovery in VR E. faecium-colonized mice. CONCLUSIONS: VR E. faecium infection, originating from a natural source (the intestinal tract), does not worsen the outcome of CLP-induced polymicrobial peritonitis and sepsis but rather facilitates bacterial clearance and attenuates host inflammatory responses."

Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns."

METHODS: a retrospective analysis of one case of Enterococcus faecium lung abscess and literature review was conducted. RESULTS: this patient suffered from cough and sputum over 6 months and complicated with hemoptysis over 3 months. Pulmonary embolism and lung cancer were suspected initially. After 2 times of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy the diagnosis of pneumonia was made in other hospitals. However, the consolidation in the lung progressed and cavity appeared although antibiotic therapy was conducted. After admission to our hospital, CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy was made and the lung tissue was sent for bacterial culture. Enterococcus faecium was cultured and it was susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. The disease improved significantly after treatment with these 3 antibiotics in turn. In addition, 13 cases of enterococcus pneumonia or lung abscess were reviewed, including 3 cases of enterococcus faecium lung abscess. CONCLUSIONS: enterococcus faecium is rarely a pathogen for lung abscess. The diagnosis of enterococcus faecium lung abscess could be confirmed by lung biopsy and bacterial culture of lung tissue which could also provide the susceptibility of antibiotics and guide the antibiotic therapy."

This work was a prospective evaluation in two series of cirrhotic patients admitted with infection or developing infection during hospitalization. The first series was studied between 2005 and 2007 (507 bacterial infections in 223 patients) and the second between 2010 and 2011 (162 bacterial infections in 110 patients). In the first series, 32% of infections were community acquired (CA), 32% healthcare associated (HCA), and 36% nosocomial. Multiresistant bacteria (92 infections; 18%) were isolated in 4%, 14%, and 35% of these infections, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E; n = 43) was the main multiresistant organism identified, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 17), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 14). The efficacy of currently recommended empirical antibiotic therapy was very low in nosocomial infections (40%), compared to HCA and CA episodes (73% and 83%, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001), particularly in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia (26%, 29%, and 44%, respectively). Septic shock (26% versus 10%; P &lt; 0.0001) and mortality rate (25% versus 12%; P = 0.001) were significantly higher in infections caused by multiresistant strains. Nosocomial origin of infection (hazard ratio [HR], 4.43), long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis (HR, 2.69), recent infection by multiresistant bacteria (HR, 2.45), and recent use of beta-lactams (HR, 2.39) were independently associated with the development of multiresistant infections. Results in the second series were similar to those observed in the first series. CONCLUSIONS: Multiresistant bacteria, especially ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are frequently isolated in nosocomial and, to a lesser extent, HCA infections in cirrhosis, rendering third-generation cephalosporins clinically ineffective. New antibiotic strategies tailored according to the local epidemiological patterns are needed for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections in cirrhosis."

Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens. SUMMARY: VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity."

The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs."

Silent catheter associated bacteriuria comprises a huge reservoir of resistant organism in hospitals particularly in critical care units. We prospectively studied 100 newly short-term catheterized patients in a tertiary care hospital. Samples collected on day three and daily thereafter for semi quantitative urine culture and pus cell count. Antibiotic sensitivity was tested using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Out of hundred patients, 32 showed growth on fifth day and remaining 68 samples were culture negative up to seventh day. None of the culture positive samples had pus cells. Escherichia coli (35%) was the predominant isolate followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Candida spp (15% each) and Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (5%). Among the Gram negative organisms, four strains of Escherichia coli and two strains of Klebsiella pneumonia were Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBL) producers and 33.3% were Multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Multidrug resistant pathogens in an asymptomatic short-term catheterized patient are a major reservoir in hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of periodic surveillance for nosocomial infections in hospital and the periodic screening will also help us to frame antibiotic policy in a new tertiary care hospital."

METHODS: The non-repetitive nosocomial pathogens isolated from bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infection (IAI) and the case data were collected from 13 teaching hospitals in different areas of China and sent to a central laboratory for re-identification and susceptibility testing. The levels of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the common antibiotics were determined by agar dilution method. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.6 software. RESULTS: A total of 2103 clinical isolates were collected from January to December 2011, of which gram positive cocci and gram negative organisms accounted for 23.2% and 76.8% respectively. The top three pathogens of BSI were E. coli (31.0%, 243/784), K. pneumoniae (14.8%, 116/784) and S. aureus (10.6%, 83/784). The top three pathogens of HAP were A. baumannii (24.2%, 158/652), P. aeruginosa (23.0%, 150/652) and K. pneumoniae (16.4%, 107/652). The top three pathogens of IAI were E. coli (34.3%, 229/667), E. faecium (13.3%, 89/667) and K. pneumoniae (9.6%, 64/667). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) accounted for 64.4% and 78.1% respectively. The susceptibility rates of Staphylococcus species to tigecycline, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid were all 100%. The prevalence of MRSA in HAP was significantly higher than that in BSI or IAI. The susceptibility rates of Enterococcus species to tigecycline, teicoplanin and linezolid were all 100%. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was 64.3% in E. coli and 38.3% in K. pneumonia. Against Enterobacteriaceae, the most active agents were as following in order: tigecycline (92.3% - 100%) [except P.mirabilis], meropenem (87.5% - 100%), imipenem (87.5% - 100%) [except M. morganii], amikacin (87.5% - 100%), polymyxin B (75% - 100%) [except S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and M morganii], cefepime (67.8% - 100%), cefoperazone-sulbactam (66.6% - 100%), piperacillin-tazobactam (61.5% - 100%). Carbapenem-resistance Enterobacteriaceae strains emerged. The susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa to imipenem and meropenem were 66.2% and 72.2%, respectively. The susceptibility rates of A. baumannii to imipenem and meropenem were 27.7% and 25.9%, respectively. The most active agents against A. baumannii were polymyxin B (100%), followed by tigecycline (79.8%) and minocycline (50.4%). The susceptibility rates of P.aeruginosa to antibiotics in BSI were higher than those in HAP and IAI. Susceptibility rates of S. maltophilia to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and levofloxacin were about 90% or above. Susceptibility rates of B. cepacia to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftazidime and meropenem were all 100%. Several P.aeruginosa and A. baumannii strains were resistant to all tested antibiotics except polymyxin B. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen profile is different in different types of infection. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii is high, which is still a key problem of nosocomial infection. Tigecycline remains relatively high activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria (except P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis) in vitro."

","SPECIES:Enterococcus faeciumID:24466106TITLE:A multidisciplinary intervention to reduce infections of ESBL- and AmpC-producing, gram-negative bacteria at a University Hospital.ABSTRACT:In response to a considerable increase in the infections caused by ESBL/AmpC-producing Klebsiella pneumonia in 2008, a multidisciplinary intervention, with a main focus on antimicrobial stewardship, was carried out at one university hospital. Four other hospitals were used as controls. Stringent guidelines for antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis were disseminated throughout the intervention hospital; cephalosporins were restricted for prophylaxis use only, fluoroquinolones for empiric use in septic shock only, and carbapenems were selected for penicillin-allergic patients, infections due to ESBL/AmpC-producing and other resistant bacteria, in addition to their use in severe sepsis/septic shock. Piperacillin-tazobactam +- gentamicin was recommended for empiric treatments of most febrile conditions. The intervention also included education and guidance on infection control, as well as various other surveillances. Two year follow-up data on the incidence rates of patients with selected bacterial infections, outcomes, and antibiotic consumption were assessed, employing before-and-after analysis and segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series, using the other hospitals as controls. The intervention led to a sustained change in antimicrobial consumption, and the incidence of patients infected with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae decreased significantly (p&lt;0.001). The incidences of other hospital-associated infections also declined (p's&lt;0.02), but piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium infections increased (p's&lt;0.033). In wards with high antimicrobial consumption, the patient gut carrier rate of ESBL-producing bacteria significantly decreased (p = 0.023). The unadjusted, all-cause 30-day mortality rates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli were unchanged over the four-year period, with similar results in all five hospitals. Although not statistically significant, the 30-day mortality rate of patients with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae decreased, from 35% in 2008-2009, to 17% in 2010-2011. The two-year follow-up data indicated that this multidisciplinary intervention led to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of ESBL/AmpC-resistant K. pneumoniae infections, as well as in the incidences of other typical hospital-associated bacterial infections.

METHODS: a total of 1,157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from January 2010 to December 2012 in the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were identified to species level with a VITEK-2 COMPACT fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus species was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of Enterococcus species from the burns department. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and the changes in the MIC of Enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment were evaluated. The beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emeA genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: the 1,157 clinical isolates of Enterococcus species included 679 E. faecium isolates (58.7%), 382 E. faecalis isolates (33%), 26 E. casseliflavus isolates (2.2%), 24 E. avium isolates (2.1%), and 46 isolates of other Enterococcus species (4%). The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between E. faecium and E. faecalis, and &lt;= 1.1% of these two Enterococcus species were found to be resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. In addition, the Enterococcus species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of Enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. The beta-lactamase gene TEM, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes aac(6')-aph(2""), aph(3')-III, ant(6)-I and ant(2"")-I, tetracycline resistance gene tetM, erythromycin resistance gene ermB, vancomycin resistance gene vanA and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emeA gene were detected in 77%, 62%, 26%, 13%, 36%, 31%, 66%, 5% and 55% of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. CONCLUSIONS: similar to previous findings, E. faecium and E. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. Multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent in the hospital isolates of Enterococcus species. Reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of Enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the MIC of Enterococcus species to these three fluoroquinolones. The presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emeA gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in Enterococcus species. The monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections."

Patients with malakoplakia often have an immunodeficiency state. It is believed that malakoplakia results from a defective macrophage response to phagocytosed bacteria. Malakoplakia most commonly affects the genitourinary tract. Cases confined to the liver are rare, with only five cases described in the literature. We report two cases of malakoplakia of liver; both were incidental autopsy findings. The first case involves a 53-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic refractory pancytopenia who presented with febrile neutropenia. His blood culture was positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterococcus faecium, and he subsequently developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The second case involves a 60-year-old man who presented with a mass in periorbital tissue which, on biopsy, showed inflammation and Treponema-like spirochetes. He died unexpectedly at home. Autopsy revealed adrenal gland chronic inflammation and abscess. Both cases had grossly normal livers with microscopic findings of calcified targetoid structures consistent with Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. In these cases, malakoplakia was an incidental finding confined to liver. Although asymptomatic in these cases, diagnosis in the liver may be useful to initiate a search for hepatic or non-hepatic infections. "

This review will highlight a case of gram negative bacteremia complicated by meningitis and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a fatal outcome of Strongyloides hyperinfection, commonly known to occur in the setting of immunosuppression. A middle aged female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia presented with severe respiratory distress requiring intubation. She had been on intermittent corticosteroids and multiple courses of antibiotics for the past six months for COPD exacerbations. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed Strongyloides stercoralis. Blood cultures grew Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci and a few days later Vancomycin Sensitive Enterococcus was found in the CSF. Afterwards, she grew Vancomycin Sensitive Enterococcus in the blood. She was treated with Ivermectin and Albendazole for Strongyloides and Linezolid and Vancomycin for these two different strains of E. faecium. After initial resolution of bacteremia and meningitis, she relapsed three weeks later with the same organism growing in the CSF. The clinical course continued to deteriorate with the development of significant neurological dysfunction.

METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished."

Formation of biofilm and production of DNase, hemolysin, lipase, and gelatinase were characterized. Biofilms of selected strains were examined for their susceptibility to antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). METHODS: All strains were tested for biofilm production by microtiter method and the activity of hemolysin, gelatinase, lipase, and DNase by plate method with an adequate substrate. Photodynamic therapy with Photolon and red laser light was performed towards 48 h biofilms of eight representative strains. The viability of biofilms was tested by the BactLight assay and visualized under a fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: Among the 400 isolates, 69.8% strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 30% of Enterococcus faecium, and 0.2% of Enterococcus casseliflavus were identified. In vitro, production of biofilm was found in 65.7% of enterococci. Biofilm-positive strains were isolated from urinary tract infections (81%), wound infections (71%), respiratory tract infections (62%), and gastrointestinal tract (47%) (colonization). Hemolysin activity was observed in 28.5%, gelatinase in 24.5%, lipase in 23%, and DNase in 3.5% of all, mostly biofilm-positive, isolates. Photodynamic therapy with Photolon efficiently reduced the enterococcal biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the high prevalence of biofilm-producing clinical enterococci, their virulence potential being higher than for biofilm-negative strains, and the susceptibility to aPDT of mature biofilms produced by strains, regardless of their species and site of isolation."

Cardiac surgery offers multiple treatment options for children with congenital heart defects. However, infectious complications still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Mediastinitis is a detrimental complication in children undergoing cardiac surgery. The risk of mediastinitis after delayed sternal closure is up to 10%. Case Presentation. We report a case of Enterococcus faecium mediastinitis in a 4-week-old female baby on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after Norwood procedure. Although repeated antibiotic irrigation, debridement, and aggressive antibiotic treatment were started early, the pulmonary situation deteriorated. Candida parapsilosis was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage after pulmonary hemorrhage. Disseminated C. parapsilosis infection with pulmonary involvement was treated with liposomal amphotericin B. Subsequently, inflammatory markers increased again and eventually C. parapsilosis was isolated from the central venous catheter. Conclusion. Children undergoing delayed sternal closure have a higher risk of mediastinitis. Therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis, for example, for soft tissue infection seems justified. However, long-term antibiotic treatment is a risk factor for fungal superinfection. Antifungal treatment of disseminated C. parapsilosis infection may fail in PICU patients with nonbiological material in place due to capacity of this species to form biofilms on medical devices. Immediate removal of central venous catheters and other nonbiological material is life-saving in these patients. "

Per patient, the last isolate per species per month was selected, and cumulative rates per 100 beds per month were determined. Time trends were analysed by multilevel Poisson regression. RESULTS: Eighteen ICUs used SOD/SDD (1296 months), 13 did not use SOD/SDD (936 months) and 11 introduced SOD/SDD (373 months before and 419 months after introduction). There was no significant increase in the rate of Gram-positive cocci in ICUs that used SOD/SDD. Introduction of SOD/SDD was associated with increased rates of S. aureus (beta = 0.018, 95% CI 0.006-0.030) and E. faecalis isolates (beta = 0.028, 95% CI 0.006-0.051) in respiratory tract specimens. Numbers of resistant phenotypes remained low, and an observed increase in E. faecium isolates (beta = 0.033, 95% CI 0.012-0.054), 97% of which were resistant to ampicillin, in the absence of SOD/SDD disappeared after the introduction of SOD/SDD. CONCLUSIONS: In ICUs with a low endemicity of resistance, introduction of SOD/SDD was associated with increased rates of S. aureus and E. faecalis isolates, but not with resistant phenotypes. Continuous 5 year use of SOD/SDD was not associated with increased isolation of Gram-positive cocci."

METHODS: Nosocomial cases as well as pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from 13 teaching hospital around China were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method. The CLSI M100-S23 criteria were used for interpretation. RESULTS: Of all cases, 1 022 cases were from BSI, 683 from HAP and 674 from IAI.Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most prevalent pathogens causing BSI and IAI while Acinetobacter baumanii (34.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were dominated in HAP. Tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem exhibited high potency against Enterobacteriaceae and the susceptibilities rates were 95.6%, 94.2%and 95.2% respectively. Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated high resistance against cephalosporins (52.3%) and fluoroquinolones (38.9%) but were susceptible to beta-lactam+inhibitor. Of all the Enterobacteriaceae, 30.5% were ESBLs positive and 4.3% were carbapenem resistant. Acinetobacter baumanii showed low susceptibilities to the microbial agents except for tigecycline (90.5%) and colistin (100%). The rate of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii was 76.6%. Amikacin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam showed high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with susceptible rate 88.5%, 77.6%, 72.7% and 64.5% respectively. The resistant rate to imipenem and meropenem were 42.1% and 32.2%. All Staphylococcus aureus (166 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin and glycopeptides. MRSA accounted for 46.9% of all the Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of MRSA in IAI (55.2%) and HAP (54.4%) were higher that that in BSI (35.0%). No Enterococcus strains were found resistant to tigecycline, linezolid and daptomycin. VRE was found in Enterococcus faecium, accounting for 1.9% of all Enterococcus faecium strains. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common pathogens causing nosocomial infections. Nosocomial pathogens showed high susceptibilities against tigecycline. For ESBLs-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains, beta-lactam+Inhibitor show high antibacterial activities. Vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid exhibit high potency to Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus."

METHODS: A total of 3849 Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus strains were isolated from Southern China during 2001-2015. Bacteria identification was performed by colony morphology, Gram staining, the API commercial kit and the Vitek 2 automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by disk diffusion method and MIC method. RESULTS: As sampling site was concerned, 51.4% of Staphylococcus strains were isolated from sputum, whereas urinary tract remained the dominant infection site among Enterococcus and Streptococcus. According to the antimicrobial susceptibility, three genus of important Gram-positive pathogens showed high resistance against erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. Resistance rates to penicillins (penicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin) were high as well, with the exception of E. faecalis and Streptococcus. Overall, resistance rates against methicillin (oxacillin) were 63.2% in S. aureus and 76.2% in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), along with continuous increases during the study. VRSA and vancomycin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus only appeared in 2011-2015. Sight decline was obtained for the vancomycin resistance of E. faecalis, while vancomycin-resistant E. faecium only appeared in 2011-2015, with its intermediate rate decreasing. Significant decrease in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (PRSP) was observed during studied period. Glycopeptide antibiotic remained highly effective to Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus (resistance rates &lt;5%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite decline obtained for some antibiotic agents resistance during 2001-2015, antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens still remained high in Southern China. This study may aid in the guidance for appropriate therapeutic strategy of infections caused by nosocomial pathogens."

It has nonspecific clinical manifestations that often mimic other disease entities especially in patients who have extensive comorbidities. Diagnosis is oftentimes delayed and rarely done antemortem. A high degree of suspicion in immunocompromised patients is necessary for evaluation and timely diagnosis. This is a case of Aspergillus pericarditis with cardiac tamponade in a renal transplant patient with liver cirrhosis. Two months after transplant, he developed decompensation of his cirrhosis from hepatitis C, acute cellular rejection, and Kluyvera bacteremia, followed by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) bacteremia. Four months after transplant, the patient presented with lethargy and fluid overload. He subsequently developed shock and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure. An echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. He had emergent pericardiocentesis that showed purulent drainage. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Amphotericin B was initiated when the pericardial fluid grew mold that was later identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. The patient quickly decompensated and expired."

This study evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics and pathogenicity of P. agglomerans in children. We retrospectively reviewed microbiological test results for all children (1 month old to 18 years old) who were admitted to our pediatric hospital between January 2000 to June 2015 and had positive clinical specimen cultures for P. agglomerans. Isolates were identified using conventional tests and the BBL Crystal E/NF ID or MALDI-TOF MS systems. Antibiotic susceptibilities were evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. We identified fifteen positive cultures from 14 patients with confirmed infections. The positive specimens included pus, urine, tracheal aspirate, blood, and central venous line samples that yielded P. agglomerans. The median patient age was 8.8 years (range: 1.5 months to 16.5 years), and all patients had underlying comorbidities. Five patients had medical devices, and two devices were removed. The most common P. agglomerans infections involved wound infections (35.7%), pneumonia (21.4%), and urinary tract infections (21.4%). Three patients had concomitant infections (Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus). Five patients had anemia. Three patients (21.4%) died, and all three had carbapenem-resistant P. agglomerans that was detected after the first week of hospitalization; two cases involved pneumonia, which was ineffectively treated. P. agglomerans infections may be life-threatening, especially in young patients with pneumonia. Hospital-acquired P. agglomerans may have different pathogenicity and clinical features, compared to community-acquired P. agglomerans, although further studies are needed to understand the drug-resistance patterns in this bacterium."

However, it is becoming more prevalent in temperate regions, and may be underdiagnosed. Here, pyomyositis is encountered as a complication of perforated diverticulitis, which has not been previously reported. A 61-year-old Caucasian man initially presented in respiratory distress and was diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation. The patient was taking high-dose prednisone, 60 mg daily for the past 2 years. Initially, he was afebrile, normotensive, tachycardic to 178 beats/minute and tachypneic to 28 breaths/minute, requiring noninvasive ventilation to maintain oxygenation. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis of 16.7x103/muL, and blood cultures grew Escherichia coli. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started but leukocytosis and bacteremia persisted on repeated tests. On the seventh hospital day, a CT scan of the abdomen was performed for complaints of abdominal pain, and the patient was diagnosed with Hinchey stage 3 diverticulitis. A Hartmann's procedure was performed with intraoperative findings of purulent peritonitis. Intraoperative cultures grew E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The patient continued to have leukocytosis of 15.1x103/muL despite surgical therapy. He began to complain of left lower extremity pain, and a CT scan on hospital day 24 revealed gluteal intramuscular abscesses, which were percutaneously drained. Persistent symptoms prompted another CT scan on hospital day 28, which revealed additional intramuscular abscesses in the vastus lateralis muscle, which was also drained, with subsequent resolution of pain and normalization of inflammatory markers. This is the first case demonstrating pyomyositis as a complication of diverticulitis. While the mechanism of pyomyositis may not be unique, it is important to recognize the potential complications of frequently encountered diseases. In this critically ill and immunosuppressed patient, there was delayed diagnosis of both diverticulitis and pyomyositis, but the patient quickly improved once the diseases were recognized and treated."

Under some cases of immune suppression (especially with corticosteroid administration), the nematode involved disseminates, leading to an amplified, possibly lethal hyper-infection syndrome. Case presentation: A 56-year-old Nepalese man presenting with chief complaints of nausea, vomiting, joint pain and abdominal cramps was admitted to Sumeru Hospital. His past history revealed: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), systemic hypertension and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had been treated with oral prednisolone (60 mg gl-1) for 8 days due to a presumed exacerbation of his COPD. Sequentially, he developed haemoptysis, chest tightness, frequent wheezing and worsening cough. Bronchoscopy showed severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage; microbiological examination of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was recommended. Examination of an acid fast bacilli stain preparation of BAL revealed filariform larvae of Strongyloides. Stool specimen examination revealed larvae of Strongyloides. The physical condition of the patient began to deteriorate; a few days after admission, vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecium was isolated from a blood sample. He was treated with ivermectin and albendazole for strongyloides and linezolid plus vancomycin for E. faecium. However, the patient failed to recover from the illness and died. Conclusion: The findings of our study suggest that corticosteroid administration in strongyloidiasis can lead to the development of fatal strongyloides hyper-infection syndrome. Hence our experience suggests the need for early diagnosis of strongyloidiasis to avoid such an outcome. A deterioration of the patient's condition after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy in endemic areas should raise the possibility of strongyloidiasis."

Patients and methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients from the Chinese Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections (CARES) program between 2007 and 2016. Data on the clinicopathological factors and causative pathogens were collected. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) interpretive breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2017. Results: A total of 2,756 patients were included. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 9.5% (262/2,756). Multivariable analysis showed that the following independent risk factors were associated with the 30-day mortality: age &gt;60 years, pulmonary disease, tracheal cannula, infection occurring in intensive care unit (ICU), prior admission within 3 months, antibiotic use before infection, recent use of immunosuppressants, and multidrug-resistant organisms. In addition, 2,913 clinical isolates were collected. The Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 70.8% and 29.2% of all isolates, respectively. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (33.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.8%), and Enterococcus faecium (10.7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative pathogens. E. faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common Gram-positive pathogens. E. coli, A. baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae were more commonly found in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. Overall, the antibiotics tested in the CARES exhibited diminished susceptibility to pathogens over the study period, especially extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing isolates. Conclusion: Considering the current data set and high-level resistance of intra-abdominal pathogens to various antibiotics, further monitoring of the epidemiology of IAIs and their susceptibility to antibiotics through the CARES is warranted."

METHODS: The clinical data of patients with COBSI in emergency department admitted to Huashan North Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University from January 2014 to December 2017 were collected, and the distribution and drug resistance of pathogen were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into community-acquired bloodstream infection (CABSI) group and health care-associated bloodstream infection (HCABSI) group according to clinical diagnosis. The source of patients, past health status, blood culture isolation of pathogens, drug sensitivity test results were recorded, and the trend of drug resistance of main pathogens to common antibiotics from 2014 to 2017 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 258 pathogens were isolated from patients, including 186 Gram-negative pathogens (G- pathogens, 72.09%) and 72 Gram-positive pathogens (G+ pathogens, 27.91%), while the fungal strain was not isolated. The two most frequently isolated G- pathogens causing CABSI were Escherichia coli (80 isolates, 65.57%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (24 isolates, 19.67%), including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Escherichia coli (37 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumonia (3 isolates), the average detection rates were 46.25% and 12.50% respectively. The two most frequently isolated G+ pathogens were Streptococcus (32 isolates, 57.14%) and Staphylococcus (15 isolates, 26.79%), but methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) had not been isolated. The two most frequently isolated G- pathogens causing HCABSI were Escherichia coli (45 isolates, 70.32%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (7 isolates, 10.94%), including ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli (20 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumonia (1 isolate), the average detection rate was 44.44% and 14.29%, respectively. The most frequently isolated G+ pathogens were Staphylococcus (10 isolates, 62.50%), Streptococcus (3 isolates, 18.75%) and Enterococcus faecium (3 isolates, 18.75%), including MRSA (3 isolates). ESBLs-positive Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were almost completely resistant to cefazolin and highly resistant to ampicillin, ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium, ceftriaxone and furadantin, with the drug resistance rates of higher than 50%, and the drug resistance rate was significantly higher than that of corresponding ESBLs-producing negative pathogens. Escherichia coli were completely sensitive to piperacillin tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, but Klebsiella pneumoniae had some resistance to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) were highly resistant to common antibiotics, while Streptococcus strains and MRSA had low resistance rates, and all pathogens were completely sensitive to linezolid and vancomycin. The average annual resistance rate of Escherichia coli to common antibiotics in CABSI group was increased, but the difference was significant only for ciprofloxacin (from 2014 to 2017, they were 37.5%, 28.6%, 52.6%, 65.2%, respectively, Z = 5.076, P = 0.024). The average annual resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumonia to cefazolin and ciprofloxacin in CABSI group and that of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone in HCABSI group showed an increasing trend without significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the main pathogens of emergency COBSI, ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli were more common, and the average annual drug resistance rate to common clinical antibiotics was increasing. The drug resistance of ESBLs-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was more serious than that of ESBLs-producing negative pathogens, so antibiotics should be used rationally."

Both patients were diagnosed with moderately severe acute pancreatitis and received fluid resuscitation, an opioid analgesic, antibiotics, and a protease inhibitor. However, owing to unrelenting pain, we performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for pancreatic duct drainage in both patients. ERCP showed a stricture in the MPD in the pancreatic tail with upstream dilatation. A 5-Fr NPD tube was inserted to drain the dilated MPD, and cloudy pancreatic juice was drained. NPD tube placement led to pain relief in both patients. Pancreatic juice cultures grew Enterococcus faecium and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively. The NPD tube was later cut in both cases using a pair of scissor forceps."

We sought to determine the magnitude, etiology, and risk factors of CAP in children 5 years after introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 10 in Ethiopia. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study on the bacterial etiology and risk factors of CAP among children aged 0-15 years in 2 pediatric emergency departments in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Blood culture, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and amplification of pneumococcal lytA and cpsB genes were performed. Serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined by Quellung reaction and sequencing the cpsB gene. Results: Out of 643 eligible children, 549 were enrolled. The prevalence of bacteremic pneumonia was 5.6%. Staphylococcus aureus (26.5%) was the predominant pathogenic species, followed by Enterococcus faecium (11.8%), Escherichia coli (11.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.8%). In univariate analysis, parental smoking and nonvaccination with PCV10 were associated with bacteremic CAP. In multivariable analysis, female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.9), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) &lt;-2 SDs (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8), and lower chest indrawing (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.2-0.95) were independently associated with bacteremic CAP. The overall in-hospital case fatality rate was 2.37% (13/549), and WAZ &lt;-3 SDs (OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 3.95-46.12) was associated with mortality. Conclusions: Five years after the introduction of PCV10 in Ethiopia, S. aureus was the main cause of bacteremic CAP in children, the contribution of S. pneumoniae was low, and there was a high level of antibiotic resistance among isolates."

Added that a paucity of studies referred to ESKAPEEc in pediatric BSIs, our study aimed to demonstrate the longitudinal alterations of ESKAPEEc distribution and antibiogram in adult and pediatric BSIs in Southwest China. Methods: A multicenter retrospective surveillance study was launched from 2012 to 2017. Data of China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS) was analyzed by Whonet 5.6 and Graphpad Prism 6 Software. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to examine and compare temporal changes. Results: A total of 32,259 strains was isolated, with 17.4% from pediatric BSIs. ESKAPEEc contributed to 58.67% (18,924/32,259) of BSIs, with 65.3% of adult BSIs and 27.2% of pediatric BSIs. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) were the two predominant species. Carbapenem resistance was prevalent in 0.76, 4.60, 9.47,13.66, 59.47% of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), respectively. The proportions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREFM) were 28.91% and 2.20%, respectively. Between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, E. coli and K. pneumonia showed significantly increased resistance rates to imipenem but decreased to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, while A. baumannii exhibited reduced resistances to almost all the beta-lactams tested. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to most of agents against Gram-positive ESKAPEEc did not significantly varied during the same timeframe. In comparison with those from adult BSIs, K. pneumoniae from pediatric BSIs exhibited high resistance rates to all the beta-lactams tested, especially to carbapenems (12.79% vs 3.87%), while A. baumannii showed low resistance rates to all the agents. Conclusions: Ongoing burden of ESKAPEEc in BSIs and increasing trend of imipenem resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae call for continued surveillance. Carbapenems are still active against Gram-negative ESKAPEEc, except for A. baumannii and vancomycin or linezolid is still effective against Gram-positive ESKAPEEc. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in children and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii in adults necessitate effective antimicrobial strategies in consideration of age stratification."

Linezolid has potential adverse effects like bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy and hyponatremia. One of the extremely rare reported adverse effects of the drug is hypoglycaemia. We present a case of Linezolid toxicity presenting as resistant hypoglycemia, bone marrow suppression and severe hyponatremia all together in a single patient. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of an 82 years old gentleman with no known chronic co-morbidities. He was started on Linezolid 600 mg twice a day for 10 days by a local doctor possibly for some minor infection post hip surgery. He was in respiratory distress on arrival. Blood sugars showed severe hypoglycemia of 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L). He was admitted in intensive care unit and started on injectable antibiotics and 5% dextrose infusion and sugars were strictly monitored. His blood tests revealed severe hyponatremia with sodium level of 119 mEq/L and haemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 gm/dL, leucocytes of 6500/microL, platelets of 82 000/microL. The infection markers were normal throughout. The platelet count went progressively down from 82 000/microL on admission to 20 000/microL 2 days later; before it started rising back. Similarly there was drop in Hemoglobin and white cell counts. He required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressures. The blood sugar levels stabilized after the same. However patient had suffered acute lung injury secondary to aspiration and became NIV dependent and eventually passed away. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our case was unique in a way that our patient had adverse effects of linezolid like myelosuppression as well as the rare side effects of hypoglycemia at the same time. This combination of adverse events has never been described in the past to our knowledge. All the adverse effects responded to antibiotic de-challenge in our case. We had ruled out the possibility of other causes of Hypoglycemia such as sepsis, insulinoma, alcohol excess, malnutrition or hypoadrenalism. We searched the PubMed database and found four case reports out of which two were diabetics and other two were non diabetics. Out of 15 cases described by Vishwanathan et al only three cases were non diabetics. Our patient was non diabetic as well. Therefore our case is only the sixth reported case of hypoglycemia in non diabetic receiving Linezolid to our knowledge."

The characteristics of secondary infection, which are well known to clinicians, need to be re-examined in detail, and their understanding among clinicians needs to be updated accordingly. AIM: This study aims to investigate the characteristics and drug resistance of pathogens causing severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) secondary infection, to objectively present infection situation, and to provide reference for improved clinical management. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 55 consecutive patients with SAP who developed secondary infection with an accurate evidence of bacterial/fungal culture from 2016 to 2018. The statistics included the spectrum and distribution of pathogens, the drug resistance of main pathogens, and associations between multiple infectious parameters and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 181 strains of pathogens were isolated from (peri)pancreas; bloodstream; and respiratory, urinary, and biliary systems in 55 patients. The strains included 98 g-negative bacteria, 58 g-positive bacteria, and 25 fungi. Bloodstream infection (36.5%) was the most frequent infectious complication, followed by (peri)pancreatic infection (32.0%). Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were predominant among gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacterial infections were mainly caused by Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus spp. Fungal infections were predominantly caused by Candida spp. The drug resistance of pathogens causing SAP secondary infection was generally higher than the surveillance level. Patients in the death group were older (55 +- 13 years vs. 46 +- 14 years; p = 0.039) and had longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay (14 vs. 8; p = 0.026) than those in the survival group. A. baumannii infection (68.4% vs. 33%; p = 0.013), number of pathogens >= 4 (10 vs. 6; p = 0.005), pancreatic infection (14 vs. 15, p = 0.024), and urinary infection (8 vs. 5; p = 0.019) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria are the main pathogens causing SAP secondary infection, in which nosocomial infections play a major role. The drug resistance profile of gram-negative bacteria is seriously threatening, and the commonly used antibiotics in SAP are gradually losing their effectiveness. Much attention should be paid to the rational use of antibiotics, and strategies should be established for infection prevention in SAP."

We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism. The patient was successfully treated with a four-week course of linezolid according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should consider multi-drug resistant organisms such as VRE in uremic patients with pneumonia that fails to resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the cases with aspiration induced by epilepsy, immunocompromised conditions, and repeated or prolonged hospitalizations."

This FDA cleared technology can detect 5 of the most prevalent pathogens causing bacteremia (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecium). Because the significance of discordant results between the T2Bacteria assay and blood culture (BC) remains a challenge, in this case series we reviewed the medical records of patients who had a positive T2Bacteria test and a concurrent negative BC. METHODS: Among 233 participants, we identified 20 patients with 21 (9%) discordant T2Bacteria-positive/BC-negative (T2+/BC-) results. We classified these results based on clinical cultures and clinical evidence. RESULTS: When we analyzed these 21 discordant results in-depth, 11 (52.5%) fulfilled criteria for probable BSI, 4 (19%) for possible BSI, and 6 (28.5%) were presumptive false positives. Among the probable/possible BSIs, discordant results were often associated with patients diagnosed with closed space and localized infections [pyelonephritis (n = 7), abscess (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 1), infected hematoma (n = 1), and osteomyelitis (n = 1)]. Also, within the preceding 2 days of the T2+/BC- blood sample, 80% (16/20) of the patients had received at least one dose of an antimicrobial agent which was active against the T2Bacteria-detected pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of discrepant results, the T2Bacteria assay detected a plausible pathogen that was supported by clinical and/or microbiologic data. Discrepancies appear to be associated with closed space and localized infections and the recent use of effective antibacterial agents. The clinical significance and potential implications of such discordant results should be further investigated."

It typically causes pulmonary disease, but it can also cause extrapulmonary disease. Immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk of developing the infection, but it has been reported in individuals with competent immune system as well. We present a unique case of infectious endocarditis (IE) due to a R. equi infection in an immunocompetent patient. A 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, systolic heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery for coronary and valvular heart disease. His transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe aortic stenosis and multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and simultaneous aortic valve replacement. Intraoperatively, there was exudative material covering his aortic valve, which was sent for tissue culture. Tissue culture was positive for R. equi and Enterococcus faecium.  R. equi endocarditis is a rare presentation of this organism. R. equi endocarditis is a very challenging diagnosis due to its varying presentation compared to typical IE. Detailed history taking and physical exam are extremely important to determine if further evaluation is needed. Prolonged oral and intravenous antibiotics are recommended for effective treatment."

All isolates were confirmed by molecular methods (16SrRNA and E. faecium ddl genes) and tested for disk diffusion. PCR was used to detect aac(6')-aph(2''), vanA and vanB resistance genes, and asa1, cylA, ace, esp, gelE and hyl virulence genes. VREfm and high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) representative isolates were selected to characterize by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Of 173 isolates, 73 (42.2%), 146 (84.4%), and 0 (0.0%) were vanA-containing VREfm, aac(6')-aph(2'')-positive HLGR, and vanB-positive. Independent predictors of VREfm infection were hematological malignancies (P = 0.001) and previous hospitalizations (P = 0.007). Observed mortality rate was 34.7%. Independent predictors of BSI-related mortality were endotracheal intubations (P < 0.001), gastrointestinal diseases (P = 0.002), and pulmonary disease (P < 0.001). All VREfm were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. The esp, hyl, ace, asa1, cylA, and gelE genes were detected at 55.9, 22.5, 2.9, 2.3, 1.7, and 1.2%, respectively. The esp gene was significantly associated with VREfm compared to VSEfm (P = 0.001). PFGE analysis revealed 23 clones, with 7 major clones.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%. The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem increased annually. The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones, Aminoglycosides were <5% even when compared to carbapenems. Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

Serious community and nosocomial enterococcal infections involved a variety of sites, and antibiotic resistance was common. Types of infection by major organ system were cardiovascular, 54% (catheter-related bacteremia 28%, primary bacteremia 18%, endocarditis 6%, septic thrombophlebitis 1%); intra-abdominal, 13% (including cholangitis, 6%); renal, 13%; skin and soft tissue, 5%; bone and joint, 4%; pleuropulmonary, 4%; central nervous system, 3%; deep surgical wound, 3%; and endometritis, 2%. Sixty-one percent of infections were nosocomial; 48% of these occurred in the intensive care unit. Enterococcus faecium was responsible for 20% of all infections. Antibiotic resistances among the infections included high-level gentamicin resistance (26%), ampicillin resistance (10%), and vancomycin resistance (8%). Clinical cure was achieved in 64% of patients; 6.8% of patients relapsed, 6.8% had recurrence of the infection with a different pathogen, and overall mortality was 23%.

To understand the clinical significance of E. faecium bacteremia, we compared 16 patients who were bacteremic due to E. faecium to 56 patients who were bacteremic due to Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecium bacteremia developed most frequently in severely ill patients with fever or hypothermia accompanied by CNS, cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary dysfunction, while E. faecalis bacteremia occurred most often in less seriously ill patients. Nosocomial acquisition, cancer, neutropenia, renal insufficiency, current corticosteroid therapy, and previous treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics were significantly more frequently associated with E. faecium bacteremia. Mortality was significantly higher among patients infected with E. faecium than among those infected with E. faecalis (50% vs. 11%; P = .001); this was true particularly among patients with monomicrobial or nosocomial bacteremia, those who had previously received antibiotic treatment, and those with cancer. Death due to enterococcal bacteremia was observed only among severely ill patients.

Most community-acquired cases were in infants, in comparison with nosocomial episodes (24/26 and 34/57; p &lt; 0.01); many of them were neonates (10/26 and 6/57; p &lt; 0.01). Nosocomial cases were associated with underlying conditions including major surgery 56%, immunosuppression 49%, organ and tissue transplants 30%, and cardiac 32%, pulmonary 25%, renal 21%, and hepatic 21% disorders. Nosocomial episodes developed after a median of 32 days. There were 58 primary and 25 secondary bacteremias. Thirty-two episodes were polymicrobial and 44 organisms were involved. Twenty-six percent of the patients died. In 15%, death was preceded by septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and polymicrobial bacteremia (p &lt; 0.01). Of 75 isolates, 82% were Enterococcus faecalis and 14% were Enterococcus faecium. Fourteen E. faecalis strains produced hemolysin; none produced beta-lactamase. Three had high-level resistance to gentamicin and 13 to streptomycin; two E. faecium and none of the E. faecalis strains were vancomycin resistant at a low level (p &lt; 0.01) and one was ampicillin resistant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of whole-cell DNA digested with restriction enzymes Sma I and Eag I showed five isolates with a homogeneous pattern, two with another homogeneous pattern, and 68 with distinct heterogeneous patterns. The increase in enterococcal bacteremias was not due to a clonal strain dissemination but to an increase in cases of heterogeneous enterococcal strains. We conclude that enterococcal septicemia is now an important cause of serious morbidity and death in critically ill children."

Ninety four cases were nosocomial infection (92.2%) and 8 community infection (7.8%); There were pneumonia in 80 (78.4%), septicemia in 11 (10.8%), and infection of other organsin 11 (10.8%); Forty five cases were proven gram positive coccus bacteria infection, and 57 were suspected infection; Fifty one bacteria strains were isolated from cultivated samples of proven patients, in which 22 were staphylococcus aureus with 19 methicillin resistant 13 hemolytic streptococcus, 9 staphylococcus epidermidis with 7 methicillin resistant 6 enterococcus faecom, and 1 enterococcus hirae. Seven cases were mixed with one kind gram negative bacillus infection, 4 mixed with two kinds of gram negative bacillus infection, and 12 mixed with fungal infection; Total clinical response rates by ITT (intention to treatment) analysis was 69.6%, in which 40 (39.2%) were curative and 31 (30.4%) obviously effective; PP (per-protocol) analysis was 70.9%, in which 39 (41.9%) were curative and 27 (29.0%) obviously effective. Bacteria clearance rate was 70.6%, and in this group the clinical effective rate was 88.9%; Adverse effect rate was 2.9%, being transient thrombocytopenia and increased transaminase. CONCLUSION: Linezolid is a safe and effective antibiotic used in hematological disease patients complicated with infections of gram positive coccus."

OBJECTIVES: Field cases were studied to increase knowledge on clinical and pathological characteristics, pathogenesis and epidemiology of these infections. ANIMALS AND METHODS: In total, 1266 birds of 25 flocks from 12 farms were examined. Post-mortem examinations, bacteriology, histopathology, PCR and DNA fingerprinting was carried out. Six flocks were followed longitudinally (n = 1017 birds). RESULTS: Average mortality was 4.1% for the entire grow-out, of which 36% was attributed to endocarditis. Fibrinous thromboendocarditis of the right atrioventricular (AV) valve was found in 24% of hearts, compared to 7% and 4% with lesions of left and both AV valves, respectively. Thrombotic lesions were found in 24% (n = 432) of lungs, but only in larger branches of the Arteria pulmonalis. Occasionally, thrombi were found in the Arteria ischiadica externa and in liver and brain vessels. Enterococcus was cultured from 54% (n = 176) of heart and in 75% (n = 28), 62% (n = 106) and 31% (n = 16) of liver, bone marrow and lung samples, respectively. Further identification, using the Rapid ID Strep 32 API system and a PCR targeting mur-2 and mur-2(ed) genes was carried out on a subset of Enterococcus positive isolates (n = 65): both techniques identified the isolates as Enterococcus hirae. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis did not indicate evidence of clonality between farms and flocks. CONCLUSIONS: The relevance of these findings for pathogenesis and epidemiology of E. hirae infections is discussed. CLINICAL IMPORTANCE. This study may facilitate diagnosis of field cases and may contribute to the design of further research and development of control measures."

We describe a case of E. hirae bacteremia and pneumonia in a bird breeder and its potential relationship with regorafenib, a tirosin kinase inhibitor (TKI). METHODS: Descriptive study and review of the literature through a PubMed search of the cases described previously to date. RESULTS: Only seventeen cases have been described, mainly endocarditis, pyelonephritis, and intraabdominal infections. No cases of pneumonia have been reported so far. The recent increase in TKI use opens a new field to explore in infectious diseases due to both the exposure to these immunosuppressive drugs and the increased survival of subjects with severe underlying comorbidities. CONCLUSION: In patients in contact with birds, immunosuppressed by their underlying morbidities and treated with regorafenib, clinicians should be aware of an increased risk of unusual potentially severe infections."

We present the fifth known case of E. hirae endocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian female presented with fever, hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a two-week history of lightheadedness. Her previous medical history included COPD, recurrent DVT, atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Physical exam was notable for expiratory wheezes and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right sternal border. 2D echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis. The patient underwent right and left heart catheterization, where she was found to have severe aortic stenosis and mild pulmonary hypertension. She subsequently underwent minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a bovine pericardial valve, bilateral atrial cryoablation, and clipping of the left atrial appendage. Her aortic valve was found to have a bicuspid, thickened appearance with calcifications, multiple small vegetations, and a root abscess beneath the right coronary cusp. With a new suspicion of infective endocarditis, the patient was placed on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Intra-operative blood cultures were negative. A tissue culture from the aortic valve vegetations identified Enterococcus hirae susceptible to ampicillin through MALDI-TOF. Antibiotic treatment was then switched to IV ampicillin and ceftriaxone; she declined aminoglycoside treatment due to toxicity concerns. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged with 6 weeks of antibiotics. To date, she continues to be followed with no signs of relapsing disease. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this case constitutes the fifth known case of E. hirae endocarditis, and the second case to have been identified with MALDI-TOF and treated with ampicillin and ceftriaxone. This case reinforces the efficacy of ampicillin and ceftriaxone for the treatment of E. hirae endocarditis."

Infection is the most morbid complication of ERCP and among the most common causes of ERCP-related death. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, obstructive jaundice and abnormal liver function tests. Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation. After receiving intravenous antibiotics for acute cholecystitis, the patient was discharged. Two weeks later, an endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated gallstones and CBD dilation of up to 6.4 mm with 2 filling defects. An ERCP was performed with a papillotomy and stone extraction. Twenty-four hours post-ERCP the patient developed a fever, chills, bilirubinemia and elevated liver function tests. Ascending cholangitis was empirically treated using Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole. However, the patient remained febrile, with a diffusely tender abdomen and elevated inflammatory markers. A CT revealed a very small hypodense lesion in the seventh liver segment. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive Klebsiella Pneumonia and Enterococcus Hirae were identified, and the antibiotics were switched to Imipenem and Cilastatin. The hypodense lesion in the liver increased to 1.85 cm and a new hypodense lesion was seen in the right psoas. At day 10 post-ERCP, the patient started having low back pain and difficulty walking. MRI revealed L4-L5 discitis with a large epidural abscess, spanning L1-S1 and compressing the spinal cord. Decompressive laminectomy of L5 was done and Klebsiella pneumonia was identified. Due to continued drainage from the wound, high fever, we performed a total body CT which revealed increased liver and iliopsoas abscess. Decompressive laminectomy was expanded to include L2-L4 and multiple irrigations were done. Gentamycin and Vancomycin containing polymethylmethacrylate beads were implanted locally and drainage catheters were placed before wound closure. Multidisciplinary panel discussion was performed, and it was decided to continue with a non invasive approach . CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of complications and individualized therapy by a multi-disciplined team is important for managing post-ERCP septic complications. Particular attention should be given to adequate coverage by empiric antibiotics."

We diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria that occurred during several months and was caused by Gemella morbillorum and Candida glabrata, respectively. We have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. Staphylococcus oureus, Streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in 70% of the cases. Average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months. We conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. In the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. We suggest that right-sided endocarditis must be considered in any patient with the ""Tricuspid Syndrome,"" consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria.

METHODS: Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage Lowenstein-Jensen mycobacterial culture isolates from consecutive, HIV-infected patients admitted to Mulago Hospital with 2 weeks or more of cough were subjected to IS6110 PCR and rpoB genetic analysis to determine the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). RESULTS: Eighty (100%) mycobacterial cultures from 65 patients were confirmed to be members of MTBC. Subsequent analysis of the cultures from 54 patients by PCR and sequence analyses to identify co-infection with NTM confirmed the presence of MTBC as well as the presence of Micrococcus luteus (n = 4), Janibacter spp. (n = 1) and six cultures had organisms that could not be identified.

Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients.

In this study, we set out to verify the frequency, usefulness, and costs of blood cultures in RSV infections. We addressed the issue by reviewing medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days-121 months, who were hospitalized during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57 patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10 cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1; Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1; Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to $1980. If performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached $5490. In conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection, with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus, blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children hospitalized due to RSV infection."

Odontogenic background of infection and initial clinical presentation suggested the presence of typical bacterial flora and uncomplicated course of treatment. However, despite surgical intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the expected improvement of a clinical status was not achieved. Only detailed bacteriological examination allowed to establish a bacterial pathogen and start a targeted antibiotic therapy. The unusual clinical course was monitored by imaging CT examination and further surgical interventions. A significant improvement was obtained in the third week of hospitalization and further antibiotic therapy was continued by means of outpatient treatment. Rothia mucilaginosa infection together with dental intervention is a rare case, since most of the reports in the literature concern the patients with decreased immunity. In such patients, the most common areas of infection were: the peritoneum, lung tissue and meningeal spaces of the brain and the presence of a foreign body. "

R. mucilaginosa is considered a part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx and upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract infections attributable to R. mucilaginosa are not frequent. We present a case of pneumonia, in which the R. mucilaginosa infection was diagnosed by quantitative cultures of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen. A 46-yr-old woman with B lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted to the hospital for scheduled chemotherapy. Her chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral multifocal nodular and patchy consolidation in both lungs. Investigation of the BAL specimen revealed that 7% of leukocytes had intracellular gram-positive cocci. The quantitative cultures of the BAL specimen grew mucoid, non-hemolytic, and grayish convex colonies on blood agar at a count of approximately 200,000 colony-forming units/mL. The colonies were identified as R. mucilaginosa. The patient was empirically treated with levofloxacin for 7 days, after which findings on the chest radiograph and CT scan improved. She was discharged with improvement on hospital day 46. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. mucilaginosa pneumonia diagnosed in Korea. Quantitative culture of BAL specimen and examination of intracellular organisms are crucial for assessing the clinical significance of R. mucilaginosa recovered from the lower respiratory tract."

While it is often times normal human oral and upper respiratory tract microbiota, it can be a virulent pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Most commonly, it causes bacteremia (catheter and non-catheter related) and meningitis in these patients. Our objective was to report the incidence of R. mucilaginosa infections in neutropenic children with hematological malignancies or following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at a major children's hospital. We report 11 patients in this cohort who developed clinically significant R. mucilaginosa infections, including three deaths directly attributable to this microorganism. Three patients developed significant neurological involvement, accounting for two of the deaths, and one patient died of disseminated infection. Except for one, all patients had severe neutropenia, central line catheters, and mucosal breakdown at the time of infection. Patients who succumbed never achieved neutrophil recovery. In conclusion, R. mucilaginosa can lead to life-threatening infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially in profoundly neutropenic patients. "

METHODS: Retrospective study of 20 cases diagnosed with R. mucilaginosa from 2009 to 2012. RESULTS: Pulmonary infection was the most frequent clinical presentation (n=14, 70%): bronchiectasis infected (10), followed by pleural empyema (2), pneumonia (1) and acute bronchitis (1). Two episodes were of gastrointestinal origin: cholangitis secondary to biliary drainage and secondary peritonitis. Two episodes included bacteremia in patients with hematological malignancy. One patient had a surgical wound infection with bacteremia, and another had a bacteremic urinary tract infection in a patient with nephrostomy.

Although this organism is believed to be of low virulence, it is increasingly recognized as an opportunistic pathogen mostly affecting immunocompromised hosts. METHODS: The medical literature was reviewed and we found 19 published cases of R. mucilaginosa pneumonia. We also report on a case of pneumonia attributed to this microorganism in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). RESULTS: From January 1970 to August 2014, a total of 20 patients with R. mucilaginosa pneumonia were studied. Patients with haematologic malignancies (7/20), profoundly neutropenic with central line catheters (7/20) are at higher risk of developing the infection, while immunocompetent hosts with impaired pulmonary defences are less frequently affected (4/20). Beta-lactams or vancomycin alone or in combination with other antibiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of R. mucilaginosa pneumonia. The outcome was favourable in 18 cases. Only one fatality was attributed to the infection. CONCLUSION: R. mucilaginosa should be considered in the diagnosis of pneumonia in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Early diagnosis and timely administration of appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary for cure."

We encountered three cases of bacteremia due to R. mucilaginosa during neutropenia after chemotherapy for myeloid malignancies. Although all three patients were successfully treated with antimicrobial agents, one patient developed disseminated lesions in the lungs and soft tissue. The portal of R. mucilaginosa bacteremia is reportedly mucositis or dental disorders; however, no such complications were identified in our patients. Even in the absence of a preexisting portal, R. mucilaginosa should be recognized as a potential causative pathogen of bacteremia during neutropenic periods. Accumulations of cases and isolates are required to further elucidate the risk factors for developing R. mucilaginosa bacteremia, its clinical course, and the optimal antimicrobial treatment. "

Although rarely pathogenic in an immunocompetent host, it can cause severe opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old white woman had a routine blood analysis before undergoing knee surgery. The results showed leukopenia for which bone marrow examination was performed, showing an underlying acute myeloid leukemia. During the neutropenic phase after a second induction with cytarabine/idarubicin, she developed fever, headaches, and photophobia. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were positive for Rothia mucilaginosa. Despite full therapy with antibiotics, neurosurgical interventions, and intensive care support, our patient died due to refractory intracranial hypertension and transtentorial herniation. CONCLUSIONS: Meningitis due to Rothia mucilaginosa is a rare but potentially lethal infection in patients with neutropenia, and evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of this disease are lacking. We suggest an empirical therapy with amoxicillin/rifampicin until adjustments can be made based on an antibiogram.

In this study, we set out to verify the frequency, usefulness, and costs of blood cultures in RSV infections. We addressed the issue by reviewing medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days-121 months, who were hospitalized during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57 patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10 cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1; Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1; Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to $1980. If performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached $5490. In conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection, with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus, blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children hospitalized due to RSV infection."

It is the major bacterial pathogen in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and also causes otitis media and sinusitis. In many cases, treatment is empiric, and there is a lack of understanding of resistance issues with this bacterium. There is little understanding of the epidemiology of H. influenzae respiratory infections, although some strains may be replaced by new strains that cause more severe infections. There is almost no information on how these bacteria may spread in the community. Ampicillin resistance is significant (it may be &gt;30%), and there are few oral agents capable of reducing organism burden. There is little understanding of the epidemiology of H. influenzae respiratory infections, and almost no information on how these bacteria may spread in the community. Recent evidence suggests that these bacteria may behave in a similar way to Streptococcus pneumoniae. If that proves correct, then it will be important to follow these organisms in the community to determine if resistance determinants may spread more widely than we have thus far believed. The implications for treatment, infection prevention and control, and public health should not be underestimated as it has been with other organisms such as S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus."

Of 474 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 469 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 76, Streptococcus pneumoniae 81, Haemophilus influenzae 84, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 56, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 24, etc. Of 76 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were both 38 strains (50.0%). Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Arbekacin also showed the potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125-0.5 microg/mL.

RECENT FINDINGS: With the widespread availability of genetic testing and a greater appreciation of the clinical spectrum of the disease, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is being made with increasing frequency in adults. Clinical features that lead to the diagnosis include respiratory symptoms and chronic airway infection with typical cystic fibrosis pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as nontuberculous mycobacteria. Often these patients have previously received diagnoses of asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. Pancreatic insufficiency is much less common in the adult receiving the diagnosis, but pancreatitis occurs with greater frequency. Occasionally, individuals receive diagnoses of apparent single-organ manifestations such as idiopathic pancreatitis or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, but with negligible involvement of the respiratory tract. On rare occasions, patients receiving the diagnosis as adults can present with classic features of the disease. Although lung disease is generally less severe in cystic fibrosis patients receiving the diagnosis as adults than in adult patients who received the diagnosis as infants, the extent of bronchiectasis can nonetheless be severe. The clinical course of patients receiving a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adulthood is largely unknown, but frequently they have milder disease and a more favorable prognosis. SUMMARY: Clinicians must be aware of the potential for adults with chronic respiratory tract infections, unexplained bronchiectasis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or pancreatitis to have cystic fibrosis despite the age at presentation."

Cases of paranasal sinusitis with severe suppuration are reportedly becoming less frequent, while those of chronic catarrhal paranasal sinusitis and edematous allergic paranasal sinusitis are becoming more so, The primary factor in paranasal sinusitis, a typical infectious disease encountered in otolaryngology, is bacterial infection. The main causative bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, reported in 13.4% of cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 12.8% Moraxella catarrhalis in 5.5%, Staphylococcus aureus in 26.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5.2%, and anaerobes. The incidence of strains resistant to antimicrobial agents has grown for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis and decreased for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Acute exacerbation or severe suppuration in chronic paranasal sinusitis requires the administration of antimicrobial agents, with the same agent administered 2 weeks for maximal effect. First-line agents are AMPC/CVA, SBTPC, CDTR-PI, CFPN-PI, and GFLX for adults, with ASPC, SBPC, ACPC, CTRX, CMZ, FMOX, PAPM/BP, and MEPM injected in severe cases. Attention must be paid to strains that resist cephems and macrolides, such as PISP, PRSP, and BLNAR. In refractory chronic paranasal sinusitis, attention must also be paid to biofilms produced by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Suitable antimicrobial agents should be determined for treating of chronic paranasal sinusitis, in addition to the best procedure to ensure early recovery from inflammation, such as puncturing or irrigating the maxillary sinus, injecting a suitable agent, nebulization, and/or surgically widening the middle meatus."

Revascularization was performed using a 22 mm extruded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) interposition graft placed in situ. This case demonstrates that a high index of suspicion is required in diagnosing infectious aortitis and that the diagnosis may be delayed in many cases. Additionally, it may not be uncommon for the infected aorta to rupture without prior aneurysm formation."

OBSERVATION: We report a case of pneumonia due to PV secreting Staphylococcus aureus in a healthy young adult, complicated by multiple necrotizing lung lesions and major cystic changes, with a favourable final outcome. Acute respiratory failure with haemodynamic failure and ARDS developed a few days after an influenza-like illness. The appearances at fibreoptic bronchoscopy were atypical, consisting of a purulent, necrotic tracheo- bronchitis with desquamation. The initial unfavourable progress despite broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and, finally, the identification of PV leukotoxin in blood cultures and tracheal aspirate, led to the diagnosis. During the clinical course there were repeated pneumothoraces (8 drains) due to multiple bilateral cystic lesions. Ultimately progress was favourable following treatment with antibiotics (flucloxacillin and clindamycin) and steroids. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider pulmonary complications of the Panton-Valentine leukotoxin in a healthy young adult who presents with necrotizing pneumonia and an unfavourable outcome in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics. Treatment is difficult on account of the extent of the necrotizing lesions and the need to use antibiotics effective against both the bacterium and its toxin."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic S. aureus colonization were selected from a total of 50 patients with cystic fibrosis. Sputum samples were cultured according to standard microbiological procedures. Patients were considered to have chronic bronchial colonization if the same microorganism was isolated in 3 consecutive sputum samples, separated by an interval of at least 1 month. The following variables were compared between patients with MSSA (17) and MRSA (8): sex, body mass index, presence of pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial colonization, pulmonary function, Brasfield radiological score, Shwachman clinical score, and number of respiratory exacerbations in the previous year. RESULTS: The prevalence of infection by MRSA was 16%. All the MRSA strains were sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. Patients with MRSA were older and had a larger number of respiratory exacerbations than patients with MSSA. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high percentage of colonization by MRSA in adult cystic fibrosis patients. Although the pathogenic role of this microorganism remains unclear, patients with MRSA had more frequent exacerbations and poorer lung function. Thus, infection control is important and patients should be adequately monitored."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:19659672TITLE:Clinical spectrum of gram-positive infections in lung transplantation.ABSTRACT:PURPOSE: Gram-positive (GP) organisms are among the most common cause of infections in early postsurgical and immunocompromised populations. Patients recovering from lung transplantation (LT) are particularly susceptible owing to the physiologic stress imposed by surgery and induction with intense immunosuppression. Sites, types, and timing of GP infections following LT are not well documented. This report describes the clinical spectrum of GP infections and their effects on surgical airway complications (SAC) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) following LT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data were collected from 202 patients undergoing 208 LT procedures at a single institution between November 1990 and November 2005. Data were retrospectively analyzed according to timing, location, and causative pathogen. RESULTS: In the median follow-up period of 2.7 years (range, 0-13.6 years), 137 GP infections were confirmed in 72 patients. Sites of infection included respiratory tract (42%), blood (27%), skin, wound and catheter (21%), and other (10%). GP pathogens identified were Staphylococcus species (77%), Enterococcus species (12%), Streptococcus species (6%), Pneumococcus (4%), and Eubacterium lentum (1%). The likelihood of SAC and BOS was increased in lung allograft recipients with GP pneumonia as compared with those without (hazard ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval=1.5-3.1). CONCLUSIONS: GP organisms were responsible for infections in 40% of lung allograft recipients and most commonly isolated from the respiratory tract and blood stream. Staphylococcal species were most frequently identified, 42% of which were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Given the strong association of respiratory tract infections with the development of SAC and BOS, empiric antimicrobial strategies after LT should include agents directed against GP organisms, especially MRSA."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:19672827TITLE:[Antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting: update 2009].ABSTRACT:Rational outpatient therapy restricts antibiotics to infections where they are beneficial and selects substances based on local resistance patterns. Respiratory tract infections typically caused by viruses should not be treated with antibiotics (e.g., rhinitis, bronchitis, sinusitis). Many respiratory infections likely caused by bacteria can be treated with aminopenicillin, sometimes combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Quinolones should be used only as exception for respiratory tract infections, since resistance is rising. For this reason uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) should be treated with trimethoprim-sulfa-methoxazole (TMP-SMX) instead of quinolones, even though approximately 20% of Escherichia coli are resistant to TMP-SMX. Skin and soft tissue infections are best treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, as long as the community acquired methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus frequently seen in certain countries remain uncommon here."

The mechanism of refractory cardio-respiratory failure is complex and not clearly delineated. We aimed to examine the clinico-pathological features and suggest how they may be related to outcome, by multi-center review of clinical records and post-mortem findings of 10 patients with fulminant pertussis (FP). All cases were less than 8 weeks of age, and required ventilation for worsening respiratory symptoms and inotropic support for severe hemodynamic compromise. All died or underwent extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) within 1 week. All had increased leukocyte counts (from 54 to 132 x 10(9)/L) with prominent neutrophilia in 9/10. The post-mortem demonstrated necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis with extensive areas of necrosis of the alveolar epithelium. Hyaline membranes were present in those cases with viral co-infection. Pulmonary blood vessels were filled with leukocytes without well-organized thrombi. Immunodepletion of the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes was a common feature. Other organisms were isolated as follows; 2/10 cases Para influenza type 3, 2/10 Moraxella catarrhalis, 1/10 each with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a coliform organism, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and candida tropicalis. We postulate that severe hypoxemia and intractable cardiac failure may be due to the effects of pertussis toxin, necrotizing bronchiolitis, extensive damage to the alveolar epithelium, tenacious airway secretions, and possibly leukostasis with activation of the immunological cascade, all contributing to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Cellular apoptosis appeared to underlay much of these changes. The secondary immuno-compromise may facilitate co-infection."

We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with persistent wheezing, worsening productive cough and sore throat. Computed tomography of the chest revealed the presence of tracheomalacia, confirmed at bronchoscopy. The presence of purulent exudate, coating the trachea and main bronchi, was consistent with bacterial tracheobronchitis. Culture of the tracheal aspirates grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). As the patient was afebrile and not systemically ill, the clinical picture was consistent with exudative tracheobronchitis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of MRSA exudative tracheobronchitis and tracheomalacia in a non-ventilated adult. Other adult cases of bacterial tracheobronchitis and MRSA tracheobronchitis in mechanically ventilated patients reported in the literature are also reviewed.Physicians should be aware of the diagnosis of tracheomalacia in adults, which can masquerade as persistent asthma and may be associated with the development of serious infections including MRSA tracheobronchitis."

Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components--emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment."

It is recognized by the signs of acute- or subacute-onset cough, hemoptysis, diffuse radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and hypoxemic respiratory distress. DAH is characterized by the accumulation of intra-alveolar red blood cells originating most frequently from the alveolar capillaries. It must be distinguished from localized pulmonary hemorrhage, which is most commonly due to chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tumor, or localized infection. Hemoptysis, the major sign of DAH, may develop suddenly or over a period of days to weeks; this sign may also be initially absent, in which case diagnostic suspicion is established after sequential bronchoalveolar lavage reveals worsening red blood cell counts. The causes of DAH can be divided into infectious and noninfectious, the latter of which may affect immunocompetent or immunodeficient patients. Pulmonary infections are rarely reported in association with DAH, but they should be considered in the diagnostic workup because of the obvious therapeutic implications. In immunocompromised patients, the main infectious diseases that cause DAH are cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, invasive aspergillosis, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Strongyloides. In immunocompetent patients, the infectious diseases that most frequently cause DAH are influenza A (H1N1), dengue, leptospirosis, malaria, and Staphylococcus aureus infection. Based on a search of the PubMed and Scopus databases, we review the infectious diseases that may cause DAH in immunocompetent patients."

We analyzed a) the incidence and the outcome of pneumonias caused by different pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a medium-sized twenty-four bed community hospital and b) the incidence of complications of such pneumonias requiring surgical intervention such as thoracotomy and decortication. RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients diagnosed with nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia in our ICU. Their bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum cultures, antibiograms, and other clinical characteristics, including complications and need for tracheostomy, thoracotomy and decortication were studied. In a span of one year (2011-12), 43 patients were diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia in our ICU. The median simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) was 39. One or more gram negative organisms as the causative agents were present in 85% of microbiologic samples. The three most prevalent gram negatives were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (34%), Pseudomonas aeurginosa (40%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (32%). Twenty eight percent of bronchoalveolar samples contained Staphylococcus aureus. Eight three percent of patients required mechanical ventilation postoperatively and 37% underwent tracheostony. Thirty five percent underwent thoracotomy and decortication because of further complications such as empyema and non-resolving parapneumonic effusions. A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia extended spectrum beta lactam (ESBL) and P. aeurginosa had the highest prevalence of multi drug resistance (MDR). Fifteen patients required surgical intervention.

Presence of bacterial infection (defined as &gt;=10(4) colony-forming units/mL) was compared between BAL HAdV(+) and HAdV negative (HAdV(-)) groups. Immune function tests were performed including blood lymphocyte subsets in a random subgroup. RESULTS: Species C HAdVs were identified in 23 of 24 (96%) HAdV(+) children; 13 (57%) were HAdV-1 and 10 (43%) were HAdV-2. An HAdV(+) BAL was significantly associated with bacterial coinfection with Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio [OR], 3.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-7.75; P = .007) and negatively associated with Staphylococcus aureus infection (P = .03). Young age was related to increased rates of HAdV(+). Blood CD16 and CD56 natural killer cells were significantly more likely to be elevated in those with HAdV (80%) compared with those without (56.1%) (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-C is the major HAdV species detected in the lower airways of children with PBB and BE. Younger age appears to be an important risk factor for HAdV(+) of the lower airways and influences the likelihood of bacterial coinfection."

This hospital-based, descriptive study included children aged &lt; or = 16 years, diagnosed with empyema thoracis or parapneumonic pleural effusion, from whom a pleural fluid (PF) sample was taken between January 2008 and November 2009. PF and blood samples were cultured and PF samples were also tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess whether evidence of an infection might be identified among culture-negative samples. Serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae-positive samples was performed by molecular techniques and Quellung reaction. In this study, 29 children with empyema thoracis and 42 children with parapneumonic pleural effusion were enrolled. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were cultured in 13/71 samples at local or central laboratories; the most common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (8 children) and S. pneumoniae (2 children). Molecular techniques detected one or more targeted respiratory pathogens in 18/71 PF samples. S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were identified by PCR in 13 and 6 children, respectively; PCR for S. aureus was not performed. The pneumococcal serotypes identified were 1, 3, 5, 6A/B, 9A/V, 14, 15A, 19F and 23A. This study shows that among Thai children with empyema thoracis and parapneumonic pleural effusions, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were the most common pathogens identified by culture and PCR, respectively. These findings confirmed that molecular techniques are more sensitive for identification of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and enhance detection of important bacterial causes of empyema."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 70 patients aged 1-14 years diagnosed to have empyema thoracis and who underwent tube thoracostomy from January 2010 to December 2013 were studied. All patients of which 12 patients needed decortication. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group was 5.44 years and 48.6% were male and 51.4% were female. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (90%), dyspnoea (73%), cough (70%) and chest pain (23%). Pleural fluid cultures were sterile in 60% of patients. The most frequently identified micro-organisms was Staphylococcus aureus (34.2%). Treatment with chest tube drainage was successful in 55 (78.6%) patients. Three patients got expired. Twelve patients had decortications, all of which were successful. The lung re-expansion time was 8.00 +- 1.68 days (range: 5-13 days) in those patients in whom chest tube drainage was successful, whereas it was 7.50 +- 2.623 days (range: 4-14 days) in patients in whom decortication was done. The post-procedure stay was 10.00 +- 1.809 days (range: 7-15 days) in patients with successful chest tube drainage and 9.5 +- 2.902 days (range: 6-17 days) in case of decortication cases. CONCLUSION: Tube thoracostomy should be done in all cases of empyema thoracis regardless of stage, as this leads to reduction in septic load. Decision of decortication should be taken without any delay."

METHODS: A case series of necrotizing pneumonia presenting as a primary or coprimary infection, secondary to CA-MRSA without evidence of antecedent viral URI, is presented. Cases were identified through the infectious diseases consultation service records. Clinical and radiographic data were collected by chart review and electronic records. MRSA strains were isolated from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, pleural fluid or blood cultures and confirmed using standard laboratory procedures. MRSA strains were characterized by susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing, agr typing and multilocus sequence typing. Testing for respiratory viruses was performed by appropriate serological testing of banked sera, or nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveloar lavage specimens. RESULTS: Ten patients who presented or copresented with CA necrotizing pneumonia secondary to CA-MRSA from April 2004 to October 2011 were identified. The median length of stay was 22.5 days. Mortality was 20.0%. Classical risk factors for CA-MRSA were identified in seven of 10 (70.0%) cases. Chest tube placement occurred in seven of 10 patients with empyema. None of the patients had historical evidence of antecedent URI. In eight of 10 patients, serological or nucleic acid testing testing revealed no evidence of acute viral coinfection. Eight strains were CMRSA-10 (USA300). The remaining two strains were a USA300 genetically related strain and a USA1100 strain. CONCLUSION: Pneumonia secondary to CA-MRSA can occur in the absence of an antecedent URI. Infections due to CA-MRSA are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinicians need to have an awareness of this clinical entity, particularly in patients who are in risk groups that predispose to exposure to this bacterium."

METHODS: The clinical data of 44 pediatric SAP cases in the Children&amp;prime;s Hospital, Chongqing Medical University from January 2008 to December 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-four cases were identified as inhaled SAP, and 20 cases as blood-borne SAP. RESULTS: Inhaled SAP was more common in children younger than 3 years of age, while blood-borne SAP was more prevalent in children older than 6 years of age. Patients with inhaled SAP had significantly higher incidence rates of cough, wheeze, moist rales, dyspnea and empyema than those with blood-borne SAP (P&amp;lt;0.05). The patients with blood-borne SAP were more vulnerable to severe fever, unconsciousness, dysfunction of liver and kidney, pyogenic osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, sepsis, and abscess of skin and soft tissues (P&amp;lt;0.05). Inhaled SAP isolates had significantly higher rates of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, oxacillin, and cefoxitin than blood-borne SAP isolates (P&amp;lt;0.05), while the latter had a higher rate of resistance to cotrimoxazole (P&amp;lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled SAP often occurs in children younger than 3 years of age, and the respiratory manifestations are commonly seen. Blood-borne SAP often occurs in children older than 6 years of age, with the infectious-toxic symptoms that result in multiple organ infection and dysfunction. The isolates of inhaled and blood-borne SAP have different antibiograms."

This was a cross-sectional study carried from February to December 2001. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and venous blood specimens obtained from 108 children with features suggestive of ALRI, were cultured and the isolated bacterial organisms were identified biochemically. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were also tested for Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) antigen using a commercial kit (Becton Dickinson Directigen RSV test kit). A multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was also used to detect and characterize RSV using extracted RNA. Socio-demographic and clinical data were also obtained from the study subjects. Bronchopneumonia (55.5%), bronchiolitis (25%), lobar pneumonia (10.2), non-specific ALRI (4.6%), TB, bronchitis and respiratory distress (0.67%) were diagnosed. The prevalence of septicaemia was 10% and bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enteric bacteria, including Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp and Klebsiella spp, were isolated. Out of the 108 cases, 18% tested positive for RSV, with two cases having RSV as the only aetiological pathogen detected. The subtyping analysis of RSV strains by a multiplex RT-PCR showed that subgroups A and B circulated in the season of analysis. "

The dominant pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae(11/38,29%), Haemophilus influenzae (6/ 38,16%), Moraxella catarrhalis (4/38, 11%), Escherichia coli (4/38, 11%), Candida albicans (4/38, 11%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4/38, 11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (3/38, 8%). (4) The H1a genotype was the only one genotype in the detected sequence of 54 measles virus strains. CONCLUSION: Measles was more often seen in the children under the age of 9 months from the floating population. The morbidity peak month was from April to May in Shanghai. The H1a genotype was the only one genotype. We should try to improve vaccination coverage rate in the children who are at the age for vaccination, so as to prevent measles outbreak."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:26785088TITLE:Pediatric Necrotizing Pneumonia: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.ABSTRACT:Necrotizing pneumonias occur infrequently in children but may be associated with significant morbidity. If not adequately treated, necrotizing pneumonia may lead to complications including bronchopleural fistula, empyema, respiratory failure, and septic shock. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly implicated agent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antimicrobial treatment is the cornerstone of management, although surgical drainage may be required in some cases. We present the case of a 14-month-old child with fever and cough that persisted despite treatment with typical first-line oral antimicrobial therapy. An initial plain radiograph of the chest demonstrated lobar pneumonia. Ultimately, computed tomography of the chest revealed a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. We review the literature and describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, microbiological etiology, and management of necrotizing pneumonia in children."

However the rate of occult bacteremia in infants with RSV infection is not well established. The aim was to determine the actual rate and predictive factors of bacteremia in children admitted to hospital due to confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI), using both conventional culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011-2013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. RESULTS: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2). In those patients with bacteremia, there was a previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection and had received empirical antibiotic treatment 6 out of 7 (85.7%) patients. There were significant differences in terms of severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015); respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value &lt; 0.001); Wood-Downes score (mean = 8.7 vs. 4.8 points, P-value &lt; 0.001); GENVIP scale (mean = 17 vs. 10.1, P-value &lt; 0.001); and length of hospitalization (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Bacteremia is not frequent in infants hospitalized with RSV respiratory infection, however, it should be considered in the most severe cases."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, epidemiological, microbiological, and molecular characteristics of CA-SA pneumonia among children hospitalized in two large tertiary care referral centers during an 8-year period. Cases of CA-SA pneumonia admitted between 2007 and 2014 were retrospectively examined through medical record review. Molecular investigation was performed for available strains; mecA, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) (lukS-lukF-PV), and fibronectin binding protein A (fnbA) genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clones were assigned by agr groups, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), SCCmec, and multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). In total, 41 cases were recorded (boys, 61 %), with a median age of 4.3 months (range, 1-175). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 31 cases (75.6 %). Complications included empyema (25/41, 61 %), pneumatoceles (7/41, 17 %), and lung abscess (1/41, 2.5 %). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required in 58.5 %. Two deaths occurred (4.9 %). Definitive therapy was based on vancomycin with or without other antibiotics (55.9 %), followed by clindamycin and linezolid (26.5 % each). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC90 2 mg/L, range 1-2), teicoplanin, and linezolid, whereas 26.8 % were resistant to clindamycin. Among the 25 studied strains, 20 were mecA-positive (MRSA), carrying also the fnbA gene. Of these, 90 % belonged to the ST80-IV/agr3/PVL-positive clone. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains showed polyclonality, 3/5 were PVL-positive, and 3/5 were fnbA-positive. MRSA and particularly the ST80-IV clone predominated among staphylococcal pneumonia cases in children. Treatment provided was effective in all but two patients, despite the relatively high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin and a high resistance to clindamycin. "

The role of conventional and molecular microbiological tests.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: An increasing incidence of parapneumonic effusion and pleural empyema (PPE/PE) has been reported in recent studies. As only few data on etiology of PPE/PE in Central Europe have been reported, we undertook a study on the etiology of PPE/PE in children, using both standard culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between June 2011 and December 2013. Consecutive children with PPE/PE complicating community acquired pneumonia, who required diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis were included. Blood and pleural fluid samples for microbiological cultures were collected. Molecular methods were applied to identify Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses in pleural fluid. RESULTS: The study group included 64 children, median age 4 (1-15). Seven of 64 (10.9%) blood cultures and 11 of 64 (17.2%) pleural fluid cultures revealed bacterial growth. The most common bacteria detected was S. pneumoniae (13 blood and pleural fluid samples from 11/64 (17.2%) children). DNA sequences of typical bacteria were found in 29/64 (45.3%) pleural fluid samples. S. pneumoniae was identified in 90% of these samples. The most common serotypes were: serotype 6B in 9/26 (36.6%), 19A in 6/26 (23%), serotype 3 in 3/26 (11.5%), 6A and 23F (both in 2/26 i.e. 7.7%) patients. Molecular methods identified atypical bacteria in 8/58 (13.8%) and respiratory viruses in 12/58 (20.7%) pleural fluid samples. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, in particular serotype 6B and 19A, is the most common etiologic agent of PPE/PE in Polish children. The use of PCR significantly improves pathogen identification in pleural fluid."

We retrospectively investigated the characteristics of hospitalizations due to pulmonary infection in patients with IPF to elucidate causative pathogens and mortality. We reviewed patients with IPF who were admitted between January 2008 and December 2014 for pulmonary infections including pneumonia and bronchitis. The causative pathogen, the relationship between the site of pneumonia and existing IPF radiological patterns on high-resolution chest CT, and predictors of mortality were evaluated. Forty-eight IPF patients were hospitalized a totally of 81 times due to pulmonary infection during the study period. In the 48 first-time admissions after IPF diagnosis, causative pathogens were detected in 20 patients (41.6%). The most common pathogen was Haemophilus influenzae (14.5%) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.1%), Branhamella catarrhalis (4.1%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%). Among all 81 admissions, the most common pathogen was P. aeruginosa (12.3%), followed by H. influenzae (8.6%), S. aureus (6.1%) and Escherichia coli (4.9%). No relationship was observed between the detected pathogen and the site of pneumonia. The 30-day and hospital mortality rates were 14.5% and 18.7%, respectively. Pneumonia severity index on admission was significantly associated with both 30-day and hospital mortality. In conclusion, IPF patients hospitalized for pulmonary infections had high 30-day and hospital mortality. In contrast to community-acquired pneumonia, the causative pathogens mainly consisted of gram-negative bacteria. The PSI score may be a significant predictor of mortality. These results provide information for empiric antibiotic selection when treating IPF patients with pulmonary infections."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and diagnostic performance of the LAMP eazyplex MRSA test for the direct detection and differentiation of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in synovial/pleural fluid. METHODS: Analytical validation included the determination of the limit of detection (LoD) and analytical specificity of the eazyplex MRSA test. A diagnostic evaluation of the eazyplex test against bacterial culture was performed on routine pleural/synovial samples collected prospectively from patients aged less than 18 years with complicated pneumonia with empyema or arthritis admitted to the Children's Hospital Sant Joan de Deu in Barcelona, Spain, between April 2015 and May 2016. RESULTS: The new system appropriately detected a quality control panel of clinical samples with DNA of MSSA, MRSA, and other pathogens. The LoD was established at 6.4x103 CFU/ml for S. aureus and 1.0x104 CFU/ml for MRSA. Diagnostic validation of the eazyplex MRSA assay was performed on 51 prospective clinical invasive samples, resulting in sensitivity and specificity values of 83.3% and 97.8%, respectively, for S. aureus detection. The mean turnaround time was 70min. CONCLUSIONS: The eazyplex MRSA assay was found to be a useful test for the rapid detection of S. aureus in invasive samples such as pleural/synovial fluid."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:28770121TITLE:Necrotizing pneumonia: an emerging problem in children?ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: In children, necrotizing pneumonia (NP) is an uncommon, severe complication of pneumonia. It is characterized by destruction of the underlying lung parenchyma resulting in multiple small, thin-walled cavities and is often accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae. REVIEW: NP in children was first reported in children in 1994, and since then there has been a gradual increase in cases, which is partially explained by greater physician awareness and use of contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, and by temporal changes in circulating respiratory pathogens and antibiotic prescribing. The most common pathogens detected in children with NP are pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood, but likely relate to multiple host susceptibility and bacterial virulence factors, with viral-bacterial interactions also possibly having a role. Most cases are in previously healthy young children who, despite adequate antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia, remain febrile and unwell. Many also have evidence of pleural effusion, empyema, or pyopneumothorax, which has undergone drainage or surgical intervention without clinical improvement. The diagnosis is generally made by chest imaging, with CT scans being the most sensitive, showing loss of normal pulmonary architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and multiple thin-walled cavities. Blood culture and culture and molecular testing of pleural fluid provide a microbiologic diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases. Prolonged antibiotics, draining pleural fluid and gas that causes mass effects, and maintaining ventilation, circulation, nutrition, fluid, and electrolyte balance are critical components of therapy. Despite its serious nature, death is uncommon, with good clinical, radiographic and functional recovery achieved in the 5-6 months following diagnosis. Increased knowledge of NP's pathogenesis will assist more rapid diagnosis and improve treatment and, ultimately, prevention. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider that our understanding of NP is limited to individual case reports or small case series, and treatment data from randomized-controlled trials are lacking. Furthermore, case series are retrospective and usually confined to single centers. Consequently, these studies may not be representative of patients in other locations, especially when allowing for temporal changes in pathogen behaviour and differences in immunization schedules and antibiotic prescribing practices."

In spite of recent advances in management, there is paucity of data on clinical, aetiological profile of severe and very severe pneumonia among under five-year-old children in developing countries. Aim: To determine the clinico-aetiological factors of severe and very severe pneumonia and its outcome in children aged two -months to five-years in a tertiary health care centre in Odisha, India. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective observational study. All the patients between two-months to five-years age admitted to SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha, India, were screened for features of severe and very severe pneumonia based on WHO diagnostic criteria, over a one year period. Out of 10300 patients admitted to our hospital during the study period; 141 cases were included in the study. Their clinical parameters were recorded and were followed up till discharge or death. Continous variables were analyzed using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test whereas categorical data were analyzed using Pearson Chi square test or Fischer Exact test. Results: Out of 141 patients included in the study, cough, tachypnea and chest retractions were present in 100% cases while fever in 97.1% (137) cases. In 17% (24) cases, bacterial pathogen was isolated. Most common organism being Staphylococcus aureus 8.51% (12) followed by Streptococcus pneumonie 6.4% (9). Higher mortality 11.34% (16) was found among patients presenting after three days of illness (p=0.048). About 17% (24) patients developed complications. Common complications were sepsis 5.6% (8), CCF 4.2% (6) and empyema 4.2% (6). Higher mortality 22 (15.6%) was observed in very severe pneumonia group (p=0.003). Conclusion: The incidence of severe and very severe pneumonia was higher in infancy. Rainy and winter season were associated with higher incidence of disease. Bottle feeding practice and smoking were significantly associated with more severe disease. Death rate was high among patients admitted to hospital after three days of onset of illness, so early referral is indicated for better outcome."

The efficacy of aerosolized vancomycin (AV) in treating VAT has not been clearly demonstrated. METHODS: Four mechanically ventilated patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia were treated with an additional AV. AV (250 mg twice per day) was administered through a vibrating mesh device for 5 days. All patients were receiving intravenous vancomycin and had severe tracheobronchitis, based on bronchoscopic findings before or soon after additional AV treatment. RESULTS: After several days of AV treatment, follow-up bronchoscopies showed dramatic improvement of tracheobronchitis. All patients achieved microbiological eradication of MRSA. Finally, two of four patients survived through to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This case series study suggests a potential role of AV in the treatment of MRSA tracheobronchitis, which were accompanied by VAP. Clinical trial addressing the efficacy of AV in MRSA VAT and/or VAP should be needed."

The purpose of this study is to better characterize the bacteriology and demographics in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring surgery for empyema. All patients diagnosed with empyema preoperatively and had either a video-assisted thoracoscopic or open decortication surgery from January 2010 to September 2015 were reviewed. Forty-seven patients were identified with a mean age of 54.7 +- 16.8 years (X +- SD). Sixty per cent of patients had CAP. Anaerobes were the most common isolate at 21 per cent, followed by Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus (50% Methicillin Resistant). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were the next most frequent at 13 per cent. Hospital-acquired pneumonia patients had a higher incidence of S. aureus infections (P = 0.047). Cancer history had higher rates of both fungal (P = 0.004) and gram-negative infections (P = 0.03). Older patients had increased incidence of gram-negative infections (P = 0.05). The median length of stay for CAP patient who were intravenous drug abusers (n = 3) were 31 days (95% confidence interval (CI) [15, NA]), which was significantly longer than the others (median 12 days, 95% CI: [9, 18], P = 0.014). Streptococcus pneumoniae was not found in any of the isolates. Our data reveal that anaerobes and Staphylococcus species have replaced S. pneumoniae as the major regional pathogens in surgically treated empyema.

A 29-year-old man presented to the hospital with fever and chills a few days after an inadvertent needle stick while injecting heroin. His left forearm was warm with an area of fluctuance. He underwent incision and drainage of the left forearm abscess with fluid submitted for Gram stain and culture. His condition rapidly deteriorated due to sepsis, and he required transfer to the intensive care unit. A new 4 x 3 cm area over the left pectoralis muscle had become increasingly indurated, fluctuant, and erythematous. CT of the chest demonstrated extensive cavitary lung lesions and a large loculated left-sided pleural effusion with extension through the chest wall. TEE revealed a 3 cm complex lesion on the superior septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The patient underwent incision and drainage of the pectoralis major EN with placement of a drain. Blood and sputum cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at which time antibiotic therapy was tailored to oxacillin. Our case highlights a rare occurrence of EN due to MSSA in a patient with intravenous drug use (IDU) and underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment."

Antibiotic management decisions are made on the basis of little available data and without strong specific recommendations in guidelines. METHODS: This was an online survey of paediatric infectious diseases (PID) physicians disseminated by major international professional organisations, examining empiric and targeted antibiotic choice, switch to oral antibiotics and duration of treatment for two hypothetical cases of contrasting severity. RESULTS: This study included 183 responses, mostly from North America, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Increased disease severity was significantly associated with broader-spectrum and combination empiric and targeted antibiotic treatment, empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage and both longer intravenous (IV) and total duration of antibiotic treatment. Empirical MRSA coverage was also associated with local prevalence. Clinical progress was most important for determining the timing of the switch from IV to oral antibiotics. Few respondents chose antibiotics with activity against organisms associated with atypical pneumonia (e.g. Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), and most did not choose agents that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g. clindamycin), even in the case of a severe invasive group A streptococcal infection. Some variation in targeted treatment choices reflected areas of uncertainty, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility breakpoints, comparative effectiveness of anti-staphylococcal penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins for serious S. aureus infections and linezolid and vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This international survey of PID physicians highlights the priority targets for clinical research to improve antibiotic treatment of CAP complicated by empyema. Interventions that might be studied include empirical antibiotic guidelines stratified by case severity, adjunctive empirical use of agents that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g. clindamycin) and approaches to encourage rapid IV-to-oral switch and shorter total antibiotic treatment."

Epidemiological and outcome data of pleural infection in adult Australians are lacking. We describe the bacteriology and clinical outcomes of Australian adults with culture-positive pleural infection (CPPI) over a 6-year period. METHODS: Cases with CPPI were identified through Western Australian public hospitals electronic record. Culture isolates, admission dates, vital status, co-morbidities, radiology, blood and pleural fluid tests were extracted. RESULTS: In total, 601 cases (71.4% males; median age: 63 years (IQR: 50-74); median hospital stay 13 days) involving 894 bacterial isolates were identified. Hospital-acquired (HA)-CPPI was defined in 398 (66.2%) cases, community-acquired (CA)-CPPI in 164 (27.3%) cases and the remaining classified as oesophageal rupture/leak. Co-morbidities, most frequently cancer, were common (65.2%). Radiological evidence of pneumonia was present in only 43.8% of CA-CPPI and 27.3% of HA-CPPI. Of the 153 different bacterial strains cultured, Streptococcus species (32.9%) especially viridans streptococci group were most common in CA-CPPI, whereas HA-CPPI was most often associated with Staphylococcus aureus (11.6%) and Gram-negative (31.9%) infections. Mortality was high during hospitalization (CA-CPPI 13.4% vs HA-CPPI 16.6%; P = 0.417) and at 1 year (CA-CPPI 32.4% vs HA-CPPI 45.5%; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: This is the first large multicentre epidemiological study of pleural infection in Australian adults and includes the largest cohort of HA-CPPI published to date. CPPI is caused by a diverse range of organisms which vary between CA and HA sources. CPPI is a poor prognostic indicator both in the short term and in the subsequent 12 months."

METHOD: We evaluated a group of patients treated for pleural empyema in the Department of Surgery, University Hospital in Pilsen, during the period 2007-2016. We focused on the demographic data of this group, the causes of empyema in these patients, surgical procedures performed in connection with empyema, the microbial species found in empyema, and, last but not least, on morbidity and lethality. RESULTS: We treated 103 patients with pleural empyema during the above period - 80 men (77.7%) and 23 women (22.3%) aged 23-83 years (average age 59.4 years). 64 patients had a history of surgical or invasive procedure (62.1%). The length of history was traceable in 55 patients (53.4%) and was 23.1 days on average, remaining unclear in the rest of the group. 1/3 of cases were metapneumonic empyemas, 1/3 postoperative empyemas and 1/3 of the cases were due to other reasons. The most commonly cultivated bacterial genus was Streptococcus, species Staphylococcus aureus. The most common surgery was chest drainage (51%). 13 patients died (lethality 12.6%) after surgery, the most common cause of death being sepsis; postoperative morbidity was 34%. CONCLUSION: Pleural empyema is a serious condition with very high morbidity and lethality. Surgical procedures done to manage empyema are associated with a very high risk of necessary reoperation. Positive mycological culture from empyema seems to be associated with a higher risk of complications and death.

Over recent years, the frequency of pleural empyema has increased in children with influenza infection. We present a severe case of acute empyema caused by S.pyogenes after influenza A infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 39-year old woman was diagnosed as influenza A and received oral Oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. She had no vaccination of influenza A. Although her influenza A infection improved, she complained of fever and cough to our institute. Chest radiography showed encapsulated pleural effusion of the left lung and pleural effusion which was consistent with acute empyema. Then, she was diagnosed as having acute empyema and was admitted to our institute. Streptococcus pyogenes was identified by pleural fluid culture on day 4. thus, MNZ was changed to clindamycin (CLDM) 600 mg three times a day. While thoracic drainage with intrapleural urokinase and combination antibiotic therapy of ceftriaxone and CLDM were performed, her general condition and chest radiographic findings were not improved. She received video-assisted thoracic debridement on day 10. After the operation, the antibiotic therapy was changed to ABPC 6 g daily iv. Due to good clinical course, the antibiotic therapy was switched to oral amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily on day 28. Then, she was discharged. CONCLUSION: Influenza A virus infection could lead to severe GAS infection, while the latter can occur in otherwise healthy individual as well.

While there are not universally agreed upon criteria, the diagnosis can be made in patients with the appropriate risk factors and clinical scenario, in addition to a radiographic or an ultrasonographic image of pneumonia in the typical dependent lung segment. Treatment options for aspiration pneumonia vary based on the site of acquisition (community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [CAAP] versus healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia [HCAAP]), the risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and severity of illness. Hospitalized CAAP patients without severe illness and with no risk for MDR organisms or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) can be treated with standard inpatient community-acquired pneumonia therapy covering anaerobes. Patients with CAAP and either of the following-risk factors for MDR pathogens, septic shock, need for an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation-can be considered for broader coverage against anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and PA. Severe aspiration pneumonia that originates in a long-term care facility or HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms should be considered for similar treatment. HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms or PA, plus septic shock, need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation should receive double coverage for PA in addition to coverage for MRSA and anaerobes. Multiple gaps in current understanding and management of aspiration pneumonia require future research, with a particular focus on antibiotic stewardship."

CONCLUSION: The pathogen causing the lung abscess is not always compatible with that causing the endocarditis. Thoracoscopic incision of the abscess with 4 to 6 weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is effective and safe."

OBJECTIVE: To provide an update of the literature on patients meeting criteria for HCAP between 2014 and 2018. SOURCES: The review is based on a systematic literature search using PubMed-Central full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM). CONTENT: Studies compared clinical characteristics of patients with HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). HCAP patients were older and had a higher comorbidity. Mortality rates in HCAP varied from 5% to 33%, but seemed lower than those cited in the initial reports. Criteria behind the HCAP classification differed considerably within populations. Microbial patterns differed in that there was a higher incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and, to a lesser extent, enterobacteriaceae. Definitions and rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pneumonia also varied considerably. Broad-spectrum guideline-concordant treatment did not reduce mortality in four observational studies. The HCAP criteria performed poorly as a predictive tool to identify MDR pneumonia or pathogens not covered by treatment for CAP. A new score (Drug Resistance in Pneumonia, DRIP) outperformed HCAP in the prediction of MDR pathogens. Comorbidity and functional status, but not different microbial patterns, seem to account for increased mortality. IMPLICATIONS: HCAP should no longer be used to identify patients at risk of MDR pathogens. The use of validated predictive scores along with implementation of de-escalation strategies and careful individual assessment of comorbidity and functional status seem superior strategies for clinical management."

Pneumonia of polymicrobial aetiology predicts worse pathology with fulminating clinical course. Reports of necrotising pneumonia from multiple bacterial infections are scanty in published literature. We report a case of a toddler with NP in whom Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus, two pathogens which are well documented in its aetiopathogenesis, were isolated concurrently from his sputum and blood. Severe pneumonia, which shows slow response to recommended antibiotics treatment, should raise the suspicion of NP and possibly one of the polymicrobial origins. Even in resource-constrained settings, prompt institution of antibiotics and supportive care can result in resolution of pulmonary lesions."

Device-associated infections (DAIs) are a major threat to patient safety. Aim: To measure DAI rates in ICUs. Methods: Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and catheter- associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) were assessed in the ICUs of 4 tertiary-care teaching hospitals in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Results: The incidence rate of CLABSI, VAP and CAUTI was 10.20, 21.08 and 7.42 per 1000 device-days, respectively. The utilization ratio for central lines, ventilators and urinary catheters was 0.62, 0.47, and 0.84, respectively. The most common organisms were Acinetobacter (33.5 %) and Klebsiella (19.0 %). Sixty to eighty percent of Enterobacteriaceae were extended- spectrum beta-lactamase producing. About half of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to piperacillin/ tazobactam and carbapenem. Acinetobacter resistance rate to ampicillin/sulbactam and carbapenem was 70-80 %. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was 84.6 % and 83.3 %, respectively. Conclusions: This study showed high incidence rates of DAIs and resistant organisms, and appropriate interventions are necessary to reduce these rates."

On subsequent investigations, he was diagnosed with empyema thoracis secondary to Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-toxin positive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient was treated with prolonged antibiotics and pleural drainage, and he remained haemodynamically stable throughout hospital admission. PVL is a cytolytic exotoxin produced by some strains of S. aureus Such strains often cause recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, usually in previously fit and healthy individuals. Less commonly, invasive infections occur; these carry a high mortality rate if associated with necrotising pneumonia or septic shock. PVL genes are present in approximately 2% of clinical isolates of S. aureus in the UK. PVL-producing MRSA infections are on the rise and present significant clinical and public health challenges."

We searched the literature to establish whether PCV13 reduces PnPE, and to identify other pathogens causing pleural empyemas (PEs). Material and methods: From October 2005 to January 2018 (12.3 years) we performed active surveillance for all cases of PE at the General Hospital of Tijuana, Mexico. Isolates from pleural fluid (PF) were identified by conventional culture, and since 2014, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was added for all culture-negative PFs. Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes were detected by either Quellung reaction (Statens Serum Institute ) or PCR. Clinical, imagenological, laboratorial and microbiological evaluation was performed on each patient. Statistical analysis was purely descriptive. Results: A total of 64 PEs were identified (5.28/year). Median age was 51 months (1-191), hospitalization days 18 (4-35). Decortication was performed in 42%, and two children died (3.2%). Bacterial identification was obtained from 51 (80%). S. pneumoniae was the leading cause (29 = 56.8%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14 = 27.4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3-5 = 9%) and others (5 = 9.8%). PCV13 was initiated in May 2012, and its impact on serotype-specific PnPE was 81% (much fewer than serotype 3) and for all PnPE 56.1%; however, for all PE -2.1% due to an increase of PE caused by S. aureus for all but one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Conclusions: Following 12.3 years of active surveillance, PCV13 has shown impact on both serotype-specific and all PnPEs; however, an increase of PEs by MRSA has emerged. Continuous surveillance is crucial to establish whether this epidemiological finding is transitory or not."

While culture-based studies have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens for identifying lower airway infection, none have used both together. We compared respiratory bacterial pathogens cultured from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures as the ""gold standard"" to better inform the diagnosis of lower airway infection in children with chronic wet cough. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and BAL fluid specimens were collected concurrently from consecutive children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for chronic cough and cultured for bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: In cultures from 309 children (median age, 2.3 years) with chronic endobronchial suppuration, all main pathogens detected (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were more prevalent in nasopharyngeal than oropharyngeal swabs (37%, 34%, and 23% vs 21%, 6.2%, and 3.2%, respectively). Positive and negative predictive values for lower airway infection by any of these three pathogens were 63% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 55, 70) and 85% (95% CI, 78, 91) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 65% (95% CI, 54, 75), and 66% (95% CI, 59, 72) for oropharyngeal swabs, and 61% (95% CI, 54,68), and 88% (95% CI, 81, 93) for both swabs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neither nasopharyngeal nor oropharyngeal swabs, alone or in combination, reliably predicted lower airway infection in children with chronic wet cough. Although upper airway specimens may be useful for bacterial carriage studies and monitoring antimicrobial resistance, their clinical utility in pediatric chronic lung disorders of endobronchial suppuration is limited."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the usefulness of sputum Gram stain for defining the etiologic diagnosis of CAP in adult patients. METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline, Embase, Science Direct, Scopus and LILACS databases for full-text articles. Relevant studies were reviewed by at least three investigators who extracted the data, pooled them using a random effects model, and carried out quality assessment. For each bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli), pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were reported. RESULTS: After a review of 3539 abstracts, 20 articles were included in the present meta-analysis. The studies included yielded 5619 patients with CAP. Pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity of sputum Gram stain were 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.62) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86-0.89) respectively for S. pneumoniae, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72-0.84) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.97) for H. influenzae, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.87) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99) for S. aureus, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.49-0.77) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-0.99) for Gram-negative bacilli.

Methods: We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy and safety of antibiotics used to treat inpatients with complicated skin and soft structure infections (cSSSI) or hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). We also developed a decision tree model to assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. Results: Forty-nine randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria (34 for cSSSI, 15 for HAP/VAP) and compared the efficacy and safety of 16 antibiotics. For cSSSI, NMA indicated that for clinical cure, linezolid was superior than vancomycin (odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-2.02), while tedizolid (OR 1.39, CI 0.70-2.76) was similar to vancomycin. In terms of safety, there were no significant differences between any two interventions on total adverse events. Based on drug and hospital costs in America, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per life-year saved for linezolid and tedizolid compared with vancomycin were US$2833 and US$5523. For HAP/VAP, there were no significant effects either for clinical cure or for safety endpoints between linezolid and vancomycin in NMA. ICERs per life-year saved for linezolid compared with vancomycin were US$2185. Conclusion: In these clinical trials, considering efficacy, safety, and cost-effectivenes, linezolid and tedizolid showed their superiority in MRSA cSSSI; while linezolid might be recommended to treat MRSA pneumonia. Although vancomycin was not cost-effective in pharmacoeconomic evaluation, it is still the first-line treatment for MRSA infection in the clinical practice. This study might provide new insights of therapeutic choices for patients with MRSA infections whilst awaiting the arrival of higher quality evidence."

Different management approaches exist for this condition. We evaluated a 14-day treatment with amoxicillin (AMX) with/without clavulanic acid (AMC) confirmed or modified by microbiological findings from pleural tap. Children &lt;=16 years of age with radiologically diagnosed PPE/PE and initial diagnostic pleural tap were included at University Children's Hospital Zurich from 2001-2015. AMX/AMC was given for 14 days and rationalized according to microbiological pleural tap results. Clinical and radiological follow-up was scheduled until six months or full recovery. In 114 of 147 (78%) children with PPE/PE a pathogen was identified by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or antigen testing. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 90 (79%), S. pyogenes in 13 (11%), and Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases (6%), all but two cultured pathogens (96%) were sensitive to AMX/AMC. One-hundred two of 147 (69%) patients received treatment with AMX/AMC for 14 days. They recovered more rapidly than patients with a different management (p = 0.026). Of 139 children with follow-up, 134 (96%) patients fully recovered. In conclusion, 14-day AMX/AMC treatment confirmed and rarely modified by microbiological findings from pleural tap resulted in full recovery in &gt;95% of children with PPE/PE."

The purpose of this study was to access the bacterial cause of LRTIs in patients in Cameroon by two methods. Methods. Participants with LRTIs were enrolled in the referral centre for respiratory diseases in Yaounde city and its surroundings. To detect bacteria, specimens were tested by conventional bacterial culture and a commercial reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. One hundred forty-one adult patients with LRTIs were enrolled in the study. Among the participants, 46.8% were positive for at least one bacterium. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most detected bacteria with 14.2% (20/141) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9.2% (13/141), Staphylococcus aureus, 7.1% (10/141), and Moraxella catarrhalis, 4.3% (6/141). Bacterial coinfection accounted for 23% (14/61) with Haemophilus influenzae being implicated in 19.7% (12/61). The diagnostic performance of RT-PCR for bacteria detection (43.3%) was significantly different from that of culture (17.7%) (p&lt; 0.001). Only Streptococcus pneumoniae detection was associated with empyema by RT-PCR (p&lt;0.001). These findings enhance understanding of bacterial aetiologies in order to improve respiratory infection management and treatment.

We conducted a prospective and single-center observational study among patients with chronic tracheostomy admitted for planned respiratory assessment between February 2015 and December 2016. Data were collected from patient interview and medical charts with a standardized questionnaire. A tracheal aspiration was performed for each patient. Humidifiers were analysed for bacteriological contamination. Overall 77 tracheal aspirates (TA) were obtained from patients included. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 90% of cases (69/77) with a majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32/77, 41%), Staphylococcus aureus (34/77, 44%) and Serratia marcesens. (22/79, 38%) Amoxicillin + Clavulanic-acid and Cefotaxime were adapted for respectively in only 28% and 35% of the subjects due to the natural resistance of organisms. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from humidifier samples. Risk factors significantly associated with P. aeruginosa colonization were residence in a medical-care home (p = 0.01, OR = 3.8 [1.1; 15.1]) and the presence of a cuff (p = 0.003, OR = 4.4 [1.1; 20.6]). Significant quantities of pathogenic bacteria are frequently isolated from TA of tracheostomised patients in the absence of infection. The frequent resistance of these pathogens to Amoxicillin + Clavulanic-acid precludes the use of this antibiotic in the empiric treatment of pneumonia in this population."

Objectives: To compare the causes, treatment, and outcomes of pneumonia in patients with and without AUD and to understand the associations of comorbid illnesses, alcohol withdrawal, and any residual effects due to alcohol itself with patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 137 496 patients 18 years or older with pneumonia who were admitted to 177 US hospitals participating in the Premier Healthcare Database from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2015. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 27, 2017, to August 20, 2018. Exposure: Alcohol use disorders identified from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pneumonia cause, antibiotic treatment, inpatient mortality, clinical deterioration, length of stay, and cost. Associations of AUD with these variables were studied using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Of 137 496 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (70 358 women and 67 138 men; mean [SD] age, 69.5 [16.2] years), 3.5% had an AUD. Patients with an AUD were younger than those without an AUD (median age, 58.0 vs 73.0 years; P &lt; .001), more often male (77.3% vs 47.8%; P &lt; .001), and more often had principal diagnoses of aspiration pneumonia (10.9% vs 9.8%; P &lt; .001), sepsis (38.6% vs 30.7%; P &lt; .001), or respiratory failure (9.3% vs 5.5%; P &lt; .001). Their cultures more often grew Streptococcus pneumoniae (43.7% vs 25.5%; P &lt; .001) and less frequently grew organisms resistant to guideline-recommended antibiotics (25.0% vs 43.7%; P &lt; .001). Patients with an AUD were treated more often with piperacillin-tazobactam (26.2% vs 22.5%; P &lt; .001) but equally as often with anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents (32.9% vs 31.8%; P = .11) compared with patients without AUDs. When adjusted for demographic characteristics and insurance, AUD was associated with higher mortality (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.25-1.56), length of stay (risk-adjusted geometric mean ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27), and costs (risk-adjusted geometric mean ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.28-1.38). After additional adjustment for differences in comorbidities and risk factors for resistant organisms, AUD was no longer associated with mortality but remained associated with late mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.46), length of stay (risk-adjusted geometric mean ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06), and costs (risk-adjusted geometric mean ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09). Models segregating patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal showed that poorer outcomes among patients with AUD were confined to the subgroup undergoing alcohol withdrawal. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that, compared with hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia but without AUD, those with AUD less often harbor resistant organisms. The higher age-adjusted risk of death among patients with AUD appears to be largely attributable to differences in comorbidities, whereas greater use of health care resources may be attributable to alcohol withdrawal."

However, its use to treat infections caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is controversial given limited evidence of its clinical efficacy. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone with either ceftaroline or ceftobiprole in the treatment of pneumonia caused by MSSA. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing clinical cure in patients with pneumonia who received ceftriaxone versus those who received either ceftaroline or ceftobiprole was conducted. Patients who received ceftriaxone plus vancomycin were excluded. The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases as well as clinical trial registries were searched up to 8 June 2018. Risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model and assessing for heterogeneity (I2). A total of five RCTs met the inclusion criteria; four used ceftaroline and one used ceftobiprole. Four studies included adults and one included paediatric patients. The adult studies included non-intensive care unit patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia. Clinical cure was statistically lower with ceftriaxone (RD, -28.5%, 95% CI -53.5% to -3.4%; P = 0.026; I2 = 16.321%) than with ceftaroline or ceftobiprole. In conclusion, ceftriaxone use was associated with higher clinical failure of MSSA pneumonia compared with ceftaroline or ceftobiprole. This supports the notion that ceftriaxone is not an ideal agent for the treatment of MSSA infections and adds new evidence against its use for MSSA pneumonia."

However, few studies have evaluated the rate of nasal carriage of MRSA and its effect on SSIs in patients undergoing general thoracic surgery. We investigated the importance of preoperative screening for nasal carriage of MRSA in patients undergoing general thoracic surgery. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 238 patients with thoracic diseases who underwent thoracic surgery. We reviewed the rates of nasal carriage of MRSA and SSIs. Results: Results of MRSA screening were positive in 11 of 238 patients (4.6%), and 9 of these 11 patients received nasal mupirocin. SSIs occurred in 4 patients (1.8%). All 4 patients developed pneumonia; however, MRSA pneumonia occurred in only 1 of these 4 patients. No patient developed wound infection, empyema, and/or mediastinitis. SSIs did not occur in any of the 11 patients with positive results on MRSA screening. Conclusions: The rates of nasal carriage of MRSA and SSIs were low in this case series. Surveillance is important to determine the prevalence of MRSA carriage and infection in hospitals, particularly in the intensive care unit. However, routine preoperative screening for nasal carriage of MRSA is not recommended in patients undergoing general thoracic surgery."

Studies focusing on S. aureus pneumonia in DM is limited, we sought to make a relatively comprehensive exploration of clinical characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, and risk factors for mortality of S. aureus pneumonia in DM and non-diabetics mellitus (non-DM). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in Ruijin Hospital from 2014 to 2017. The characteristics of DM and non-DM patients were assessed, including demographics, comorbidities, using of invasive mechanical ventilation, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age &gt;=65 years (CURB-65) score, length of hospital stay, clinical outcomes, antimicrobial susceptibility. Independent risk factors for mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 patients with S. aureus pneumonia were included in our study, including 144 with DM and 221 non-DM. DM patients were more susceptible to MRSA infection (65.3% vs. 56.1%, P &gt; 0.05), suffered from much severer pneumonia with a higher CURB-65 score, invasive mechanical ventilation rate (46.5% vs. 28.1%, P &lt; 0.01) and mortality rates (30.6% vs. 23.1%, P &gt; 0.05); almost all DM patients had higher antimicrobial resistance than non-DM patients, the DM group had a higher co-infection rate (47.2% vs. 45.7%, P &gt; 0.05), and Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common bacterium in DM, while Klebsiella pneumoniae ranked first in patients with non-DM. Independent risk factors for pneumonia-related mortality were MRSA and CURB-65. Higher HbA1c levels were linked to a higher MRSA infection and co-infection rate and more severe pneumonia, leading to an increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: DM patients with poor glucose control are more susceptible to MRSA infection. They suffer from higher antimicrobial resistance, a higher co-infection rate, and much severer pneumonia than non-DM. MRSA itself is an independent risk factor for mortality in all patients."

Methods: A retrospective, observational study of 52 necrotizing pneumonia (NP) cases who were hospitalized in our hospital from January 2008 to December 2017 was conducted. According to the pathogen causing NP, patients were divided into two groups, BNP and MPNP, and the clinical manifestations, laboratory data, imaging findings, hospital course and prognosis between these groups were analyzed. Results: This study enrolled 19 boys and 33 girls, and the median ages of patients were 4.4 (0.1-13.8) years old. Of the totally of 52 NP patients, 19 were in the BNP group (9 boys and 10 girls), 33 were in the MPNP group (10 boys and 23 girls). The mean age of MPNP patients was much older than that of BNP patients (5.2 (2.3-13.2) years vs. 1.8 (0.1-13.8) years, Z=-0.128, P&lt;0.01). The number of patients with tachypnea and pleural effusion septation were significantly higher in BNP patients than those in MPNP patients (15 cases vs. 4 cases, chi(2)=23.222, P&lt;0.01; 14 cases vs. 1 case, chi(2)=29.326, P&lt;0.01), which more needed to oxygentherapy (18 cases vs. 12 cases, chi(2)=16.833, P&lt;0.01) and undergo chest drainage (9 cases vs. 4 cases, chi(2)=5.829, P=0.022); while the number of patients required bronchoalveolar lavage was higher in MPNP patients than that in BNP patients (5 cases vs. 32 cases, chi(2)=29.326, P&lt;0.01). The values of white blood cell (WBC) (23.2 (5.2-67.1)x10(9)/L vs. 9.7 (6.3-18.7)x10(9)/L, Z=-4.855, P&lt;0.01), procalcitonin (PCT) (3.69 (0.23-90.15) mg/L vs. 0.28 (0.02-1.44) mg/L, Z=-3.207, P=0.001), C reactive protein (CRP) (160 (94-220) mg/L vs. 90 (5-134) mg/L, Z=-4.337, P&lt;0.01), interleukin (IL)-10 (11.7 (4.2-401.5) ng/L vs. 4.8 (2.0-23.4) ng/L, Z=-2.278, P=0.023), pleural fluid cell count (5 200 (120-50 000)x10(6)/L vs. 790 (68-6 920)x10(6)/L, Z=-3.125, P=0.002), pleural fluid lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (3 990 (589-29 382) U/L vs. 2 211 (673-3 993) U/L, Z=-2.488, P=0.013) in BNP group were significantly higher than those in MPNP group; while the values of pleural fluid glucose(0.43 (0.03-18.00) mmol/L vs. 5.95 (4.27-7.87) mmol/L, Z=-2.795, P=0.005), serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (2.3 (1.0-2.8) ng/L vs. 2.6 (1.3-109.2) ng/L, Z=-2.113, P=0.035) and interferon (IFN)-gamma (4.8 (2.6-7.7) ng/L vs. 11.9 (2.9-154.6) ng/L, Z=-2.455, P=0.014) were lower in BNP group than those in MPNP group. Meanwhile, the mean time from the onset of symptoms to the discovery of necrotic lesions was longer in MPNP group than that in BNP group ((20.6+-6.4) days vs. (14.6+-6.2) days, t=3.029, P=0.004). After treatments, all patients were discharged without death, WBC and PCT recovered more quickly in MPNP group than those in BNP group (12 (0-24) days vs. 0 (0-23) days, Z=-4.484, P&lt;0.01; 10 (5-15) days vs. 0 (0-23) days, Z=-3.244, P=0.001). As to prognosis, 34 cases were followed up, and the results showed that patients recovered without surgical intervention, and chest lesions were resolved within 3.0 (1.0-8.0) months, and the time to necrosis disappearance was similar in the BNP group and MPNP greup (3.0 (1.0-8.0) months vs. 3.0 (1.0-8.0) months, Z=-0.128, P=0.001). In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, the cut-off values for the age, WBC, CRP, PCT, pleural fluid cell count and pleural fluid glucose were set at 2.4 years of age, 17.2x10(9)/L, 157 mg/L, 1.505 mg/L, 2 630x10(6)/L and 3.73 mmol/L, respectively. Conclusions: NP is found to be severe and prolonged, yet, reversible through proper therapy, such as rational antibiotics application. The age, WBC, CRP, PCT, pleural fluid cell count and pleural fluid glucose could be used as biomarkers to differentiate MPNP from BNP in children."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the features of the etiological structure of neonatal pneumonia complicated by BPD, and to determine the sensitivity of pathogens to antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 194 preterm infants with VAP, birth weight from 780 to 2820 g and gestational age from 27 to 37 weeks was conducted. A microbiological study of washings from the respiratory tract was conducted by standard qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Respiratory tract infections caused by E. coli (with hemolytic properties), Enterococcus spp. (with hemolytic properties), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, various types of mycoplasmas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida krusei were found 4- 13 times more frequent in preterm infants with BPD than in preterm infants without BPD and more mature infants with or without this complication. BPD developed 7- 11 times more frequent in preterm infants with prolonged VAP and change in pathogens than in preterm infants with VAP without change of agent. BPD developed 5- 7 times more frequent in preterm infants with the association of pathogens than in preterm infants with a monoinfection. Massive colonization of respiratory tract pathogens by 1- 3 days of life (lg4 colony forming units in 1 ml and above) was an unfavorable prognostic factor for the development of VAP, complicated by BPD. CONCLUSION: The reduction in the frequency of BPD is might be possible with timeous and adequate antibacterial therapy of VAP."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:31404620TITLE:Ceftaroline fosamil as a potential treatment option for Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia in adults.ABSTRACT:Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is an important aetiological cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Empiric therapy for CAP frequently consists of beta-lactam monotherapy or beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. However, such agents are often ineffective against S. aureus and do not reflect the emergence and increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community setting. Ceftaroline fosamil is a fifth-generation parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive pathogens - such as S. aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes - and typical Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The approval of ceftaroline fosamil in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe CAP was based on two phase 3 trials (FOCUS 1 and 2), which demonstrated that ceftaroline fosamil was non-inferior to ceftriaxone, a standard empiric treatment for CAP, while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. Although head-to-head trials of ceftaroline fosamil versus comparators against MRSA CAP are lacking, the effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in subpopulations of patients not covered by phase 3 trials (e.g. those with MRSA CAP or severe renal impairment) has been demonstrated in the Clinical Assessment Program and Teflaro Utilization Registry (CAPTURE) study. As ineffective empiric therapy is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality and increased costs, ceftaroline fosamil, with its extended spectrum of activity, is an attractive alternative to standard antibiotic CAP regimens."

DESIGN: Review of published English literature between 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include young age, malnutrition, immunosuppression, tobacco smoke or air pollution exposure. Better methods for specimen collection and molecular diagnostics have improved microbiological diagnosis, indicating that pneumonia results from several organisms interacting. Induced sputum increases microbiologic yield for Bordetella pertussis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has been associated with pneumonia in high TB prevalence areas. The proportion of cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b has declined with new conjugate vaccines; Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae non-type b are the commonest bacterial pathogens; viruses are the most common pathogens. Effective interventions comprise antibiotics, oxygen and non-invasive ventilation. New vaccines have reduced severity and incidence of disease, but disparities exist in uptake. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia has decreased but a considerable preventable burden remains. Widespread implementation of available, effective interventions and development of novel strategies are needed."

We assess the post-pandemic mortality of influenza by comparing it to other community-acquired pneumonia in our ICU. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive, and single-centre cohort study. The main aim was to determine the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for influenza based on the quartiles of the SAPSII score in the reference population of 954 patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia. Another aim was to analyze the risk factors for mortality in influenza patients. Results: 127 consecutive patients were hospitalized in our ICU with a positive influenza PCR, from January 2013 to December 2017. The mortality rate of these patients was 31% (CI 95%: 23-39%). In patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia, the SMR of patients with influenza was 1.24 (CI 95%: 0.89-1.70). At admission, thirty-nine patients (31%) had superinfections, in 17 caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Need for renal replacement therapy (RR 2.53 [1.29-4.93]) or ECMO (RR 2.35 [1.16-4.74]) were associated with mortality. Twenty-four patients underwent ECMO, 17 with VV-ECMO. Conclusions: Mortality in patients with influenza pneumonia was higher than the expected mortality in community-acquired pneumonia. Although generally considered benign, influenza is a deadly infection in ICU patients in Reunion Island."

Herein, we report a case of community-acquired pneumonia with multiple organ failure in a 51-year-old patient with initial presentation of flu-like symptoms. The influenza rapid test from the specimen of nasopharyngeal swab was positive for type B influenza virus and was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gram stain of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed gram positive cocci in group. Both sputum and blood culture yielded MRSA. We identified the CA-MRSA was staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV strain carried Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. The patient made a complete recovery following an 8-week treatment course of linezolid and was discharged with independent daily activity. According to our experience, linezolid may be a reasonable treatment choice for CA-MRSA pneumonia due to the virulence of exotoxins."

Ceftobiprole is approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), excluding ventilator-associated pneumonia, in several European and non-European countries. Areas covered: In this narrative review, we discuss the current place in therapy of ceftobiprole, both within and outside approved indications. An inductive MEDLINE/PubMed search of the available literature was conducted. Expert opinion: There are three main reasons which render ceftobiprole an attractive option for the empirical and targeted treatment of CAP and HAP: (i) its broad spectrum of activity; (ii) its activity against MRSA; (iii) its good safety profile. For these indications, ceftobiprole should be employed thoughtfully, in those scenarios in which its intrinsic advantages could be maximized. The use of ceftobiprole outside approved indications could be justified in specific scenarios, such as when other approved alternatives are ineffective, when the risk of toxicity due to other agents is unacceptable, and for salvage therapy. In the near future, ongoing phase 3 studies and further observational experiences could both enlarge the current panel of approved indications and enrich our knowledge on the use of ceftobiprole for off-label indications."

CASE REPORT A 65-year-old man on maintenance hemodialysis presented with chest pain and dyspnea. He subsequently developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-positive acute pleural empyema in an evacuated right-sided pneumothorax. Surgical thoracoscopic curettage was ultimately performed, but dyspnea recurred postoperatively. Computed tomography depicted widespread reticular shadowing of the left lung, and peripheral eosinophilia was detected. The proportion of eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also remarkable (43%). All symptoms and the results of laboratory tests immediately improved after the discontinuation of vancomycin and initiation of prednisolone therapy. CONCLUSIONS We attribute this case of eosinophilic pneumonia to vancomycin, because all other candidate causes were ruled out, and only vancomycin fulfilled the criteria of both drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia and drug-induced lung injury. If confirmed, this constitutes the first reported case of vancomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia."

However, life-threatening infections (eg, necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis) caused by PVL-SA have also been reported.We assessed the clinical phenotype, frequency, clinical implications (surgery, length of treatment in hospitals/intensive care units, and antibiotic treatments), and potential preventability of severe PVL-SA infections in children.Total, 75 children treated for PVL-SA infections in our in- and outpatient units from 2012 to 2017 were included in this retrospective study.Ten out of 75 children contracted severe infections (PVL-methicillin resistant S aureus n = 4) including necrotizing pneumonia (n = 4), necrotizing fasciitis (n = 2), pyomyositis (n = 2; including 1 patient who also had pneumonia), mastoiditis with cerebellitis (n = 1), preorbital cellulitis (n = 1), and recurrent deep furunculosis in an immunosuppressed patient (n = 1). Specific complications of PVL-SA infections were venous thrombosis (n = 2), sepsis (n = 5), respiratory failure (n = 5), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 3). The median duration of hospital stay was 14 days (range 5-52 days). In 6 out of 10 patients a history suggestive for PVL-SA colonization in the patient or close family members before hospital admission was identified.PVL-SA causes severe to life-threatening infections requiring lengthy treatments in hospital in a substantial percentage of symptomatic PVL-SA colonized children.

We surveyed clinical outcomes of MRSA pneumonia in daily practice to identify risk factors for the clinical failure and mortality in patients with MRSA pneumonia. This multicenter prospective observational study was performed across 48 Japanese medical institutions. Adult patients with culture-positive MRSA pneumonia were recruited and treated with anti-MRSA antibiotics. The relationships between clinical and microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes at test of cure (TOC) or 30-day all-cause mortality were analyzed. In total, 199 eligible patients, including nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (n = 95), hospital-acquired pneumonia (n = 76), and community-acquired pneumonia (n = 25), received initial treatment with anti-MRSA agents such as vancomycin (n = 135), linezolid (n = 36), or teicoplanin (n = 22). Overall clinical failure rate at TOC and the 30-day mortality rate were 51.1% (48/94 patients) and 33.7% (66/196 patients), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses for vancomycin-treated populations revealed that abnormal white blood cell count (odds ratio [OR] 4.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-14.39) was a risk factor for clinical failure and that no therapeutic drug monitoring (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.35-7.12) and abnormally high C-reactive protein level (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.26-9.92) were risk factors for mortality. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that majority of MRSA pneumonia patients are initially treated with vancomycin in Japan, and the absence of therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin is significantly associated with the mortality in patients with MRSA pneumonia."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:31619219TITLE:Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to be based on site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed or because of unrecognition of the pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managing in general wards. METHODS: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 h were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study. RESULTS: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood culture than patients with non-severe CAP (24% VS 4.5%; p = .008). Initial antibiotic treatment were discordant with the IDSA/ATS guidelines in 42% of all patients hospitalized with CAP, and 52% of patients with severe CAP. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01-1.1) and initial antibiotic treatment discordant to guidelines for severe CAP in ICU (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3-17.1) were independent risk factors of the unfavorable outcome of patients with severe CAP. Patients with unfavorable outcome had lower number of hospital-free days than patients with favorable outcome (5.2 +- 8 days VS 18 +- 7.1 days; p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes."

A secondary objective was to characterize the clonality and acquired resistance and virulence genes of MRSA. METHODS: Consecutive non-replicate isolates from HAP were collected from 13 laboratories distributed across Italy, from January to May 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution, and results were interpreted according to the EUCAST breakpoints. All MRSA isolates were subjected to WGS using an Illumina platform. Clonality and resistance and virulence gene content were investigated with bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Among 333 isolates from HAP, S. aureus was the third most common pathogen (18.6%). The proportion of MRSA was 40.3%. Susceptibility to ceftobiprole was 100% for MSSA and 95.5% for MRSA. Lower susceptibility rates of 78.4% and 94.6% in MSSA and 36.4% and 12.1% in MRSA isolates were observed for erythromycin and levofloxacin, respectively. The MRSA from HAP mostly belonged to clonal complex (CC) 22 (47.0%), CC5 (25.8%) and CC8 (15.2%), with a minority of other lineages (ST1, ST6, ST7, ST30, ST152 and ST398). Acquired resistance and virulence genes in most cases exhibited a clonal distribution. The three ceftobiprole-resistant isolates exhibited an MIC of 4 mg/L and belonged to ST228-MRSA-I of CC5. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus is an important cause of HAP in Italy. Ceftobiprole exhibited good in vitro activity against S. aureus isolated from HAP, including MRSA. A trend to replacement of ST228 with ST22 was noticed compared with previous studies."

The aim of our study was to evaluate the demography, incidence, risk factors, causative bacterial pathogens and outcome of all episodes of Hospital-acquired pneumonia in our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study, at a tertiary university hospital during one year (2014) including all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Sixty patients were identified with pneumonia. Thirty-five (58.3%) had an intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, corresponding to 6.9 cases/1000 intubation-days. Antibiotic treatment in the previous 30 days was present in 75% of the cases. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 26.2%, 20.0% and 9.2%, respectively. Patients with late-onset hospital-acquired pneumonia (>= 7 days) showed higher frequency of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolates, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Combination therapy was performed in 67.0%, and de-escalation in 18.3%. The mortality rate was 18.3%. The adjusted odds ratio for intensive care unit mortality in the group of patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia was 5.2 (95% CI of 1.02 - 22.10; p = 0.046). DISCUSSION: The knowledge of local bacterial flora and resistance patterns is of crucial importance and strongly recommended. This evidence increases the probability of success of empiric antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: S. aureus was the predominant causative agent of nosocomial pneumonia. The most frequent risk factor identified for infection with multidrug-resistant organisms was previous treatment with antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant organisms were present in 45% of documented hospital-acquired pneumonias. In admitted patients with non-intensive care unit acquired pneumonia, the intensive care unit mortality rate was nearly five times higher compared to intensive care unit acquired pneumonia."

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of SPE patients hospitalized between January 2007 and June 2018 in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients with SPE were identified. All patients had bilateral multiple peripheral nodules on chest computed tomography. The most common pathogen found in blood culture was Staphylococcus aureus (10/33, 30.3%). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 39 patients and 20 showed vegetations. Bronchoscopy was performed in 24 patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from 15 patients (62.5%) and showed predominantly polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (52%, range of 48%~ 63%). Four patients received transbronchial lung biopsy, and histopathological examinations revealed suppurative pneumonia and organizing pneumonia. The in-hospital mortality rate was 19.4%. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.100; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-1.169), hypotension (OR 7.260; 95% CI 1.126-46.804) and ineffective or delay of empirical antimicrobial therapy (OR 7.341; 95% CI 1.145-47.045) were found to be independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality, whereas drainage treatment was found to be a protective factor (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.002-0.677). CONCLUSIONS: SPE cases presented with nonspecific clinical manifestations and radiologic features. Blood cultures and bronchoscopy are important measures for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis. There is relationship between primary infection sites and the type of pathogen. Maintaining normal blood pressure and providing timely and appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy for effective control of the infection could improve prognosis."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the a) aetiology, b) factors associated with bacterial pneumonia and c) association between co-infections (bacteria + virus) and severity of disease, in children admitted with severe pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study involving children aged 1-month to 5-years admitted with very severe pneumonia, as per the WHO definition, over 2 years. Induced sputum and blood obtained within 24 hrs of admission were examined via PCR, immunofluorescence and culture to detect 17 bacteria/viruses. A designated radiologist read the chest radiographs. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with a mean (SD) age of 14 (+-15) months old were recruited. Significant pathogens were detected in 62% of patients (n = 186). Viruses alone were detected in 23.7% (n = 71) with rhinovirus (31%), human metapneumovirus (HMP) [22.5%] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16.9%] being the commonest. Bacteria alone was detected in 25% (n = 75) with Haemophilus influenzae (29.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (24%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.7%) being the commonest. Co-infections were seen in 13.3% (n = 40) of patients. Male gender (AdjOR 1.84 [95% CI 1.10, 3.05]) and presence of crepitations (AdjOR 2.27 [95% CI 1.12, 4.60]) were associated with bacterial infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) [p = 0.007]) was significantly higher in patients with co-infections but duration of hospitalization (p = 0.77) and requirement for supplemental respiratory support (p = 0.26) were not associated with co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria remain an important cause of very severe pneumonia in developing countries with one in four children admitted isolating bacteria alone. Male gender and presence of crepitations were significantly associated with bacterial aetiology. Co-infection was associated with a higher CRP but no other parameters of severe clinical illness."

Primary analysis was an inverse probability of treatment-weighted propensity score analysis using generalized estimating equation regression; secondary analyses included an instrumental variable analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted from June 14 to November 20, 2019. Exposures: Empirical anti-MRSA therapy plus standard pneumonia therapy vs standard therapy alone within the first day of hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of 30-day all-cause mortality after adjustment for patient comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory results. Secondary outcomes included the development of kidney injury and secondary infections with Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, or gram-negative bacilli. Results: Among 88 605 hospitalized patients (86 851 men; median age, 70 years [interquartile range, 62-81 years]), empirical anti-MRSA therapy was administered to 33 632 (38%); 8929 patients (10%) died within 30 days. Compared with standard therapy alone, in weighted propensity score analysis, empirical anti-MRSA therapy plus standard therapy was significantly associated with an increased adjusted risk of death (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]), kidney injury (aRR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.5]), and secondary C difficile infections (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp infections (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.3]), and secondary gram-negative rod infections (aRR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]). Similar associations between anti-MRSA therapy use and 30-day mortality were found by instrumental variable analysis (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.9]) and among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (aRR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]), those with a high risk for MRSA (aRR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]), and those with MRSA detected on surveillance testing (aRR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-1.9]). No significant favorable association was found between empirical anti-MRSA therapy and death among patients with MRSA detected on culture (aRR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.8-1.4]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that empirical anti-MRSA therapy was not associated with reduced mortality for any group of patients hospitalized for pneumonia. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that questions the value of empirical use of anti-MRSA therapy using existing risk approaches."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:32134016TITLE:Aetiological agents for pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis: An observational study from a tertiary care centre in northern India.ABSTRACT:Background & objectives: Pulmonary disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations."

During a two-month study period, 154 (mean age: 75.2 ++ 12.2 years; 94 males) out of 620 (24.8%) hospitalized patients underwent 174 blood cultures and were enrolled in the study. The rate of true-positive cultures was 11.5% (20/174) and the rate of false-positive (contaminants) was 5.7% (10/174). A total of 23 microorganisms (5 multidrug resistant strains), most frequently Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), were isolated. The positivity rate was significantly higher in patients with urinary tract infection (31%) and abdomen infection (26.1%) than in patients with pneumonia (4.9%; p<0.01). Although the positivity rate in patients exposed to antibiotics was lower than in those not exposed, the difference was not statistically significant. Therapy changes due to blood culture positivity were observed in 7.1% of the patients overall. In-hospital death was observed in nine of the 136 patients with negative blood cultures (6.6%) and in none of the 18 patients with positive blood cultures. These results indicate that the yield and clinical impact of blood cultures is quite low in patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward and suggest the need to improve the adequacy of the indications to perform the test."

We aimed to analyze medical records of children undergoing surgical treatment for PNZ and compare our results with those found in the medical literature. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of children's medical charts who underwent an operation for PNZ, between July 2006 and July 2016, in two hospitals in southern Santa Catarina, Brazil. RESULTS: A total of 26 children with a median age of 2.70 years and mostly females (61.5%) were included in the current study. The main symptoms were fever (88.5%) and cough (65.4%). There was an average use of 4.31 antibiotics per patient. The primary etiological agent was Staphylococcus aureus (23.1%), but cultures were negative in 69% of the patients. Decortication and debridement of necrotic areas were performed in 23 patients (88.5%). The mean postoperative pleural drainage was 8.12 days. The presence of bronchopleural fistula occurred in 50.0% in the preoperative period and 46.2% in the postoperative. The total length of hospital stay was, on average, 27.52 days and the postoperative length of stay was 12.60 days (mean). Postoperative complications occurred in 13 children and there was no mortality. CONCLUSION: The surgical approach is indicated to patients with no response to clinical treatment. Late surgical intervention is associated with progressive parenchyma infection and higher rates of complications. Surgery can lead to better clinical outcomes and earlier recovery."

Aim of this study was analysis of patients residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and developing pneumonia to reach a better knowledge of criteria for hospitalization and outcomes. MATERIALS/METHODS: this is a prospective, observational study in which patients residing in 3 LTCFs (metropolitan area of Rome, Italy) and developing pneumonia, hospitalized or treated in LTCF, were recruited and followed up from January 2017 to June 2019. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, secondary endpoint was analysis of risk factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: Overall, 146 episodes of NHAP were enrolled in the study: 57 patients were treated in LTCF, while 89 patients were hospitalized. Overall incidence rates of NHAP varied from 2.6 to 7.5 per 1000 residents. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (25%), and in 28 (55%) patients was documented a MDR pathogen. For hospitalized patients was reported a higher 30-day mortality (43.8% Vs 7%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that severe pneumonia, neoplasm, chronic hepatitis, antibiotic monotherapy, and malnutrition were independent risk factors for hospitalization from LTCF. MDR pathogen, severe pneumonia, COPD, and moderate to severe renal disease were independently associated with death at 30 days. CONCLUSION: frail elderly patients in LTCF have a high risk of MDR etiology with a higher risk to receive an inadequate antibiotic therapy and a fatal outcome. These results point to the need for increased provision of acute care and strategies in LTCF."

SUMMARY: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a frequently utilized support therapy for patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure. Dosing of medications during ECMO can be challenging due to several factors, including sequestration of medications within ECMO circuits, alterations in volume of distribution, and changes in drug clearance. The patient was initiated on empiric antibiotics, then switched to linezolid at a dose of 600 mg every 8 hours. Linezolid plasma concentrations were collected 30 minutes prior to the sixth administered dose and 30 minutes following the 1-hour infusion of the sixth dose, which resulted in values of 0.4 and 1.7 mug/mL, respectively. The ratio of 24-hour area under the curve (AUC0-24) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), assuming a MIC of 2 mug/mL, was calculated using the extrapolated maximum concentration (1.9 mug/mL) and minimum concentration (0.35 mug/mL), resulting in an AUC0-24/MIC value of 10.8. Due to subtherapeutic linezolid plasma concentrations, ceftaroline was initiated and continued for a total of 18 days. To our knowledge, this is the second report to describe inadequate plasma concentrations of linezolid during ECMO. CONCLUSION: In the case described here, linezolid at a dose of 600 mg every 8 hours did not achieve target plasma concentrations in a patient receiving concomitant venovenous ECMO support."

The three main pathogens involved in pleural empyema in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus. METHODS: A questionnaire according to the DELPHI method was sent to experts in the field (paediatric pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists) in France with the purpose of reaching a consensus on the conservative antibiotic treatment of pleural empyema in children. Two rounds were completed as part of this DELPHI process. RESULTS: Our work has shown that in the absence of clinical signs of severity, the prescription of an intravenous monotherapy is consensual but there is no agreement on the choice of drug to use. A consensus was also reached on treatment adjustment based on the results of blood cultures, the non-systematic use of a combination therapy, the need for continued oral therapy and the lack of impact of pleural drainage on infection control. On the other hand, after the second round of DELPHI, there was no consensus on the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and on the treatment of severe pleural empyema, especially when caused by Staphylococci. CONCLUSIONS: The result of this work highlights the needed for new French recommendations based on the evolution of microbial epidemiology in the post PCV13 era."

However, the effects of a professional oral care intervention on these factors remain unclear. The aims of this quasi-experimental study were to compare bacterial concentrations in saliva and sputum, oral health status, distribution of Staphylococcus aureus, and pneumonia status before and after a professional oral care intervention. METHODS: A purposive sample of residents from two nursing homes was divided into an intervention group that received a weekly professional oral care intervention and a control group. Oral bacterial concentration was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Staphylococcus aureus distribution was determined by bacterial culture and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. After data collection, a statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the intervention. RESULTS: Most residents were unconscious (80%), and most had a history of pneumonia (76%). Baseline demographic data did not significantly differ between the two groups. After the intervention, the intervention group had significant improvements in plaque index (1.66 +- 0.78 vs. 0.94 +- 0.64, p <  0.01), gingival index (2.36 +- 0.76 vs. 1.65 +- 0.83, p <  0.01), tongue coating index (0.96 +- 1.10 vs. 0.16 +- 0.47, p <  0.01), distribution of Staphylococcus aureus in salivary samples (11.11 +- 14.47% vs. 1.74 +- 3.75%, p = 0.02), and salivary bacterial concentration ([4.27 +- 3.65] x 105 vs. [0.75 +- 1.20] x 105, p <  0.01). Sputum bacterial concentration did not significantly differ. The intervention group also had a significantly lower annual prevalence of pneumonia hospitalization (1.24 +- 1.51 vs. 0.48 +- 0.59, p = 0.01), especially in residents whose salivary bacterial concentration exceeded the median. However, the duration of pneumonia hospitalization did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A professional oral care intervention in nursing home residents can improve oral health, reduce levels of salivary bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, and decrease the annual prevalence of pneumonia hospitalization.

The data on NP are scant from developing world and we aimed to describe the characteristic features of NP in our children. STUDY DESIGN: Single center retrospective cohort analysis. PATIENT SELECTION: Institutional database of children treated for pneumonia between September 2014 and May 2018 was searched to identify children with NP. METHODS: The demographic characteristics, laboratory results, and clinical information were recorded for patients selected as NP and analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 10 patients (3.7%) of NP were identified out of 272 patients with pneumonia. Median age was 3 years (range: 3 months to 12years). All cases had severe respiratory distress and 70% required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. The causative pathogens were identified in 6/10 children (60%) with Staphylococcus aureus being most common (4/10). Pleural effusion and pneumothorax were seen in six cases. Four cases had bilateral pleural effusion and three had bilateral pneumothorax. Intercostal drainage (ICD) was placed in 70% and bilateral ICD was placed in 40% cases. Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) developed in two cases and one had bilateral BPF. Median [inter quartile range] ICD days and hospital stay were 9 (6-14) and 13.5 (7.5-18.5) days, respectively. Mean (+-SD) total antibiotic (in hospital plus outpatient) days were 28.8 +- 9.6 days. Four cases had airway hemorrhage and in three cases this was massive and fatal. CONCLUSION: NP is a relatively rare but severe complication of pneumonia distinct from pediatric acute respiratory distress, pleural effusion and empyema. Airway hemorrhage is the most fatal complication."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

Here, we describe a case of acute onset during chemoradiotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma, requiring a total proctocolectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for chemoradiotherapy of lung cancer. He had no obvious history of gastrointestinal diseases, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy was initiated. Thirteen days after 2 cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine, he experienced persistent hematochezia. Findings of the colonoscopy revealed edematous thickening from the rectum to the transverse colon, suggesting UC, drug-induced colitis, or infectious colitis. Results from bacterial culture were negative for Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Immunohistological staining for cytomegalovirus was also negative. Although he was clinically diagnosed with UC and treated with intravenous glucocorticoid, his symptoms gradually worsened and an abdominal X-ray revealed megacolon. Thirty-five days after conservative therapy, a total proctocolectomy with end permanent ileostomy was performed. Based on pathological findings and clinical course, he was diagnosed with UC. CONCLUSION: Although the pathogenesis of UC during chemotherapy has been unknown, chemotherapy could be one of the causes of UC in this case. UC should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with progressive colitis during chemotherapy."

A rare complication is an infection of the subgaleal hematoma, which typically happens due to concomitant scalp lacerations. Escherichia coli is the most common causative pathogen in peripartum cases, and Staphylococcus aureus predominates in trauma cases. An even more rare complication is infection of the hematoma with intact overlying skin, the proposed mechanism of action of which is a hematogenous spread of the bacteria. In this case, we report a 4-month-old unimmunized girl who sustained a subgaleal hematoma after a falling incident that did not result in any scalp laceration. She presented 5 days later with fever, irritability, increased scalp swelling, skin erythema, and site tenderness. Her blood culture remained sterile, but the hematoma aspirate culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient had a recent upper respiratory tract infection that we suspected to be the primary source of infection. She responded well to antibiotic therapy and required no surgical intervention. Conclusion: Subgaleal hematoma infection should be suspected in a child who presents with increased hematoma swelling, irritability, fever, and local signs of infection. Early recognition and treatment with antibiotics can prevent further complications, such as abscess formation and skull osteomyelitis."

Objective: To develop a methodology for evaluating local epidemiology and validating local risk factors for P aeruginosa and MRSA. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective cohort evaluated adult patients admitted for pneumonia. Risk factors for MRSA and P aeruginosa were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression and reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Results: There were 10 723 cases evaluated. Lung abscess/empyema had the highest odds associated with MRSA (aOR = 4.24; P < 0.0001), followed by influenza (aOR = 2.34; P = 0.01), end-stage renal disease (ESRD; aOR = 2.09; P = 0.006), illicit substance use (aOR = 1.7; P = 0.007), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; aOR = 1.26; P = 0.04). For P aeruginosa, the highest odds were in bronchiectasis (aOR = 6.13; P < 0.0001), lung abscess/empyema (aOR = 3.36; P = 0.005), and COPD (aOR = 1.84; P < 0.0001). Isolated COPD without other risk factors did not pose an increased risk of either organism. Conclusion and Relevance: Influenza, ESRD, lung abscess/empyema, and illicit substance use were local risk factors for MRSA. Bronchiectasis and lung abscess/empyema were risk factors for Pseudomonas.

However, little is known about the respiratory microorganisms in patients with endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB), which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the tracheobronchial tree due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. We retrospectively reviewed data for histopathologically and microbiologically confirmed EBTB patients diagnosed at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea between January 2013 and January 2019. Bacterial cultures were performed on bronchial washing from these patients at the time of EBTB diagnosis. A total of 216 patients with EBTB were included in the study.

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) producing MRSA has been reported to be associated with necrotizing pneumonia and worse outcome. The incidence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) pneumonia is very low, as only a few CA-MRSA pneumonia cases were reported in the last few years. We present a case of severe CAP caused by PVL-positive MRSA with ensuing septic shock. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 68-year-old male with no concerning medical history had developed a fever that reached 39.0 C, a productive cough that was sustained for 5 days, and hypodynamia. He was treated with azithromycin and alexipyretic in a nearby clinic for 2 days in which the symptoms were alleviated. However, 1 day later, the symptoms worsened, and he was taken to a local Chinese medicine hospital for traditional medicine treatment. However, his clinical condition deteriorated rapidly, and he then developed dyspnea and hemoptysis. DIAGNOSIS: CA-MRSA pneumonia and septic shock. The sputum culture showed MRSA. Polymerase chain reaction of MRSA isolates was positive for PVL genes. INTERVENTIONS: Mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic therapy were performed. Antibiotic therapy included mezlocillin sodium/sulbactam sodium, linezolid, and oseltamivir. OUTCOMES: He died after 12 hours of treatment. LESSONS: This is a report of severe pneumonia due to PVL-positive CA-MRSA in a healthy adult.

SCAP is distinguished by high mortality and socio - economic burden. Both etiology and antimicrobial resistance are essential for appropriate antibiotic choice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study recruited adults with confirmed diagnosis of SCAP admitted to multi - word hospitals of six Russian cities in 2014-2018. Etiology was confirmed by routine culture of blood, respiratory (sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage) and when appropriate, autopsy samples, urinary antigen tests (L. pneumophila serogroup 1, S. pneumoniae); real - time PCR for identification of ""atypical"" bacterial pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila) and respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, etc.) was applied. RESULTS: Altogether 109 patients (60.6% male; mean age 50.8+-18.0 years old) with SCAP were enrolled. Etiological agent was identified in 65.1% of patients, S. pneumoniae, rhinovirus, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were the most commonly isolated pathogens (found in 43.7, 15.5, 14.1 and 11.3% of patients with positive results of microbiological investigations, respectively). Bacteriemia was seen in 14.6% of patients and most commonly associated with S. pneumoniae. Co - infection with 2 or more causative agents was revealed in 36.6% of cases. Combination of bacterial pathogens (mainly S. pneumoniae with S. aureus or/and Enterobacterales) prevailed - 57.7% of cases; associations of bacteria and viruses were identified in 38.5% of patients, different viruses - in one case. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in adults with SCAP. A high rate of respiratory viruses (mainly rhinovirus and influenza viruses) identification both as mixt infection with bacteria and mono - infection should be taken into account."

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:32617242TITLE:Staphylococcus lugdunensis: Review of Epidemiology, Complications, and Treatment.ABSTRACT:Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) that induces a variety of infectious diseases, including skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), infective endocarditis (IE), and bone and PJI. This review article underscores the important points in the literature about S. lugdunensis infections, including its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as specific types of infections it can cause. Anatomical and age-related distributions of S. lugdunensis SSTIs have been noted, though they most commonly occur as abscesses. S. lugdunensis can also manifest as an aggressive form of IE presenting with valve destruction and abscess formation, frequently requiring surgery and with a high mortality rate. Bone and joint infections caused by S. lugdunensis are also more invasive than infections by other species of CNS. The clinical presentation of S. lugdunensis infection in SSTI, IE, and bone/joint infection is frequently more similar to that of S. aureus infection than that of other CNS infections, necessitating species-level differentiation of CNS for proper diagnosis. Though historically, this depended upon biochemical tests that were neither routine nor reliable, the implementation of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical laboratories has made identification of CNS species such as S. lugdunensis more practical. Imaging modalities, especially the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET), are another important emerging trend in the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as S. lugdunensis infection. S. lugdunensis remains highly susceptible to a wide gamut of antibacterial therapies, which is uncharacteristic of other CNS. Infections can usually be treated by antibiotics traditionally used for CNS such as oxacillin. The breakpoints for S. lugdunensis are higher than those of other CNS and similar to S. aureus breakpoints. In the case of aggressive IE or bone/joint infection by S. lugdunensis, it is recommended to treat with a beta-lactam agent. Further study is needed to understand the diversity, virulence, and population structure of this species, as well as its role in other infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory infections, peritonitis, and bacteremia."

Staphylococcus aureus is the main causative organism and diagnosis is usually established clinically, supported by imaging, but confirmation may be achieved by histopathological examination. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement are the cornerstone of treatment. Its prognosis is good but, as in all soft-tissue infections, it depends on early intervention, directed antibiotics and, if indicated, prompt surgery.

About 7796 references were screened for inclusion, and 52 references from 1908 to 2017 were included. One hundred seven cases of acute pyelonephritis in pregnant women were reviewed. Gestational age at diagnosis was reported as 2 (2%), 43 (40%), and 51 (52%) during the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Maternal complications included sepsis (49%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (47%), anaemia (33%), acute kidney injury (10%), renal abscess (6%), and death (6%). 25 preterm deliveries (23%), 6 intrauterine foetal demises (6%), 4 spontaneous abortions (4%), and 8 neonatal intensive care unit admissions (7%) were reported. Microorganisms cultured included Escherichia coli (51%), Klebsiella (8%), Proteus (5%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus (4%), and Enterococcus (3%). Early diagnosis and management led to fewer complications.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and in this article, we highlight the most common outcomes previously reported. Previous studies have reported maternal adverse outcomes and only very few stressed on fetal/neonatal outcomes.What do the results of this study add? The results add that not only is maternal morbidity/mortality is increased, but also increases adverse outcomes for the fetus/neonate, such as preterm delivery and fetal/neonatal demise.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The implications from this article serve to increase a medical providers knowledge on how to appropriately counsel pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis. In addition, future research can aim to understand why pregnant women are more prone to morbidity and mortality compared to nonpregnant women."

METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and the Cochrane Library databases. The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and the effects model was chosen according to the heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were performed according to different types of surgeries and measures of decolonization that Staphylococcus aureus carriers were applied. RESULTS: Twenty RCTs published between 1996 and 2019 involving 10,526 patients were included. Pooled results showed that the overall SSIs and pulmonary surgery SSIs presented with a statistical difference in measures of nasal decontamination (RR = 0.59 and 0.47, respectively, both p < 0.01). However, the associations between nasal decolonization and increased risks of SSIs in orthopedics surgery or cardiovascular surgery remained insignificant in studies. As for the diverse measures of nasal decontamination, 50% used mupirocin, 15% used chlorhexidine, 30% used different types of antimicrobial drugs, and 5% use others. The SSIs rate were decreased after chlorhexidine (RR = 0.474, 95% CI 0.259-0.864), while no significant difference was shown in the use of mupirocin (RR = 0.871, 95% CI 0.544-1.394). CONCLUSION: It seems that nasal decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus may be associated with a reduction of SSIs in these patients, especially in patients who have been administered by pulmonary surgeries or treated with chlorhexidine."

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. METHODS: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs   480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress   SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs   480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs   480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media.

The increasing incidence is of particular concern in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Since 2012, the Western France has witnessed high annual prevalence of S. maltophilia colonization/infection. This retrospective cohort study investigated the epidemiology of S. maltophilia emergence in the CF center of Roscoff, Western France, a region of high prevalence of CF in Europe. METHODS: All CF patients with S. maltophilia isolated in respiratory samples between December 2013 and February 2017 were included. For each patient the colonization status with S. maltophilia was determined. The epidemiological and microbiological characteristics collected were compared between colonization statuses. RESULTS: S. maltophilia was isolated in 90 patients (42 males, 48 females). Mean age at first colonization was 24.4+-13.5 years. Annual prevalence since 2013 was high (16-17.9%), but stable. This high prevalence is mainly due to a high rate of intermittent colonization. Only 2.8% of CF patients showed chronic colonization, with significantly more frequent co-colonization by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (P<0.0001) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P<0.05). During chronic colonization, S. maltophilia acquired resistance to cotrimoxazole and beta-lactams. Interestingly, there were cases of decolonization. CONCLUSION: This is the first epidemiological report of S. maltophilia in a French CF center. Prevalence was stable but above the national average. Most cases were intermittent; chronic colonization was rare."

Species from the anaerobic Porphyromonas genus are known to cause oral infections, but rarely cause infection of the skin. In this case report, we describe a subcutaneous abscess caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis in a 67-year-old man who had started chemotherapy for lung cancer (cT3N3M0 stage III B) three days prior to consulting a dermatologist. On clinical examination, a fist-sized mass with a hot sensation was observed in the left temporal region of the face, and treatment with cefazolin was commenced at 6 g/day. After three days, the mass was drained via skin incision and pus culture was performed, which revealed infection with P. gingivalis. The patient was successfully treated with abscess drainage and antibiotics therapy. We suggest that in tandem with immunosuppression, P. gingivalis could be a cause of skin infections."

These are found in the environment and tropical soil, usually presenting as colonizers and rarely cause human infection. Syncephalastrum racemosum is a species of the genus Syncephalastrum and is the most commonly identified pathogen. Most cases are reported in immunocompromised individuals, such as patients on long term steroids, poorly controlled diabetes, or patients with malignancy. Case presentation: We are describing two cases of rare fungal infection by Syncephalastrum species causing invasive pulmonary manifestation. Both patients had compromised immune status and presented with worsening dyspnea to the emergency room. Both had signs and symptoms of bilateral worsening pneumonia evident by chest X-ray showing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Syncephalastrum species were isolated from sputum cultures. Deoxycholate amphotericin B was started and the response was monitored. One patient expired while the other improved. Syncephalastrum species belong to class Mucormycosis, rarely causing invasive infection but when they do outcome is potentially fatal. Very few cases are reported worldwide so the clinical course is still unclear. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first two cases to be reported from Pakistan. Conclusions: These two cases describe pneumonia as a result of concomitant infection by rare fungal speciesSyncephalastrum and MRSA in immunocompromised patients. Few cases are reported so limited data is available to understand complete disease implications. Mucormycosis is a therapeutic challenge because of the phylogenetic diversity, un-availability of any serological testing and invasive disease pattern."

To highlight this principle, we examined acute kidney injury (AKI) in IgA-dominant infection-associated glomerulonephritis (GN) and menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS). Both GN and mTSS are rare diseases caused by staphylococcal infection, and renal function is frequently impaired. The resulting AKIs are disparate pathological entities driven by distinct immune mechanisms. We begin by describing the case of a diabetic man with pyopneumothorax following methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He had endocapillary proliferative GN with in situ IgA-dominant immune-complex formation in the mesangium accompanied by complement C3 deposition in the glomerular capillary wall. By contrast, acute tubular necrosis was observed in a case of mTSS; the patient's immune response was stimulated differently by MRSA enterotoxin and exotoxin resulting in aberrant IgA deposition, complement activation, and insufficient antibody production. As a multidisciplinary communication covering the fields of nephrology, immunology, and pathology, this report may help clinicians to understand these distinct renal lesions and make optimal therapeutic decisions expeditiously."

Community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia are characterized by high healthcare costs, morbidity and non-negligible rates of fatality. The overcoming prevalence of resistant gram-negative and positive bacteria (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin and ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases producing Enterobacteriaceae) has made the most of the first-line agents ineffective for treating lower respiratory tract infections. A broad-spectrum of activity, favourable pulmonary penetration, harmlessness and avoiding in some cases a combination therapy, characterise new cephalosporins such as ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftobiprole, ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftaroline. We aimed to summarise the role and place in therapy of new cephalosporins in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia within the setting of internal medicine wards. The ""universal pneumonia antibiotic strategy"" is no longer acceptable for treating lung infections.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if the presence of clusters of Gram-positive cocci in Gram staining of respiratory samples predicts S. aureus as HAP/VAP pathogen. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Scielo, CINAHL and Scopus, from inception to 15/07/2017 (update on 31/10/2019) and original data from a single-centre database (PROSPERO: CRD42017072138). STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of a Gram staining evaluation suggestive of Staphylococcus compared with a positive culture for S. aureus in any type of lower respiratory tract sample. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with HAP/VAP. INDEX TEST: Morphological evaluation of Gram staining of respiratory samples. METHODS: We followed PRISMA guidelines and assessed risk of bias and applicability with the QUADAS-2 tool. We conducted a meta-analysis using a bivariate random effects model. RESULTS: We selected five studies that included only VAP and data from a single-centre database including VAP and HAP. We pooled six studies for VAP and analysed 1,665 respiratory samples. Pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI, 49-83%) and specificity, 95% (95% CI, 86-98). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 12.7 (95% CI, 5.1-31.6); negative likelihood ratio, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.20-0.57); diagnostic odds ratio, 38 (95% CI, 13-106) and area under the SROC, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.93). There was great heterogeneity between sensitivity and specificity. In scenarios, in which prevalence of S. aureus was between 5 and 20%, the positive and negative predictive values were 62% (95% CI, 47-77%) and 95% (95% CI, 82-100%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cocci in clusters in respiratory samples of patients with VAP has potential to guide risk assessments of S. aureus for more personalised antibiotic coverage.

Conclusions: The infection of MRSA is mainly found in infants under 3 years old. The prevalent seasons are winter and spring, and MRSA is mainly acquired in the community. The main clinical diseases are pneumonia, skin soft-tissue infection and sepsis. No MRSA isolate is resistant to vancomycin, linezolid. MRSA isolates are generally sensitive to sulfonamides, levofloxacin, gentamicin, rifampicin, minocycline, and were highly resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. To achieve better prognosis. clinicians should initiate anti-infective treatment for children with MRSA infection according to the clinical characteristics of patients and drug sensitivity of the isolates timely and effectively."

PVL is an esotoxin causing leucocyte destruction and tissue necrosis. We report on a case of osteomyelitis involving the hip joint with thromblophlebitis complicated by necrotizing pneumonia and life-threatening septic shock. The child required advance respiratory support for 14 days with circulatory support for 7 days in ICU (intensive care unit), surgical draninage via arthrotomy of hip joint and second-line antibiotic treatment for 1 month. Among a wide literature, in Europe over half of Panton-Valentine St. Aureus (PVL-SA) is MSSA. Investigations for PVL are not always available determining an under-recognition of the episodes. Data on prevalence of PVL-SA in Italy are scarce. With this clinical report, we emphasize the recognition of clinical features that must lead to suspect PVL-SA osteomyelitis in children, providing their adequate management."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:32867740TITLE:Pathogenic characteristics of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infection in a large teaching hospital in China: a retrospective study.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRIs) is very common both in terms of community-acquired infection and hospital-acquired infection. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are the most important specimens obtained from patients with LRI. The choice of antibiotic with which to treat LRI usually depends on the antimicrobial sensitivity of bacteria isolated from sputum and BALF. However, differences in the antimicrobial sensitivity of pathogens isolated from sputum and BALF have not been evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the differences between sputum and BALF samples in terms of pathogen isolation and antimicrobial sensitivity in hospitalized patients with LRI. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, quality evaluation of sputum samples was not conducted before performing sputum culture; however, between 2016 and 2018, quality evaluation of sputum samples was conducted first, and only quality-assured samples were cultured. The numbers of sputum and BALF in 2013-2015 were 15,549 and 1671, while those in 2016-2018 were 12,055 and 3735, respectively. The results of pathogen culture showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were in the top ten pathogens isolated from sputum and BALF. An antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that the susceptibility of BALF isolates to most antibiotics was higher compared with the susceptibility of sputum isolates, especially after quality control of sputum samples (2016-2018). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that caution is needed in making therapeutic choices for patients with LRI when using antimicrobial sensitivity results from sputum isolates as opposed to BALF isolates."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 81 MRSA strains from four health centers of the Aragua-Venezuela State were studied. Methicillin resistance was performed with the Kirby-Bauer method with oxacillin (1 microg) and cefoxitin (30 microg) disks. The mecA gene and SCCmec were analyzed by the multiple PCR technique. RESULTS: Only 55 isolates (67.9%) amplified the mecA gene, and 24 strains (43.6%) amplified SCCmec. SCCmec type I was the most frequency, followed by SCCmec IV and SCCmec III, representing 62.5%, 25% and 12.5%, respectively. SCCmec I was predominant in health center A (80%), while in B and C 60% and 100% respectively were SCCmec IV. At health center D, 50% turned out to be SCCmec I and 50% SCCmec IVd. A relationship was found between the SCCmec and the health center with statistical significance. SCCmec I predominated in skin and soft tissue and respiratory infections with 63.2% and 50%, respectively. There was no association between genotype and type of infection with a p value greater than 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SCCmec I and IV will allow establishing new measures in the use of antibiotics and epidemiological control."

We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure. RESULTS: From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the predictors of co-infection together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia."

We isolated community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains producing both TSST-1 and PVL isolated from severe necrotizing pneumonia cases in a Nepali family. Detection of these CA-MRSA strains is rare in the world, and infection with these strains can take a rapidly progressive and lethal course. In this study, we traced the clinical course of this case and conducted a genetic analysis of the isolated strains. Case Report: We described 2 familial cases (a 20-year-old male and 61-year-old female) of severe necrotizing pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA with the TSST-1 and PVL genes. A 20-year-old Nepalese male was admitted to our hospital after a 3-day history of high fever and coughing. Despite resuscitation efforts, he died of multiple organ failure. A 61-year-old Nepalese female was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of high fever and dyspnea for 1 day. She was the grandmother of the male subject and mostly stayed at his residence in Japan. We administered intravenous antibiotics, including anti-MRSA antibiotics, and she improved in 2 weeks. The sequence type of the isolates was ST22/SCCmec type IVa, and the spa type was t005. The virulence genes detected were as follows: PVL gene (lukSF-pv), TSST-1 gene (tst-1), sec, seg, sei, sel, sem, sen, seo, and seu. ST22 was not the dominant CA-MRSA clone type in Japan. Some of the reports demonstrated that PVL-/TSST-1-positive ST22-MRSA strains are prevalent in Nepal. Therefore, the MRSA strains were thought to be acquired from Nepal. Conclusion: These cases highlight the emergence of TSST-1- and PVL-positive CA-MRSA infection and its association with life-threatening community-acquired necrotizing pneumonia. Clinicians should note the possibility of introducing MRSA strains from abroad and be aware of this illness to initiate appropriate treatment."

The PES score was developed in 2015 to predict the microbiological etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (PES microorganisms). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate the usefulness of the PES score for predicting PES microorganisms in two cohorts of patients with CAP from Valencia and Mataro. METHODS: We analyzed two prospective observational cohorts of patients with CAP from Valencia and Mataro. Patients in the Mataro cohort were all admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Of the 1,024 patients in the Valencia cohort, 505(51%) had a microbiological etiology and 31(6%) had a PES microorganism isolated. The AUC was 0.81. For a PES score >=5, sensitivity, specificity, the negative and positive predictive values as well as the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 72%, 74%, 98%, 14%, 0.38, and 2.75, respectively. Of the 299 patients in the Mataro cohort, 213(71%) had a microbiological etiology and 11(5%) had a PES microorganism isolated. The AUC was 0.73. For a PES score >=5, sensitivity, specificity, the negative and positive predictive values, as well as the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 36%, 83%, 96%, 11%, 0.77, and 2.09, respectively. The best cut-off for patients admitted to ICU was 4 points, which improved sensitivity to 86%. The hypothetical application of the PES score showed high rates of overtreatment in both cohorts (26% and 35%, respectively) and similar rates of under-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The PES score showed good accuracy in predicting the risk for microorganisms that required different empirical therapy; however, its use as a single strategy for detecting non-core pathogens could lead to high rates of overtreatment. Given its high negative predictive value, PES score may be used as a first step of a wider strategy that includes subsequent advanced diagnostic tests."

Complicated community-acquired pneumonia should be suspected in any child with pneumonia not responding to appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48-72 h. Common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients have initial imaging with chest radiography and ultrasound, which can also be used to assess the lung parenchyma, to identify pleural fluid; CT scanning is not usually indicated. Complicated pneumonia is treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, and then oral antibiotics. The initial choice of antibiotic is guided by local microbiological knowledge and by subsequent positive cultures and molecular testing, including on pleural fluid if a drainage procedure is done. Information from pleural space imaging and drainage should guide the decision on whether to administer intrapleural fibrinolytics. Most patients are treated by drainage and more extensive surgery is rarely needed; in any event, in low-income and middle-income countries, resources for extensive surgeries are scarce. The clinical course of complicated community-acquired pneumonia can be prolonged, especially when patients have necrotising pneumonia, but complete recovery is the usual outcome."

On several previous orthopedic surgery clinic visits, pathological back pain had not been considered and pain killers had been prescribed because he had low back pain due to lumbar spinal canal stenosis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for infectious spondylodiscitis and infective endocarditis with disseminated abscess caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Shock refractory tachyarrhythmia could not be managed with antiarrhythmic agent in the intensive care unit. Intractable low back pain and persistent tachyarrhythmia were adequately managed by pain control with fentanyl in the intensive care unit. Infectious spondylodiscitis and infective endocarditis were effectively managed with anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus drugs, initially in rotational usage, but the patient died of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli pneumonia on day 50 of hospitalization. Infectious spondylodiscitis should have been considered for persistent low back pain with hemodialysis, fever, and a history of device implantation. Pain management may be necessary for persistent tachycardia that proves unresponsive to usual antiarrhythmic medications."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%.

Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

Methods: Retrospective analysis was used to select sputum samples from 400 lung cancer patients after chemotherapy admitted in Fuyang People's Hospital from July 2017 to July 2019. Culture, isolation and identification of strains were conducted in accordance with the national clinical examination operating procedures. Results: A total of 134 strains were identified. In 120 patients with pulmonary infection, 114 strains were cultured. Twenty strains of klebsiella pneumoniae were cultured in 280 patients without pulmonary infection. Among the 134 strains, the detection rate of gram-negative bacteria was 79.10%. The first four strains were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. The gram-positive bacteria detection rate was 4.47%, mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus. The fungus detection rate was 16.42%. The drug sensitivity results showed that the resistance rate of gram-negative bacillus to penicillin and cephalosporin was higher, and were more sensitive to carbapenem, piperacillin tazobactam and cefoperazone sulbactam. Gram-positive cocci were resistant to penicillin, macrolide and clindamycin, and sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin and rifampicin. All strains of fungal culture were candida albicans, which were sensitive to common antifungal drugs. Among the 20 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae cultured in sputum specimens of non-infected patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy, 2 strains were integron-positive strains, and all of them were class I integrons. Conclusions: Lung cancer patients after chemotherapy have a high resistance to commonly used antimicrobial drugs, so it is necessary to detect the resistance of pathogenic microorganisms in clinical practice. The strains carried by patients with lung cancer without pulmonary infection during chemotherapy can isolate type I integrons, suggesting that the spread of drug resistance at gene level should be closely detected."

In the early 2000's the proportion of infections due the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) increased rapidly. We described the clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive S. aureus disease in a pediatric population. METHODS: We prospectively identified children in Utah with invasive S. aureus infections. Medical records were reviewed to determine diagnosis and clinical characteristics. Isolates were genotyped using multi-locus sequence typing. The presence of genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was determined using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period between January 2009 and December 2012, we identified 357 children, hospitalized at Primary Children's Hospital, with invasive S. aureus infections and isolates available for the study. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) caused 79% of disease, while MRSA caused only 21% of disease. Mortality associated with invasive S. aureus infection was 3.6%. The most common diagnoses were osteoarticular infections (38%) followed by central line associated blood stream infections (19%) and pneumonia (12%). We identified 41 multi-locus sequence types. The majority of isolates belonged to 6 predominant clonal complexes (CC5, CC8, CC15, CC30, CC45, CC59). PVL was present in a minority (16%) of isolates, of which most were ST8 MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: MSSA was the primary cause of invasive S. aureus infections at our institution throughout the study period. A limited number of predominant strains accounted for the majority of invasive disease. The classic virulence factor PVL was uncommon in MSSA isolates. Further study is needed to improve our understanding of S. aureus virulence and disease pathogenesis."

Bacterial pneumonia follows aspiration of recognized bacterial pathogens (RBPs) such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus after they have colonize the nasopharynx. We hypothesized that aspiration of normal respiratory flora (NRF) might also cause CAP. Methods: We studied 120 patients hospitalized for CAP who provided a high-quality sputum specimen at, or soon after admission, using Gram stain, quantitative sputum culture, bacterial speciation by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, and viral polymerase chain reaction. Thresholds for diagnosis of bacterial infection were >=105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL sputum for RBPs and >=106 cfu for NRF. Results: Recognized bacterial pathogens were found in 68 of 120 (56.7%) patients; 14 (20.1%) of these had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Normal respiratory flora were found in 31 (25.8%) patients; 10 (32.2%) had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Infection by >=2 RBPs occurred in 10 cases and by NRF together with RBPs in 13 cases. Among NRF, organisms identified as Streptococcus mitis, which share many genetic features of S pneumoniae, predominated. A respiratory virus alone was found in 16 of 120 (13.3%) patients. Overall, an etiologic diagnosis was established in 95.8% of cases. Conclusions: Normal respiratory flora, with or without viral coinfection, appear to have caused one quarter of cases of CAP and may have played a contributory role in an additional 10.8% of cases caused by RBPs. An etiology for CAP was identified in >95% of patients who provided a high-quality sputum at, or soon after, the time of admission."

CA-MRSA can cause skin and soft tissue infection in children and young active adults with no predisposing factors, and life-threatening infections such as meningitis or necrotizing pneumonia have been reported. We report here a case of CA-MRSA meningitis complicated by acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction and necrotizing pneumonia in a previously healthy 1-month-old Vietnamese boy. He was firstly treated with vancomycin, but changed to linezolid because of persistent fever and low vancomycin trough level. He recovered successfully with residual right-sided hemiparesis. The mode of transmission of CA-MRSA and the mechanism of cerebral infarction (thrombotic or embolic) were unknown. The isolate was genotyped as staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type V with a novel sequence type (ST) 5959 harboring the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene. ST 5959 is a double locus variant of ST 59, which is a major PVL-positive CA-MRSA strain isolated in invasive disease in Asian countries. This case report may serve as a warning about the dissemination of PVL-positive CA-MRSA in and around Japan, with the possibility of causing serious life-threatening disease.

Among patients with an anticipated length of stay 48 hours or longer who were undergoing mechanical ventilation at ICU admission, S aureus colonization was ascertained in the nose and lower respiratory tract. From this group, S aureus-colonized and noncolonized patients were enrolled into the study cohort in a 1:1 ratio. Data analysis was performed from May to November 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: SAIP was defined as any pneumonia during the ICU stay developing 48 hours or more after ICU admission with S aureus isolated from lower respiratory tract specimens or blood samples. The incidence of SAIP was derived in the study cohort and estimated on the weighted incidence calculation for the originating overarching population, while taking competing events into account. Weighted risk factor analysis was performed using Cox multivariable regression. Results: The study cohort consisted of 1933 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.0 [16.0] years); 1252 patients (64.8%) were men, and 950 patients (49.1%) were S aureus carriers at ICU admission. In all, 304 patients (15.7%) developed ICU-acquired pneumonia, of whom 131 patients (6.8%) had SAIP. Weighted SAIP incidences were 11.7 events per 1000 patient-days in the ICU for S aureus-colonized patients and 2.9 events per 1000 patient-days in the ICU for noncolonized patients (overall incidence, 4.9 events per 1000 patient-days in the ICU). The only factor independently associated with SAIP was S aureus colonization status at ICU admission (cause-specific hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-6.0; P < .001). There were marked regional differences in SAIP incidence and cause-specific hazard ratios for colonization status. Conclusions and Relevance: SAIP incidence was 4.9 events per 1000 ICU patient-days for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation at ICU admission (or shortly thereafter). The daily risk of SAIP was 3.6 times higher in patients colonized with S aureus at ICU admission compared with noncolonized patients."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:32997797TITLE:Prophylactic anti-staphylococcal antibiotics for cystic fibrosis.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus causes pulmonary infection in young children with cystic fibrosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are prescribed hoping to prevent such infection and lung damage. Antibiotics have adverse effects and long-term use might lead to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To assess continuous oral antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus versus no prophylaxis in people with cystic fibrosis, we tested the following hypotheses to investigate whether prophylaxis: 1. improves clinical status, lung function and survival; 2. leads to fewer isolates of Staphylococcus aureus; 3. causes adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, skin rash, candidiasis); 4. leads to fewer isolates of other common pathogens from respiratory secretions; 5. leads to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and colonisation of the respiratory tract with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Companies manufacturing anti-staphylococcal antibiotics were contacted. Most recent search of the Group's Register: 27 February 2020. Online trials registries were also searched. Most recent search of online trials registries: 15 September 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of continuous oral prophylactic antibiotics (given for at least one year) compared to intermittent antibiotics given 'as required', in people with cystic fibrosis of any disease severity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors assessed studies for eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. The review's primary outcomes of interest were lung function by spirometry (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)) and the number of people with one or more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive strains). MAIN RESULTS: We included four studies, with a total of 401 randomised participants aged zero to seven years on enrolment; one study is ongoing. The two older included studies generally had a higher risk of bias across all domains, but in particular due to a lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data, than the two more recent studies. We only regarded the most recent study as being generally free of bias, although even here we were not certain of the effect of the per protocol analysis on the study results. Evidence quality was judged to be low for all outcomes assessed after being downgraded based on GRADE assessments. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes), for imprecision and for inconsistency . Prophylactic anti-staphylococcal antibiotics probably make little or no difference to lung function measured as FEV1 % predicted after six years (mean difference (MD) -2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.59 to 8.99, one study, n = 119, low-quality evidence); but may reduce the number of children having one or more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus at two years (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35, three studies, n = 315, low-quality evidence). At the same time point, there may be little or no effect on nutrition as reported using weight z score (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.45, two studies, n = 140, low-quality evidence), additional courses of antibiotics (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60, one study, n = 119, low-quality evidence) or adverse effects (low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa between groups at two years (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.23, three studies, n = 312, low-quality evidence), though there was a trend towards a lower cumulative isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the prophylaxis group at two and three years and towards a higher rate from four to six years. As the studies reviewed lasted six years or less, conclusions cannot be drawn about the long-term effects of prophylaxis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis may lead to fewer children having isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, when commenced early in infancy and continued up to six years of age. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Further research may establish whether the trend towards more children with CF with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, after four to six years of prophylaxis, is a chance finding and whether choice of antibiotic or duration of treatment might influence this."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:33006878TITLE:Diagnosis of Community-acquired Pneumonia in Hospitalized Children: A Multicenter Experience in Bolivia.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) represents a major cause of hospitalization, especially among young children. In the third world countries, information about CAP etiology is scarce. Therefore, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic methods are crucial to determine etiological agents. METHODS: Between March 2016 and March 2017, we have prospectively studied the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular aspects of patients with CAP at 2 tertiary-level hospitals in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 274 children were evaluated, with a median age of 13 months. An etiologic agent was identified in 187 patients (68.2%): 54% (n = 148) were viruses and 14.2% (n = 39) were bacteria. CAP prevalence was highest among children under 2 years (71%; 195/274); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent cause in 22% (60/274), especially among infants, followed by influenza (14.5%; 40/274). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 7% of the total (19/274), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3%;8/274) and Haemophilus influenzae (1.4%;4/274). Together, these cases accounted for 79.5% (31/39) of all bacterial CAP. Pleural effusion (PE) complicated CAP in 13.8% (38/274), of which 29 were of bacterial etiology. RT-PCR increased the detection rate of pneumococcus by 47%. Coinfection occurred in 28 patients (10%); 26 (9.5%) required intensive care and 9 patients (3%) died. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR provided additional diagnostic value to conventional, clinical, and laboratory methods. The higher prevalence of RSV, influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the need for preventive measures with better vaccine uptake and future research for RSV vaccines."

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Six ICUs from two university-affiliated hospitals. PATIENTS: Brain-dead adult patients managed in the participating ICUs over a 4-year period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 231 included patients, 145 (62.8%) were classified as ideal or extended-criteria potential lung donors at ICU admission and the remaining 86 patients having baseline contraindication for donation. Culture-proven aspiration pneumonia and early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 54 patients (23.4%) and 15 patients (6.5%), respectively (overall pneumonia incidence, 29.9%). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacterales were the most common pathogens. Using mixed-effects Cox proportional hazard models, age (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.96-0.99]), anoxic brain injury (3.55 [1.2-10.5]), aspiration (2.29 [1.22-4.29]), and not receiving antimicrobial agents at day 1 (3.56 [1.94-6.53]) were identified as independent predictors of pneumonia occurrence in the whole study population. Analyses restricted to potential lung donors yielded similar results. Pneumonia was associated with a postadmission decrease in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio and lower values at brain death, in the whole study population (estimated marginal mean, 294 [264-323] vs 365 [346-385] mm Hg in uninfected patients; p = 0.0005) as in potential lung donors (299 [248-350] vs 379 [350-408] mm Hg; p = 0.04; linear mixed models). Lungs were eventually retrieved in 31 patients (34.4%) among the 90 potential lung donors with at least one other organ harvested (pneumonia prevalence in lung donors (9.7%) vs nondonors (49.2%); p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia occurs in one-third of brain-dead patients and appears as the main reason for lung nonharvesting in those presenting as potential lung donors. The initiation of antimicrobial prophylaxis upon the first day of the ICU stay in comatose patients with severe brain injury could enlarge the pool of actual lung donors."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:33024653TITLE:Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a systematic review.ABSTRACT:Background: The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved since the beginning of the antibiotic era. Recent guidelines encourage immediate empiric antibiotic treatment once a diagnosis of CAP is made. Concerns about treatment recommendations, on the one hand, and antibiotic stewardship, on the other, motivated this review of the medical literature on the etiology of CAP. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature on the etiology of CAP using methods defined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed using a combination of the keywords 'pneumonia', 'CAP', 'etiology', 'microbiology', 'bacteriology', and 'pathogen'. We examined articles on antibiotics that were develop to treat pneumonia. We reviewed all 'related articles' as well as studies referenced by those that came up in the search. After we excluded articles that did not give sufficient microbiological data or failed to meet other predetermined criteria, 146 studies remained. Data were stratified into diagnostic categories according to the microbiologic studies that were done; results are presented as the percentage in each category of all cases in which an etiology was established. Results: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP although declining in incidence; this decline has been greater in the US than elsewhere. Haemophilus influenzae is the second most common cause of CAP, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli. The incidence of all bacteria as causes of CAP has declined because, with routine use of PCR for viruses, the denominator, cases with an established etiology, has increased. Viruses were reported on average in about 10% of cases, but recent PCR-based studies identified a respiratory virus in about 30% of cases of CAP, with substantial rates of viral/bacterial coinfection. Conclusion: The results of this study justify current guidelines for initial empiric treatment of CAP. With pneumococcus and Haemophilus continuing to predominate, efforts at antibiotic stewardship might be enhanced by greater attention to the routine use of sputum Gram stain and culture. Because viral/bacterial coinfection is relatively common, the identification of a virus by PCR does not, by itself, allow for discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy."

We included 2827 adult patients with HAP from the Chinese Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections network admitted in 15 Chinese teaching hospitals between 2007 and 2016. Clinical data and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated pathogens were obtained from the medical records and central laboratory, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the risk factors for mortality and multidrug resistance (MDR). A total of 386 (13.7%) patients died in the hospital, while 1181 (41.8%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Active immunosuppressant therapy (OR 1.915 (95% CI 1.475-2.487)), solid tumor (OR 1.860 (95% CI 1.410-2.452)), coma (OR 1.783 (95% CI 1.364-2.333)), clinical pulmonary infection score >=7 (OR 1.743 (95% CI 1.373-2.212)), intensive care unit stay (OR 1.652 (95% CI 1.292-2.111)), age >=65 years (OR 1.621 (95% CI 1.282-2.049)), and tracheal cannula insertion (OR 1.613 (95% CI 1.169-2.224)) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Liver cirrhosis (OR 3.120 (95% CI 1.436-6.780)) and six other variables were independent predictors of MDR. Acinetobacter baumannii (25.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12.6%) were the most common pathogens (MDR prevalence 64.9%). Isolates from VAP patients showed more A. baumannii and less K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains (p < 0.001, respectively) than those from patients without VAP. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains decreased; that of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and Enterobacterales strains increased. There had been changes in the antibiotic resistance profiles of HAP pathogens in China. Risk factors for mortality and MDR are important for the selection of antimicrobials for HAP in China."

The objective of the present study is to determine the prevalence, risk factors, phenotypic and molecular characterization of MDR S. aureus isolated from HIV-positive population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the characteristics of MDR S. aureus nasal carriage among HIV-positive outpatients in an HIV clinic from June to August 2017. Nasal swabs and risk factor data of the enrolled HIV-positive outpatients were collected. Phenotypic and molecular characteristics of MDR and non-MDR S. aureus isolates were analyzed. Risk factors for nasal carriage with MDR S. aureus were estimated by logistic regression. The relationship between phenotypic and molecular characteristics of S. aureus isolates was assessed by the correspondence analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 1001 HIV-positive outpatients were included. The prevalence of MDR S. aureus nasal carriage was 15.18% (152/1001), and the proportion of multidrug resistance among S. aureus isolates was 60.08% (152/253). Having a history of respiratory tract infection was the risk factor for MDR S. aureus nasal carriage (adjusted odds ratio = 1.90, 95% confidence interval: 1.25-2.89). Multidrug resistance of S. aureus isolates was in good corresponding relationships with clonal complex (CC)5, CC15, CC59 and CC398. CONCLUSIONS: We found high burden of multidrug resistance among S. aureus isolated from HIV-positive outpatients, particularly in those who had upper respiratory tract infection. Moreover, CC59 and CC398 are highly related to multidrug resistance of S. aureus isolates."

S. capitis has been occasionally reported in infective endocarditis and rarely in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). The purpose of this report is to present the clinical course and the surgical management of a series of four patients with S. capitis PVE. METHODS: The medical records of 190 adult patients with a definite diagnosis of infective endocarditis by the Duke modified criteria and who underwent surgery at our center between January 2008 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were four cases of S. capitis infective endocarditis among 190 patients. All were male with an average age of 70.25 years (range, 58-80 years). The four cases were PVE: 3 aortic (1 mechanical and 2 biological bioprostheses) and 1 mitral (bioprosthesis). Their mean Euroscore II was 32.43 (range, 9.19-50.8). Three patients had underlying diseases (diabetes mellitus=2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease=3, chronic kidney disease=1, peripheral arterial disease=2, ischemic heart disease=1, dilated cardiomyopathy=1). Preoperative clinical presentation was characterized by the occurrence of sepsis in three patients and heart failure and sepsis in one patient. Two patients presented with vegetation (mitral bioprosthesis, aortic bioprosthesis). A prosthetic dehiscence was present in all patients, and two presented with a localized annular abscess. All but one patient received triple antibiotic treatment with vancomycin plus rifampicin plus gentamycin. Surgery was performed on an urgent basis in all patients, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 50%. CONCLUSIONS: While limited by the small number of patients, our series highlights the aggressive clinical course of S. capitis PVE with a mortality rate close to that of Staphylococcus aureus PVE. Therefore, early surgical management is recommended to improve the clinical outcome of this serious disease."

The risk of coinfections is high and responsible for a worse prognosis, mainly in the case of bacterial involvement and in the presence of particular comorbidity. We present the clinical, laboratory, radiologic characteristic along with therapeutic management of a patient with COVID-19 and Staphylococcus aureus coinfection. Case Presentation: A 55-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital due to a two-day history of fever and acute dyspnea with severe respiratory failure worsened after the administration of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. Her medical history comprehended a triple negative, BRCA1-related, PD-L1 positive right breast cancer with multiple bone metastasis, causing bone marrow infiltration-related severe pancytopenia. Her physical examination revealed scattered wheezes, rales, and bilateral dry crackles in the middle and lower lung fields and lower limb paresis. The body mass index was 30 kg/m2 and arterial blood gas evaluation revealed a stage III acute respiratory distress syndrome. Microbiological specimens revealed a Staphylococcus aureus positivity from endotracheal aspirate. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of large areas of parenchymal consolidation and aerial bronchogram, bilateral ""ground glass"" areas reaching the highest extension on the upper and middle zones. The high clinical and radiological suspicion of COVID-19 along with the negative result of nasopharyngeal specimen make necessary an endotracheal aspirate resulting positive for SARS-CoV2. Patient started an antimicrobial treatment and lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine but, unfortunately, died five days after hospital admission. Conclusion: The high risk of mortality of our patient was due to viral-bacterial coinfection, advanced cancer status with active immunotherapy. This case highlights the need for a prompt clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation to allow a correct diagnosis and start a specific therapy."

It usually results from head trauma, but there have been case reports of iatrogenic causes including on non-invasive mechanical ventilation. We report a case of pneumocephalus resulting from high mechanical ventilation pressures in a patient without prior head trauma. A 37-year-old male with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy who had been ventilator-dependent through tracheostomy was admitted for shortness of breath and intermittent fevers. The patient was found to have pneumonia, with left-lower lobe consolidation, and was started on linezolid given known Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from previous sputum culture; he was later switched to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam given persistent fevers to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient went into septic shock requiring multiple pressors as well as stress steroids for persistent shock, with eventual improvement in hemodynamics. He developed further respiratory acidosis on his usual ventilator settings, and peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) progressively increased to as high as 45-70 cm H2O during his hospital course. PIPs did not improve with suctioning or after bronchoscopy. On the 17th day of the patient's stay, he had acutely altered mental status with non-reactive fixed and dilated pupils and disconjugate gaze of the right eye on neurologic examination. CT of the head at that time revealed extensive pneumocephalus along the bifrontal convexities, suprasellar cisterns, and posterior fossa, with a possible fracture of the frontal skull base near the ethmoid roof. Mount Fuji sign was present on CT scan, indicative of ""tension pneumocephalus"". Neurosurgical consultation was obtained but the family declined intervention given his overall debilitated stated. Comfort measures were instituted, and the patient expired the following day. Pneumocephalus is the accumulation of air entry into the cranial cavity, generally from head trauma, inflammation, or surgery. Patients may have underlying base skull defects or microfractures that permit air to enter the intracranial cavity. Increased sphenoid sinus pressure from mechanical ventilation may enter the subperiosteal space, allowing air to enter the intracranial cavity. It is important to consider pneumocephalus in a patient with new neurological findings after mechanical ventilation."

The relationship between findings of the upper airways and CF lung disease is not yet completely understood. Objective  The aim of the present study is to describe the most frequent nasal findings and pathogens in patients with CF and investigate the association between the findings of the upper respiratory tract and markers of lung disease progression. Methods  Retrospective study in patients with CF from the Pediatric Pulmonology Department who underwent otorhinolaryngological evaluation between 2015 and 2017. Nasal endoscopy and nasal swab collection were part of the evaluation. The severity markers used were: percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1%), body mass index (BMI) and the Shwachman-Kulczycki (SK) clinical score. Results  A total of 48 patients with CF were included. The mean of the predicted percentage of FEV1% was 83.36 +- 30.04. The average 14 and SK score 89.11 +- 10.50. The bacteriology of the nasal swab was positive in 27 (54.1%) patients. Staphylococcus aureus was positive in 18 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5, Pseudomonas cepacea in 3 and Stenotrophomonas maltophila in 1 patient. Nasal polyps were found in nine participants. Nasal polyps were found in nine participants and were associated with lower SK score. Conclusion  The pathogens found in the upper airway were, in order: S. aureus , P. aeruginosa , P. cepacea e S. maltophila .

METHODS: For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. CONCLUSION: The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed."

Tissue cultures revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus He was treated successfully with 6 weeks of culture-guided intravenous oxacillin, staphylococcal decontamination and first-line anti-TB regimen (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide). Antiretroviral agents were started thereafter. Successful infection control and preservation of limb functionality was achieved with a multidisciplinary team approach. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of an adult patient with HIV presenting with tuberculous and pyogenic osteomyelitis of the radial bone."

Methods: We studied two sampling sets (Set 1 and Set 2). Set 1 consisted of results of testing 3382 assays of out-patients and hospital patients (5-88 years old) with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia of yet undetermined aetiology. Set 2 contained results of 1204 assays of hospital patients (12-94 years old) with pneumonia and COVID-19 already diagnosed by molecular biological techniques in test laboratories. The results were collected in twelve Russian cities/provinces in time range 2 March - 5 May 2020. Assays were analysed for 10 bacterial, 15 viral, 2 fungal and 2 parasitic aetiological agents. Results: In Set 1, 4.35% of total pneumonia cases were related to SARS-CoV-2, with substantially larger proportion (18.75%) of deaths of pneumonia with COVID-19 diagnosed. However, studying Set 2, we revealed that 52.82% patients in it were also positive for different typical and atypical aetiological agents usually causing pneumonia. 433 COVID-19 patients (35.96%) were tested positive for various bacterial aetiological agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infections accounting for the majority of secondary pneumonia cases. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a COVID-19 patient as a complication. An essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Russia in March-May 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. The problem of hospital-acquired bacterial infection is exceptionally urgent in treating SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia and its further complications, should be given very serious attention in combating SARS-CoV-2."

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 47 episodes in 45 patients diagnosed with definite/possible IE according to the modified Duke criteria between May 2000 and March 2018. RESULTS: The mean age of all patients at the time of diagnosis was 7.6+-4.7 years (range: 2.4 months to 16 years). The most common symptoms and findings were fever (89.3%), leukocytosis (80.8%), splenomegaly (70.2%), and a new heart murmur or changing of pre-existing murmur (68%). Streptococcus viridans (19.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.8%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (10.6%) were the most commonly isolated agents. IE-related complications developed in 27.6% of the patients and the mortality rate was 14.8%. CONCLUSION: We found that congenital heart disease remains a significant risk factor for IE. The highest risk groups included operated patients who had conduits in the pulmonary position and unoperated patients with a large ventricular septal defect. Surgical intervention was required in most of the patients. Mortality rate was high, especially in patients infected with S. aureus, although the time between the onset of the first symptom and diagnosis was short. Patients with fever and a high risk of IE should be carefully examined for IE, and evaluation in favor of IE until proven otherwise will be more accurate. In high-risk patients with prolonged fever, IE should be considered in the differential diagnosis."

This study investigated etiologies and patterns of URTI among children in Mwanza, Tanzania. A cross-sectional study involving 339 children was conducted between October-2017 and February-2018. Children with features suggestive of URTI such as nasal congestion, dry cough, painful swallowing and nasal discharge with/without fever were enrolled. Pathogens were detected from nasopharyngeal and ear-swabs by multiplex-PCR and culture respectively. Full blood count and C-reactive protein analysis were also done. The median age was 16 (IQR: 8-34) months. Majority (82.3%) had fever and nasal-congestion (65.5%). Rhinitis (55.9%) was the commonest diagnosis followed by pharyngitis (19.5%). Viruses were isolated in 46% of children, the commonest being Rhinoviruses (23.9%). Nineteen percent of children had more than 2 viruses; Rhinovirus and Enterovirus being the commonest combination. The commonest bacteria isolated from ears were Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Children with viral pathogens had significantly right shift of lymphocytes (73%-sensitivity). Majority (257/339) of children were symptoms free on eighth day. Viruses are the commonest cause of URTI with Rhinitis being the common diagnosis. Rapid diagnostic assays for URTI pathogens are urgently needed in low-income countries to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions which is associated with antibiotic resistance."

Our aim was to comparatively analyze the incidence, epidemiology, and outcomes of secondary pneumonia in adult patients hospitalized with influenza versus noninfluenza viral infections and determine whether influenza particularly predisposes to secondary infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis from a single tertiary medical center of adult patients admitted to the hospital between 2008 and 2010 with respiratory viral infections. Microbiological patterns and clinical outcomes were compared between those with influenza (VI, n = 57) and those with noninfluenza (NI, n = 77) respiratory viral infections. RESULTS: The NI group was older (60.6 +- 14.0 versus 53.3 +- 19.7 years, p = 0.019) with higher rates of lung transplantation (29% versus 9%, p = 0.009) than VI. Overall, 35% developed secondary pneumonia, higher among NI (44%) than VI (23%, p = 0.017). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of pneumonia in VI, whereas Gram-negative rods were most frequently identified in NI. The NI group had longer hospital [median 10 (interquartile range (IQR) 6-19) versus 6 (IQR 4-15) days, p = 0.019] and intensive care unit [median 4 (IQR 0-12) versus 0 (IQR 0-8) days, p = 0.029] stays compared with VI. Further, the NI group was more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit compared with VI (62% versus 39%, p = 0.011). A trend towards increased mortality was observed in viral infections complicated by secondary pneumonia than primary viral infections (28% versus 15%, p = 0.122). CONCLUSION: Secondary pneumonia is common among adults hospitalized with viral respiratory infections. Within our population, NI results in more frequent secondary pneumonia and longer hospital stays than those with VI. Given the high number of infections caused by Gram-negative rods, monitoring local epidemiology is critical for guiding initial antibiotic selection in empirical treatment of secondary infections.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section."

Patients The study participants consisted of 7 crewmembers of the passenger cruise-liner, Diamond Princess, who were admitted to our hospital after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 aboard the ship. Methods The data on patient background and biochemical test results were obtained from the patients' medical records. All patients had a chest X-ray, and a throat swab and sputum samples were sent for culture on admission. Results The median age of the 7 patients, of whom 4 were male and 3 were female, was 39 years (range: 23-47 years). On admission, none of them had fever, but 4 (57%) had a cough. None of them showed any signs of organ damage on laboratory testing. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in one individual, which resolved spontaneously, while the other 6 had normal chest X-ray findings. Culture of throat swabs and sputum samples revealed that 4 patients (57%) had bacterial upper respiratory infections (Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus). The period from a positive PCR test to negative conversion ranged from 5 to 13 days, with a median of 8 days. Conclusion Healthy young adults without risk factors who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an asymptomatic infection or may experience mild COVID-19. In addition to obesity, an older age, underlying illness, and being overweight can lead to a risk of exacerbation; thus, hospital management for such individuals may be desirable. Culturing respiratory samples may be useful for diagnosing secondary bacterial pneumonia."

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and microbial features, and outcome of patients with invasive staphylococcal infection. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the children admitted to PICU with invasive staphylococcal infections. Invasive staphylococcal infection was defined as clinical infection with isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from a normally sterile body site. Results: A total of 50 children (1 month to 16 years) were identified with staphylococcal infections during the study period. There was male preponderance (75%) with high prevalence in school going children. Among these children, 36% (18) were coagulase-negative (CONS), which were excluded. Of the remaining, 64% (32) were coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, 54% (27) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 10% (5) were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Community-acquired staphylococcal infections were present in 24 children (CA-MRSA). Pneumonia with empyema was the most common 20 (62%) site of primary staphylococcal infection, followed by blood stream infection 9 (28%) and skin and soft tissue infection 3 (9%). Of the soft tissue infection, three were MRSA, with two had pyopericardium with infective endocarditis. Resistance in MSSA was found to be maximum to penicillin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin with no resistance with vancomycin. Conclusion: There is an increase incidence of MRSA among community-acquired staphylococcal infections requiring intensive care management. A larger study on clinical profile of Staphylococcus infection in pediatrics is urgently needed to define the exact magnitude of the problem.

METHODS: This was an observational study of prospectively collected data of consecutive adults with CAP and a definitive etiology enrolled between 2004 and 2018. Patients were divided into MSSA CAP and pneumococcal CAP groups for analysis. RESULTS: A microbial etiology was established in 1,548 (33%) cases: S. aureus caused 6% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases. In the latter, 52 were due to MSSA (60% of S. aureus CAP cases, and 3% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases) and 34 were due to MRSA (40% of S. aureus CAP cases, and 2% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases). S. pneumoniae was identified in 734 (47%) microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases. The presence of fever was independently associated with a lower risk of MSSA CAP (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.99). Patients with MSSA CAP had higher 30-day mortality than patients with pneumococcal CAP, both before and after adjustment for potential confounders (21% vs 7%, p=0.002). MSSA was independently associated with 30-day mortality in the overall population. CONCLUSION: MSSA CAP was associated with worse outcomes than pneumococcal CAP in our cohort.

Epidemiology is underknown and underdiagnosis is likely. Recent travel abroad, case clustering and relapsing disease are often reported. We reviewed all cases of PVL-SA infection diagnosed at our center, and found 21 cases over a 43-month period. Most patients were adult males, had relevant travel history, reported recurrent disease and presented with SSTI. Etiologic diagnosis took up to five years; meanwhile, 42% of patients had antibiotic treatments. Draining procedures were required in 43% of patients and intensive care support in 19%. All patients recovered. Methicillin-resistance prevalence was 24%. Only 2/13 decolonized patients had posterior relapsing SSTI, both with likely infected contacts. PVL-SA infection's severity and impact are clear, even in small case series as ours. Physician awareness and active PVL-gene search are crucial for an adequate management."

Drug-resistant pathogens are one of the major challenges to control. The study aimed to identify the major etiological agents, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated factors of septicemia among pediatric patients in southern Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pediatric patients. Blood samples were cultured and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion techniques. Data were collected by pre-tested questionnaire to identify potential associated factors of septicemia. A bivariate logistic regression analysis was used and adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI at <=0.05 level of significance was computed to determine the presence and strength of the association. Results: Of 238 participants, 27 (11.3%) of them had a positive blood culture. Staphylococcus aureus (32.2%), coagulase negative Staphylococci (25%), and Klebsiella pneumonia e (14.3%) were the predominant isolates. The isolated bacteria showed high rates of resistance to amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin and ampicillin. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was observed in 82.1% of the isolates. Being infant [AOR=4.18, 95% CI, (1.3-13.0)], admission >10 days [AOR=5.54, 95% CI, (1.51-20.41)], burn [AOR=3.55, 95% CI, (1.02-12.38)] and wound cases [AOR=5.52, 95% CI, (1.50-20.34)] were associated with pediatric septicemia. Conclusion: Gram positive bacteria were the predominant isolates and majority of isolates were MDR pathogens. Very young age, prolonged hospital stays, burn and wound cases were associated with pediatric septicemia. Establishing antibiotic stewardship is mandatory to minimize the high prevalence of drug resistance."

We evaluated the impact of a multi-modal IPC strategy originally designed for the containment of COVID-19 on the rates of other hospital-acquired-infections (HAIs). METHODOLOGY: From February-August 2020, a multi-modal IPC strategy was implemented across a large healthcare campus in Singapore, comprising improved segregation of patients with respiratory symptoms, universal masking and heightened adherence to Standard Precautions. The following rates of HAI were compared pre- and post-pandemic: healthcare-associated respiratory-viral-infection (HA-RVI), MRSA and CP-CRE acquisition rates, healthcare-facility-associated C.difficile infections (HCFA-CDI) and device-associated HAIs. RESULTS: Enhanced IPC measures introduced to contain COVID-19 had the unintended positive consequence of containing HA-RVI. The cumulative incidence of HA-RVI decreased from 9.69 cases per 10,000 patient-days to 0.83 cases per 10,000 patient-days (incidence-rate-ratio=0.08; 95%CI=0.05-0.13, p<0.05). Hospital-wide MRSA acquisition rates declined significantly during the pandemic (incidence-rate-ratio=0.54, 95%CI=0.46-0.64, p<0.05), together with central-line-associated-bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates (incidence-rate-ratio=0.24, 95%CI=0.07-0.57, p<0.05); likely due to increased compliance with Standard Precautions. Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, there was no increase in CP-CRE acquisition, and rates of other HAIs remained stable. CONCLUSION: Multimodal IPC strategies can be implemented at scale to successfully mitigate healthcare-associated transmission of RVIs. Good adherence to personal-protective-equipment and hand hygiene kept other HAI rates stable even during an ongoing pandemic where respiratory infections were prioritized for interventions."

Since the age of 8 years, the patient had undergone repeated abdominal and mediastinal cyst surgeries and had received a diagnosis of lymphangiomatosis. At this time, she showed a high fever of 38.5 C. Cultures of both blood and fluid aspirated from the cyst were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Chest CT imaging revealed an enlarged right-sided mediastinal cystic lymphangioma with new septa in it. A chest tube was inserted into the cyst to remove effusion. The patient was then started with the antibacterial drug cefazolin at 3 g/d. But effective drainage was difficult because of the high viscosity of the effusion and septa working as barriers. We removed these components with endoscopic surgical instruments and via a pulsed-lavage system under general anesthesia. Postoperative CT images showed reexpanded lung structure and reduced cyst size. The patient has taken a favorable course for 2 years."

We aimed to investigate pulmonary manifestations by computed tomography (CT). In total, 100 patients with 117 episodes of pulmonary infection were included. Chest CT scans of every episode were analyzed. Random nodules were the most common findings (79.49%), followed by ground-grass opacities (74.36%), focal consolidations (62.39%), and masses (59.83%). Cavities (12.82%) and multiple small abscesses (17.09%) could be found in the consolidations and masses. CT revealed interstitial pneumonia with tree-in-bud opacities (17.09%), interlobular septal thickening (23.08%) and emphysema (35.04%), which were more severe in the bilateral upper lobes. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (78.63%) and axillary lymphadenopathy (65.81%) were common. Fungal infection (n = 27) was the most common and presented with multiple nodules and masses. Approximately 1/4 of fungal infections had interstitial pneumonia. In Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) infections, large areas of consolidation were common. In tuberculosis infection, the pulmonary infections were more severe and complex. For Bacillus Calmette-Guerin disease, left-sided axillary lymphadenopathy was a characteristic manifestation.

Methicillin-resistance is due to a penicillin-binding protein, which has a low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Excess and inappropriate use of clindamycin have led to the emergence of resistant Staphylococcal strains. Cancer patients are at high risk of bacterial colonization due to cancer chemotherapy which leads to severe and prolonged immunosuppression. This study aimed to assess the carriage rate of inducible clindamycin and MRSA among cancer patients. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 cancer patients from January to August 2019. Sociodemographic data and nasal swab samples were collected and inoculated on mannitol salt agar and then incubated at 37 C for 24 hours. The identification of isolates was done by colony characteristics and biochemical reactions. MRSA was detected using cefoxitin disc and inducible clindamycin resistance detected using D-test. Interpretations of antibiotics susceptibility was done using CLSI 2018. Finally, data was entered, cleared, and checked using Epi-info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Logistic regression was used for statistical association. p-value <= 0.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In this study, of the 59 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, 22% (13/59) were MRSA and 78% (46/59) were MSSA. MRSA carriage rate in females was 18.6% (11/59) whereas in males it was 3.4% (2/59). MRSA carriage among urban residents (15.3% (9/59)) was higher than their rural counterparts (6.8% (4/59)). The prevalence of inducible clindamycin resistance was 17% (10/59). Multi-drug resistance patterns among Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 55.9% (33/59). Clindamycin (84.6%), chloramphenicol (84.6%), and ciprofloxacin (69.2%) were the most effective whereas penicillin (100%), tetracycline (76.9%), and erythromycin (76.9%) were the least effective for MRSA isolates. Urban living, being illiterate, being employed, patients with liver and lung cancer were significantly associated with MRSA carriage. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed high rates of MRSA carriage and inducible clindamycin resistance with the percentages of 22 and 17, respectively. Therefore, decolonization of MRSA carriers and rational usage of antibiotics should be implemented."

METHODS: We pooled the susceptibility and clinical data of CAP patients enrolled in five clinical trials conducted in three countries from 2006 to 2017. The published pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of oral (500 mg) and intravenous (IV; 500, 650, and 750 mg) nemonoxacin formulations and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of the two aforementioned CAP-related Gram-positive cocci (GPC) were used to determine plausible CBPs. Moreover, the nemonoxacin MIC distributions of CAP-relatedS. pneumoniae (n = 1,800) and S. aureus (n = 2,000) isolates were obtained to evaluate the ECOFF values using a visual estimation approach and ECOFFinder. RESULTS: More than 92% of the patients with CAP caused byS. pneumoniae or S. aureus with nemonoxacin MICs<=0.25 mg/L presented positive clinical and microbiological outcomes. The ECOFF, MIC90, and MIC99 values of nemonoxacin were 0.06, 0.125, and 1 mg/L, respectively, for the S. pneumoniae isolates, and 0.125, 1, and 8 mg/L for the S. aureus isolates, respectively. Based on the differences in the PK profiles of oral and IV formulations, PD parameters of nemonoxacin for these CAP-GPC, and clinical in vivo efficacy data, tentative CBPs of 0.5, 0.5, and 1 mg/L were established for the 500-mg oral and 500- and 750-mg IV nemonoxacin formulations, respectively, for S. pneumoniae, and 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/L, respectively, for S. aureus.

Risk factors associated with right-sided infective endocarditis are commonly related to intravenous drug abuse, central venous catheters, or infections due to implantable cardiac devices. However, patients with congenital ventricular septal defects might be at high risk of endocarditis and haemodynamic complications. CASE PRESENTATION: In the following, we present the case of a 23-year-old man without a previous intravenous drug history with tricuspid valve Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis complicated by acute renal failure and haemoptysis caused by multiple pulmonary emboli. In most cases, right-sided endocarditis is associated with several common risk factors, such as intravenous drug abuse, a central venous catheter, or infections due to implantable cardiac devices. In this case, we found a small perimembranous ventricular septal defect corresponding to a type 2 Gerbode defect. This finding raised the suspicion of a congenital ventricular septal defect complicated by a postendocarditis aneurysmal transformation. CONCLUSIONS: Management of the complications of right-sided infective endocarditis requires a multidisciplinary approach. Echocardiographic approaches should include screening for ventricular septal defects in patients without common risk factors for tricuspid valve endocarditis. Patients with undiagnosed congenital ventricular septal defects are at high risk of infective endocarditis. Therefore, endocarditis prophylaxis after dental procedures and/or soft-tissue infections is highly recommended. An acquired ventricular septal defect is a very rare complication of infective endocarditis. Surgical management of small ventricular septal defects without haemodynamic significance is still controversial."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:33228818TITLE:Evaluation of the negative predictive value of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nasal swab screening in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal swabs are utilized to guide the discontinuation of empiric MRSA therapy. In multiple studies, MRSA nasal swabs have been shown to have a negative predictive value (NPV) of ~99% in non-oncology patients with pneumonia and other infections. We evaluated the performance characteristics of a negative MRSA nasal swab in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) populaion to determine its NPV. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PATIENTS: This study included adult AML patients with a suspected infection and a MRSA nasal swab collected between 2013 and 2018. METHODS: MRSA nasal swab and culture-documented infections were identified to determine the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value of the MRSA nasal swabs. RESULTS: In total, 194 patients were identified, and 484 discrete encounters were analyzed. Overall, 468 (97%) encounters had a negative MRSA nasal swab upon admission with no cultured documented MRSA infection during their hospitalization. However, 3 encounters (0.6%) had a negative MRSA nasal swab with a subsequent cultured documented MRSA infection during their admission. Identified infections were bacteremia (n = 2) and confirmed pneumonia (n = 1). MRSA nasal swab had a sensitivity of 62% (95% CI, 0.24-0.91), specificity of 98% (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), positive predictive value of 38% (95% CI, 0.21-0.6), and NPV of 99% (95% CI, 0.98-1). CONCLUSIONS: A negative MRSA nasal swab has a 99% NPV for subsequent MRSA infections in AML patients with no prior history of MRSA colonization or infection. Based on these findings, a negative MRSA nasal swab can help guide de-escalation of empiric MRSA antibiotic therapy."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus aureusID:33243022TITLE:Safety considerations of current drug treatment strategies for nosocomial pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Introduction: Nosocomial pneumonia unfortunately remains a frequent event for which appropriate antibiotic treatment is central to improving outcomes. Physicians must choose an early and appropriate empirical treatment, basing their decision on the safety profile and possible side effects. Areas covered: In this review, we analyzed the safety profiles of the most common antimicrobials for treating nosocomial pneumonia. Beta-lactams are used most often for these infections, with a high percentage (6% to 25%) of patients reporting allergy or hypersensitivity reactions; however, exhaustive evaluation is key because it seems possible to de-label as many as 90% by proper assessment. Combinations including a beta-lactam are recommended in patients with risk factors for drug-resistant microorganisms and septic shock. Although aminoglycosides are safe for 3-5 days of therapy, renal function should be monitored. Fluoroquinolones must also be used with care given the risk of collagen degradation and cardiovascular events, mainly aneurysm or aortic dissection. Linezolid or vancomycin are both viable for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but linezolid seems to be the superior option. Antibiotic stewardships programs must be developed for each center. Expert opinion: Choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial based on information from national and international guidelines, local microbiology data, and stewardship programs may reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Daily assessment for the emergence of adverse events related to antimicrobial use is essential."

METHODS: This study included all the cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the ICU between the period of January 2018 to December 2019. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients in pneumonia were included. Mortality rate was 45.9%. In patients with HAP had higher length of stay days in hospital and ICU, the use of sedative agents, sepsis rate and mortality rate as compared in patients with CAP (for all p<0.05). Microorganism was identified in 27(36.6%) of the patients. Respiratory samples were positive in 25.4% of patients with CAP and 60.8% of patients with HAP. Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent etiologic agents (40.7% and 22.2%, respectively). Acinetobacter baumannii was not susceptible to the third generation cephalosporin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, fluoroquinolone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Among gram-positive bacteria, the most common isolate was staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 75% but these isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The predominance of gram-negative agents was observed in pneumonia patients and due to the high resistance to antibiotics, treatment strategies need to be reconsidered in order to improve the poor prognosis."

METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study, patients >= 18 year old who had SBI (Glasgow coma scale GCS score < 9) who received mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h were analysed. The main objective was to identify risk factors for S. aureus VAP vs VAP due to other pathogens and to identify risk factors for S. aureus VAP vs patients who did not experience VAP. RESULTS: 847 patients with SBI were admitted in ICU after severe traumatic brain injury (n = 489, 58%), aneurysmal SAH (n = 156, 18%), stroke (n = 27, 3%), spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (n = 80, 9%), arteriovenous malformation rupture (n = 25, 3%), and other causes (n = 70, 8%). Three hundred fifty of 847 patients (41%) had VAP with S. aureus (n = 161) or other pathogens (n = 189). In patients with VAP, the multivariate analysis shows that age per 10 years of ageing (OR 0.80, 95%CI [0.70; 0.90]; p < 0.001) and no tobacco use (OR 0.54, 95%CI [0.33;0.88]; p = 0.014) were protective factors against S. aureus. Age per 10 years of ageing remained a protective factor against S. aureus VAP vs no VAP (OR 0.80, 95%CI [0.73; 0.89], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study involving patients with SBI and who experienced VAP, increased age and no tobacco use were protective factors against VAP due to S. aureus. Increased age remained protective against S. aureus in VAP vs no VAP analysis."

We aimed to describe common aetiologies of acute febrile illness among children in a setting where malaria transmission has declined. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged at least 2 months and under 13 years presenting with fever (temperature of >=37.5  C or a history of fever in the past 48 h) to Hawassa Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, southern Ethiopia, from May 2018 through February 2019. Clinical and demographic data were gathered for consecutive participants, and malaria microscopy, HIV testing, and blood and urine cultures were performed regardless of clinical presentation. Additionally, stool analyses (culture and rotavirus/adenovirus RDT) and throat swab for group A Streptococcus (GAS) and urine Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed by RDTs for children with specific conditions. The antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates was determined using disc diffusion method. RESULTS: During the study period 433 children were recruited, median age 20 months (range, 2 months - 12 years) and 178 (41.1%) female. Malaria was diagnosed in 14 (3.2%) of 431 children, and 3 (0.7%) had HIV infection. Bacteraemia or fungaemia was detected in 27 (6.4%) of 421 blood cultures, with Staphylococcus aureus isolated in 16 (3.8%). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were detected in 74 (18.4%) of 402, with Escherichia coli isolated in 37 (9.2%). Among 56 children whose stool specimens were tested, 14 (25%) were positive for rotavirus, 1 (1.8%) for Salmonella Paratyphi A, and 1 (1.8%) for Shigella dysenteriae. Among those with respiratory symptoms, a throat swab test for GAS and urine test for S. pneumoniae were positive in 28 (15.8%) of 177 and 31 (17.0%) of 182, respectively. No test was positive for a pathogen in 266 (61.4%) of 433 participants. Bacterial isolates were frequently resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION: Our results showed low proportions of malaria and bacteraemia among febrile children. In contrast, the frequent detection of UTI emphasize the need to support enhanced diagnostic capacity to ensure appropriate antimicrobial intervention."

The impact of secondary S. aureus bacteremia on mortality in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unknown. Methods: This was a retrospective observational case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed secondary S. aureus bacteremia across 2 New York City hospitals. The primary end point was to describe 14-day and 30-day hospital mortality rates of patients with COVID-19 and S. aureus bacteremia. Secondary end points included predictors of 14-day and 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 and S. aureus bacteremia. Results: A total of 42 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with secondary S. aureus bacteremia were identified. Of these patients, 23 (54.8%) and 28 (66.7%) died at 14 days and 30 days, respectively, from their first positive blood culture. Multivariate analysis identified hospital-onset bacteremia (>=4 days from date of admission) and age as significant predictors of 14-day hospital mortality and Pitt bacteremia score as a significant predictor of 30-day hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 11.9; 95% CI, 2.03-114.7; P = .01; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P = .02; and OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19-2.18; P = .003, respectively). Conclusions: Bacteremia with S. aureus is associated with high mortality rates in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Further investigation is warranted to understand the impact of COVID-19 and secondary S. aureus bacteremia."

During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy."

Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis."

Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness. Viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia; infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with Gram-negative organisms. An increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. Distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult; diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiological findings, and microbiological results. Recommended empiric therapy should consider factors such as the time of onset of illness, severity of disease, and specific risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, including use of mechanical ventilation, underlying disease, or recent use of antibacterials. The resident local hospital flora should be considered when selecting therapy for nosocomial pneumonia. Early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. For empiric treatment of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia, an intravenous antibacterial regimen that includes coverage of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive organisms should be used. A carbapenem or ureidopenicillin derivative (piperacillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor should be used where extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are endemic. Therapy should be modified when a specific pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility are identified. Effective prevention of nosocomial pneumonia requires infection control measures that affect the environment, personnel, and patients. Of these, hand hygiene, appropriate infection control policies, and judicious use of antibacterials are essential."

Physicians were concerned about the possibility of concurrent serious bacterial infections, especially in infants younger than 3 months and in those with infiltrates present on the chest x-ray films. OBJECTIVE: To report the frequency of concurrent serious bacterial infections in infants and children hospitalized for treatment of RSV lower respiratory tract infections. METHODS: The medical records of 2396 infants and children admitted to Driscoll Children's Hospital with RSV bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia during 7 RSV seasons from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1998, were reviewed. RESULTS: There were positive cultures obtained from initial sepsis/meningitis workups on admission in 39 infants and children (1.6%). Of these, 12 (31%) were positive blood cultures and 27 (69%) were positive urine cultures. There were no positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures. All of the positive blood cultures contained either Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, or Bacillus species, which are common contaminants. None of the patients received a standard 10-day course of intravenous antibiotic therapy. All of the positive urine cultures were typical urinary tract pathogens. All of the patients were treated. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent serious bacterial infections are rare in infants and children hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infections and the empiric use of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is unnecessary in children with typical signs and symptoms of RSV bronchiolitis."

We tested the hypothesis that HIV infection might be associated with increased bacterial colonisation of distal airways by nasal flora, which would then predispose patients to bacterial pneumonia. METHODS: Healthy volunteer adults with normal chest radiographs were recruited. Bronchoscopy was carried out and uncontaminated mucosal samples were collected from proximal and distal sites in the large airways using a protected specimen brush. Samples were cultured to detect typical respiratory tract colonising organisms, and the proportion of samples found to contain colonising bacteria compared between HIV infected and uninfected subjects using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Forty-nine subjects were studied of whom 27 were HIV infected. Colonising bacteria were identified in the nasopharynx of all subjects including Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6/49 subjects (5 HIV uninfected). Colonising bacteria were found in the distal airway of 6 subjects (3/27 HIV infected vs 3/22 HIV uninfected; chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.8). Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in the trachea of all subjects with nasal colonisation but in the distal airway of only 1 subject.

All episodes of culture proven NBSI occurring after 96 h of hospitalisation were identified retrospectively during a 10-year period (1991-2001). Throughout the study period, the use of antenatal steroids, demographic characteristics and morbidity of the patients were recorded prospectively. Since 1996 more efforts were made to use antenatal steroids to decrease neonatal morbidity and mortality. The incidence rates of NBSI were compared between period 1 (1991-1995) and period 2 (1996-2001). The overall incidence rate of NBSI dropped significantly from 7.4% (6.1%-8.9%) in period 1 to 5.0% (4.0%-6.2%) in period 2 and was most pronounced in the birth weight category 1000 g-1500 g (11.7%, 7.9%-15.0% to 6.9%, 4.3%-10.5%) and 1500 g-2500 g (3.6%, 2.2%-5.6% to 1.4%, 0.6%-2.8%). Antenatal use of steroids increased overall from 19% in 1991 to 51% in 2001 ( P&lt;0.001). Since 1996 there was a decreasing number of ventilation days ( P=0.011) and decreasing incidence of patent ductus arteriosus ( P=0.001), while the incidence of neonatal surgery, chronic lung disease and duration of hospitalisation remained constant over time. CONCLUSION: increased use of antenatal steroids is associated with a decreasing incidence rate of nosocomial bloodstream infections in neonates with birth weights between 1000 g and 2500 g, probably by decreasing the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus and/or due to improved respiratory outcome. This finding needs to be confirmed by randomised control trials or by a large prospective cohort study in similar population groups."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A 260-bed community referral center. PATIENTS: Case-patients were patients with S. epidermidis mediastinitis, endocarditis, or both after valve implantation at Hospital de La Ribera from January to June 2002. The study population included patients undergoing valve surgery at Hospital de La Ribera from January 2000 to June 2002. RESULTS: From January to June 2002, 8 cases of mediastinitis, endocarditis, or both occurred among 53 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In the same months of 2000, there had been no cases among 22 patients, and in 2001, only 1 case among 47 patients (P = .095 and P = .034, respectively). In 2002, there were 4 cases of mediastinitis and endocarditis, 3 cases of mediastinitis, and 1 case of endocarditis, all following aortic valve replacement. The epidemic curve suggested a protracted outbreak. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease were six-fold more likely to be case-patients (95% confidence interval, 1.6-23.8). The mean duration of surgery tended to be longer in non-case-patients (161.4 +/- 57.9 minutes) than in case-patients (123.7 +/- 23.7 minutes) (P = .06).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From November 2000 to December 2003, 93 total laparoscopic bypass procedures were performed to treat TASC (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus document) grade C or D aortoiliac occlusive lesions. We also reimplanted 2 inferior mesenteric arteries, and performed 3 prosthesis-superior mesenteric bypasses and 2 suprarenal aorta endarterectomies. Our technique includes a sloping right lateral decubitus installation, which enables a simple transperitoneal left retrocolic or retrorenal approach to the infrarenal abdominal aorta. In patients with a hostile abdomen a retroperitoneal videoscopic approach was used. Aorta-prosthesis laparoscopic anastomoses are performed simply, which averts any trauma to the suture material. RESULTS: Patients included 76 men and 17 women, with median patient age 61 years (range, 38-79 years). The approach to the aorta was always possible, in particular, in obese patients. It enabled stable aortic exposure during performance of the laparoscopic aorta-prosthesis anastomosis. Median operative time was 240 minutes (range, 150-450 minutes). Median aortic clamping time measured to unclamping of the first prosthetic limb was 67.5 minutes (range, 30-135 minutes). Median duration of aorta-prosthesis anastomosis was 30 minutes (range, 12-90 minutes). The longest durations were mainly observed during the learning curve. Thirty-day postoperative mortality was 4% (4 of 93 patients). Two patients died of myocardial infarction. One patient with American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 4 disease operated on to treat critical ischemia died of multiple organ system failure, and 1 patient died of colonic ischemia. Major nonlethal postoperative complications were observed in 4 patients, and included lung atelectasia in 2 patients, graft infection in 1 patient operated on emergently to treat aortic occlusion, and secondary spleen rupture at day 5 in 1 patient. Median hospital stay was 7 days (range, 2-57 days). With a mean follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-37 months), complete recovery was observed in 89 patients, and all grafts were patent. One patient had kinking of a prosthetic limb at the groin, and in 1 patient Staphylococcus epidermidis graft infection developed, which was treated with in situ replacement with a rifampin-bonded graft. CONCLUSION: Total laparoscopic aortic bypass is feasible. In patients with TASC C and D aortoiliac occlusive lesions, short-term outcomes are comparable to those with conventional aortic bypass. After the initial learning curve, laparoscopic technique may reduce the operative trauma of aortic bypass."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus epidermidisID:15926085TITLE:[Critical odontogenic infection involving the mediastinum. Case report].ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Occasionally, trivial odontogenic infections may develop into complex diseases. This may even result in an unrestrained phlegmonous spread causing life-threatening complications. These problems have decreased since the introduction of antibiotics and also due to improved oral hygiene and improved diagnostic measures resulting in optimized medical treatment. However, life-threatening forms are still seen, in particular if infections spread along the cervical fascial sheaths down towards to the mediastinum. Over the past decade the number of critical infections has increased in other medical specialties. This is usually explained by the development of multiresistant pathogens in the context of nosocomial infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the patients' records of the past 15 years at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospital Kiel to assess a possible increase of odontogenic infections with life-threatening complications. From 1990 to 2004, four patients with odontogenic infections exhibiting critical phlegmonous spread were treated in the intensive care unit. Two patients developed bacterial mediastinitis which could be controlled by intravenous antibiotics only. One patient progressed to general septic mediastinitis and eventually died of cardiorespiratory arrest. The last patient also had septic mediastinitis and developed right pleural empyema. Several operations were necessary before the disease could be controlled. This patient's case report is presented in detail. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of patients with mediastinitis crucially depends on (a) early diagnosis including computed tomography of the neck and thorax, (b) early radical surgical intervention, and (c) optimized pathogen-oriented antibiotic treatment."

The authors present 9 patients with splenic abscess treated at the Institute of Digestive System Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, in a period from January 1, 1986 to May 15, 2004. Splenic abscess was the complication of septic endocarditis in 4, trauma in 2, dental infection in 1, while in 2 cases it was the complication of chemotherapy in myeloproliferative disorders. All 9 patients had fever, 7 - abdominal pain, 4 - left shoulder pain, and 1 patient had nausea and vomiting. Higher white blood count was found in 6 patients, pleural effusion in 4, elevated left hemidiaphragm in 1 and basal pneumonia in 1 patient as well. Ultrasonography and CT were the most reliable diagnostic procedures. CT was superior in diagnosis of multiple small abscesses. Culture of the pus recovered the Enterococcus in 3 cases, Streptococcus a hemolyticus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans in 1, Staphylococcus aureus, E. Coil and Candida albicans in 1, Staphylococcus aureus i Salmonella enteritidis in 1 case. Eight patients underwent splenectomy and 1 was cured by combined antibiotics in high doses. One patient died postoperatively due to septic endocarditis that had been present before surgery. The authors believe that splenectomy and antibiotics administered according to drug susceptibility test as well as management of underlying disease are the method of choice for splenic abscess treatment. Conservative antibiotic treatment is indicated in selected cases only."

Twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. The lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and CIEP. CIEP was done to detect the bacterial antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. Low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. Altogether, a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). In 10 babies, Strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. Micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. Eleven babies (25%) grew Gram negative bacteria. The common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were Strep. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinatobacter lowfii, Staph. aureus, Pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. All the Gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin.

Autopsy is a powerful tool for analyzing the cause of a patient's death, progression of the disease, and the therapeutic response. However, it is frequently limited to the identification of bacterial strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis during the agonal phase of pneumonia, intrapulmonary sputum was harvested by directly inserting a swab into a resected lung, and the bacterial composition was analyzed using both pathological and microbiological techniques from 15 patients with hematological malignancies, and the results were compared with those from 25 patients with other medical and surgical diseases. Among the 54 bacteria strains isolated from the 40 patients, multidrug-resistant strains were significantly more prevalent in hematological group than in other diseases (16/21 versus 11/33, P = .002). Enterococcus faecium was preferentially isolated from the hematological patients, whereas the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was predominantly found in the nonhematological group. Two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in hematological diseases may be diagnosed as causative bacteria of pneumonia by both bacterial and pathological techniques. Although the results of this study may not be directly applicable for clinical diagnosis, this approach has a potential to become not only a diagnostic method for bacterial pneumonia, but may be also useful for the analysis of multidrug-resistant pathogens."

She had been under home intravenous hyperalimentation therapy through a totally implantable central venous catheter for 2 years because of post-radiation enteritis. Clinical examination on admission revealed severe renal insufficiency complicated with hypocomplementemia, marked proteinuria and hematuria. Chest roentgenography demonstrated moderate pulmonary congestion. Hemodialysis was initiated and her pulmonary congestion improved. On the 14th and 21st hospital day, blood culture revealed Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization. Cefazolin was administered and C-reactive protein decreased, however, renal insufficiency and hypocomplementemia did not improve. To investigate the genesis of renal insufficiency, renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopic findings of the kidney revealed severe crescentic glomerulonephritis complicated with moderate tubulointerstitial damage. Immunofluorescence-microscopic findings of the kidney revealed positive IgG, IgM, C3 deposition along the capillary lumen. From these laboratory findings and the clinical course, we diagnosed her renal disease as crescentic glomerulonephritis induced by catheter-related bloodstream infection, and the central venous catheter was removed. After removal, urinary output and hypocomplementemia remarkably improved, however, unfortunately, her renal dysfunction did not improve and maintenance hemodialysis needed to be continued. Although her renal disease was not caused by ventriculo-atrial shunt but by central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection, we supposed that the pathogenesis was a closely similar entity to shunt nephritis."

METHODS: Report of a 79-year-old woman who presented with a persistent corneal epithelial defect associated with infectious keratitis that waxed and waned for 5 months despite treatment. She had been diagnosed with lung cancer and was being treated with erlotinib, a reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. RESULTS: The keratitis required a biopsy to establish the diagnosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis keratitis. The infectious keratitis was successfully treated; however, her pain and the epithelial defect persisted. She discontinued the erlotinib treatment. Within 2 weeks, the abrasion healed and had no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: This report is, to our knowledge, the first description of a nonhealing corneal erosion and infectious keratitis possibly associated with erlotinib toxicity. EGFR is expressed in basal epithelial cells across the cornea and limbal basal cells; it is considered imperative for corneal epithelial cell proliferation and wound healing. Erlotinib is mediated through inhibition of EGFR, which is a highly promising area in molecularly targeted chemotherapies. It will become increasingly important for ophthalmologists to recognize and treat side effects of chemotherapies interfering with the epithelial growth factor pathway."

We investigated the fundamental information on the characteristics of hemodialysis inpatients and nosocomial pneumonia. We surveyed 1803 hemodialysis patients admitted to our university hospital between 2001 and 2007. The mean patient age was 64.8 years and the average period of hospitalization was 28.1 days, which was considerably longer than the average stay in our hospital (14.2 days). Patients were admitted to many different departments and for various reasons. We isolated 391 microorganisms from the sputum of 120 pneumonia patients undergoing hemodialysis, including Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which were the leading three isolates. From these 120 patients, a total of 199 pathogens were identified as being responsible for the pneumonia. Multi-drug resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was found to be susceptible to a new fluoroquinolone, but is resistant to older generation quinolones. Out of the 120 patients with pneumonia, 12 out of 18 patients infected with S. maltophilia died, indicating the highest fatality rate for this pathogen. In this survey, we found that hemodialysis patients were hospitalized for long periods, and for various reasons in many departments. They suffered from nosocomial pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens, including S. maltophilia. For pneumonia due to S. maltophilia, new generation fluoroquinolones can be the treatment of choice, although S. maltophilia-related pneumonia should be treated very carefully because of its high fatality rate."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the hospital records from 19 episodes (18 patients) of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease (greater than or equal to 19 years of age) who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy to obtain lower airway cultures between January 1979 and July 1987. We also recorded patients' clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic characteristics. RESULTS: Pneumonia was diagnosed in four of 19 episodes (21%) of acute chest syndrome based on quantitative cultures obtained at bronchoscopy. The pneumonia was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in two patients and mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the other two patients. Forty-four of 45 blood cultures were negative, and one grew Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was considered a contaminant. Chest roentgenograms revealed lower lobe involvement in 17 episodes (90%) and bilateral infiltrates in six (32%). Pleural effusions occurred in seven episodes (37%), and pleural fluid samples obtained from five of these revealed sterile exudates. CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective study suggest that bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon cause of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease. These results are consistent with previous retrospective studies using noninvasive techniques to diagnose pneumonia. Nevertheless, there appeared to be no reliable noninvasive variables that could accurately differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia and, consequently, we recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in addition to usual supportive care of these patients."

The objective was to develop a polymerase chain reaction assay for mecA using mini-bronchoalveolar lavage to allow rapid diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia attributable to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. DESIGN: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was developed using serial dilution of plasmids containing known amounts of mecA gene fragments. Specificity of molecular identification was based on the presence of the mecA gene and S. aureus-specific femA-SA gene, with absence of Staphylococcus epidermidis specific femA-SE. SETTING AND PATIENTS: To validate the polymerase chain reaction, we compared it to mini-bronchoalveolar lavage quantitative cultures in 100 mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia. We derived a threshold value for defining a positive polymerase chain reaction based on a priori criteria of 100% sensitivity. We then tested the polymerase chain reaction using this threshold value on a separate cohort of 50 patients. MAIN RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mecA down to a copy number of three, with a high degree of correlation (r=.999). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for polymerase chain reaction was 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.99). Using a cut-point of &gt;or=421 for the polymerase chain reaction resulted in sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 87% (95% confidence interval 81%-94%), positive predictive value of 39% (95% confidence interval, 29%-49%), negative predictive value of 100%, and an overall correct classification rate of 89%. Applying the polymerase chain reaction with a cut-point of &gt;or=421 to the second cohort resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of mecA combined with femA-SA and femA-SE detection was able to rapidly and accurately diagnose methicillin-resistant S. aureus."

Bacteremia/fungemia was present in 251 of 2585 cases (9.7%); the causative microorganism was gram-positive bacteria (GPB) in 122 cases (49%), gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in 90 cases (36%), fungi (F) in 31 cases (12%), and polymicrobes (P) in 8 cases (3%). Particularly prevalent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 49 cases (20%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 29 cases (12%), and Staphylococcus aureus in 25 cases (10%). With AML-87/-89, incidence of bacteremia/fungemia was 11.8% while it was 9.4% with AML-92, 8.7% with AML-95, and 9.2% with AML-97. The proportion of GPB, GNB, F, and P was 40, 41, 16, and 3% in AML-87/-89, 46, 40, 11, and 3% in AML-92, 48, 39, 11, and 2% in AML-95, and 59, 26, 11, and 4% in AML-97. The mortality rate by period was 26.5, 16.4, 14.0, and 6.8%, respectively. Pneumonia was found in 433 cases (16.8%); microbiological research covered 359 cases of AML-87/-89, AML-92, AML-97 and excluded AML-95 as there was no listing for the causative microorganism on questionnaires. Microbiologically documented pneumonia was found in 123 cases (34.3%), with GPB in 33 cases (27%), GNB in 28 cases (23%), F in 44 cases (36%), and P in 18 cases (15%); particularly prevalent were Aspergillus in 23 cases (19%), Staphylococcus aureus in 16 cases (13%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 15 cases (12%). The incidence of pneumonia overall was 24.6% with AML-87/-89, 16.9% with AML-92, 13.9% with AML-95, and 12.9% with AML-97, with a mortality rate of 28.9, 33.3, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Incidence of bacteremia/fungemia and pneumonia complicating AML has tended to decline in recent years, and mortality has also tended to improve."

Since the early postoperative period, he had manifestations of dormant infection and was with empirical antibiotics. On the index admission, his X-ray showed signs of loosening of the prosthetic components with resorption of the bone. Periprosthetic infection was managed by a two-stage surgery. First, the infected prosthesis was removed and replaced with a spacer with antibiotics. One month later, a revision prosthesis, was implanted using cement with antibiotics. Cultures of the excised tissues and materials yielded massive growth of Listeria monocytogenes and scarce growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This is the 18th published case of arthroplasty infection caused by Listeria. The presented patient most likely had dormant staphylococcal infection on which Listeria superinfection developed and accelerated the loosening. A literature review suggested several mechanisms that can make conservative management of Listeria infection difficult. They include marked stimulation of the immune system (with resulting resorption of the bone), survival in the macrophages (unavailability to antibiotics susceptible in vitro) and capability to form biofilm as well as settle in biofilms produced by other organisms. Better yield and reliability of microbiological investigations may be achieved by guided intrarticular fluid aspiration from a microincision, prolonged culture and sonification of the extracted material, two-step surgical management and follow-up intraarticular fluid aspiration prior to reimplantation of revision prosthesis."

The objective of this study is to show a step by step approach to surgical treatment and postoperative care of a meningomyelocele patient with congenital kyphosis. In meningomyelocele the incidence of kyphosis is around 12-20%. It may cause recurrent skin ulcerations, impaired sitting balance and respiratory compromise. Kyphectomy has first been described by Sharrard. This surgery is prone to complications including pseudoarthrosis, skin healing problems, recurrence of deformity and deep infections. A 15-year-old male presented with congenital kyphosis due to meningomyelocele. He had back pain, deformity and bedsores at the apex of the deformity. The wound cultures showed Staphylococcus epidermidis colonisation at the apex. He was given appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. During surgery, the apex of the deformity was exposed through a spindle-shaped incision. After instrumentation and excision of the apex, correction was carried out by cantilever technique. Two screws were inserted to the bodies of L3 and T11. After the operation, the skin was closed in a reverse cross fashion. He was sent to hyperbaric oxygen treatment for prevention of a subsequent skin infection and for rapid healing of skin flaps post operation. The patient's deformity was corrected from a preoperative Cobb angle of 135 -15  postoperative. The skin healed without any problems. Preoperative culture and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, spindle-shaped incision, reverse cross-skin closure and postoperative hyperbaric oxygen treatment can be useful adjuncts to treatment in congenital kyphosis patients with myelomeningocele to prevent postoperative wound healing and infection problems. Reduction screws and intracorporeal compression screws help to reduce the amount of screws and aid in corection of the deformity."

Bloodstream infections (BSIs), particularly, are the major cause of mortality among these patients. BSIs in OLT, are from intra-abdominal, biliary, respiratory, urinary, wound and/or central venous catheter sources. A certain percentage are of unknown origin. Using the computerized database of our microbiology laboratory, we analyzed all BSIs in 75 consecutive adult liver transplant patients in a single center between January 2008 and July 2011. BSIs occurred in 21/75 (28%) patients. Thirteen subjects had a single; two, two episodes, and the other six patients each &gt;4 episodes. All episodes occurred in the first 60 days following OLT; the majority (74%), in the first month. Among 44 microorganisms recovered, 52.3% were gram-negative, the most frequent being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 47.7% were gram-positive, the most frequent being coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis. Overall 65.9% of the isolates were resistant to several antibiotics: 40.9% displayed the multiding-resistant and 25% the panding-resistant phenotype. There was a high incidence of gram-negative and most importantly, resistant bacteria, which required appropriate therapy. These data showed that it is imperative to promote strategies to prevention and contain antimicrobial resistance."

Fifty-two positive BC were recorded in 43 patients (63% males, 37% females; mean age 65.9 +- 16.6). 72% of the patients received antibiotics before or soon after obtaining the BC, and ceftriaxone was the most frequently-prescribed antibiotic (41.93%), either alone or in combination with other antibiotics. The bacteremia was due to gram-positive cocci in 60.46% of cases, gram-negative rods in 30.23%, and gram-positive rods in 9.30%. Positive BC due to contamination were not included. The most common gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by S. aureus, while the most common gram-negative bacilli were Brucella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella sp. The suspected sources of the bacteremia were respiratory (21.2%), urinary (19.2%), or skin (19.2%). A subsequent change in the antibiotics regimen was done in 69.76% cases after BC results became available with no apparent effect on the outcome. Adding vancomycin and clindamycin was the most frequent change done (19.4% for each equally). Complications developed in 69.76% of patients, with 88.66% of them suffering from sepsis/shock. 69.23% of the patients improved and 30.77% expired; death was related to infection in 87.5% of cases. In conclusion, most bacteremia in the medical ward of the hospital were due to gram-positive cocci, which should be considered in antibiotic selection prior to BC. Risk factors for acquiring Brucellosis should always be obtained."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus epidermidisID:23227069TITLE:Quantitative PCR for Etiologic Diagnosis of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia in Intensive Care Unit.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) requires prompt and appropriate treatment. Since methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent pathogen in VAP, rapid identification of it, is pivotal. Our aim was to evaluate the utility of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as a useful method for etiologic diagnoses of MRSA pneumonia. METHODS: We performed qPCR for mecA, S. aureus-specific femA-SA, and S. epidermidis-specific femA-SE genes from bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial washing samples obtained from clinically-suspected VAP. Molecular identification of MRSA was based on the presence of the mecA and femA-SA gene, with the absence of the femA-SE gene. To compensate for the experimental and clinical conditions, we spiked an internal control in the course of DNA extraction. We estimated number of colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) of MRSA samples through a standard curve of a serially-diluted reference MRSA strain. We compared the threshold cycle (Ct) value with the microbiologic results of MRSA. RESULTS: We obtained the mecA gene standard curve, which showed the detection limit of the mecA gene to be 100 fg, which corresponds to a copy number of 30. We chose cut-off Ct values of 27.94 (equivalent to 1x10(4) CFU/mL) and 21.78 (equivalent to 1x10(5) CFU/mL). The sensitivity and specificity of our assay were 88.9% and 88.9% respectively, when compared with quantitative cultures. CONCLUSION: Our results were valuable for diagnosing and identifying pathogens involved in VAP. We believe our modified qPCR is an appropriate tool for the rapid diagnosis of clinical pathogens regarding patients in the intensive care unit."

METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years."

METHODS: A total of 43 staphylococci from respiratory tract and ocular infections were characterized for methicillin resistance using the Epsilometer test (E-test), the polymerase chain reaction for mecA gene detection and the PBP2' latex agglutination test. A perfect agreement among them was observed in 20 isolates (8 MRSA and 12 MRSE) which were then employed in the susceptibility test by using the agar disk diffusion test (NCCLS). The antibiotics tested were: netilmicin (NET), tobramycin (TOB), azithromycin (AZM), levofloxacin (LEV), moxifloxacin (MXF), chloramphenicol (C) and vancomycin (VA). RESULTS: All MRSE and most (87.5%) of MRSA isolates tested were NET and VA sensitive. The majority of MRSA were found to be resistant to all the other antibiotics, with the exception of C. In particular, 75%, 87% and 100% of the isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones (LEV and MXF), AZM and TOB, respectively. As for the MRSE group, 25% of the strains tested were resistant to C and MXF while 33%, 42% and 58% of the strains were resistant to LEV, AZM and TOB, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Together with VA, NET was the most effective antibiotic tested against both MRSA and MRSE clinical isolates. The exclusive topical use of NET for the treatment of ocular infections may curtail the emergence, spreading and persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria."

This study investigated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in endothelial and respiratory cells from newborns exposed to staphylococci. METHODS: Human vascular endothelial cells and small airway epithelial cells were incubated with neonatal blood isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 14) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14). The extracellular release of IL-8, IL-10, sICAM-1, ICAM-1 mRNA and the expression of membrane bound ICAM-1 were assessed by ELISA, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis induced higher levels of IL-8 (mean 38.5 ng/mL) and ICAM-1 mRNA (mean ratio 1.037) in the small airway epithelial cells than S. aureus (IL-8 mean 22.2 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.01 and ICAM-1 mRNA mean ratio 0.715, p &lt; 0.01). In the endothelial cells, ICAM-1 remained more integrated in the cell membranes after exposure to S. epidermidis compared with S. aureus, which induced disintegration and release of soluble ICAM-1 into the supernatants. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus epidermidis induced a higher chemoattractive response than S. aureus. A persistent transmigration of granulocytes into the lung tissue in neonatal S. epidermidis sepsis might contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated cancer patients with febrile neutropenia aged &gt;=60years with culture proven health-care associated bacteremia between January 2005 and December 2011. The date of the first positive blood culture was regarded as the date of bacteremia onset. Primary outcome was the infection related mortality, defined as the death within 14days of bacteremia onset. RESULTS: The two most common pathogens responsible for bacteremia were Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.1%) and Escherichia coli (31.5%), with high rates of methicillin resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in infection related mortality rate according to the type of malignancy (p=0.776). By the univariate analysis, factors associated with 14day mortality among febrile neutropenic episodes were prolonged neutropenia (p=0.024), persistent fever (p=0.001), hospitalization in ICU (p&lt;0.001) and the initial clinical presentations including respiratory failure (p&lt;0.001), hepatic failure (p=0.013), hematological failure (p&lt;0.001), neurological failure (p&lt;0.001), severe sepsis (p&lt;0.001), and septic shock (p=0.036).

Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC. "

We characterized this particular subgroup and analyzed the course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2011, 474 patients underwent cardiac surgery at our institution for NVE treatment. Of these, 89 patients (18.8%) suffered from MVE. Valve replacement was undertaken in 84.2% and valve repair in 15.8%. Follow-up was completed with 267 patient years. RESULTS: A delay between the onset of first symptoms and surgery of 4.7+-1.2 weeks was observed. Hence, most patients were in a critical preoperative state characterized by severe sepsis and destruction of the mitral valve. About 19.4% were emergency procedures. The MVE group presented with a higher prevalence of preoperative stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in comparison with remaining NVE cases. MVE was more likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus viridans were less frequent (P&lt;0.01 each). Early mortality (6.7%) was caused by persistent sepsis. ICU stay &gt;7 days and time on artificial ventilation &gt;40 h led to a higher risk of in-hospital death. Five-year survival was 59.6% and affected by extracardiac comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Isolated MVE was characterized by a long delay before surgery, differences in microbiological findings and a higher prevalence of preoperative strokes in comparison to NVE. Surgery for MVE can be conducted with good clinical results, but mid-term outcome is limited by extracardiac comorbidities."

The symptoms of LDIE and pocket infection were detected in 62.1 % of patients. The mean duration of LDIE symptoms prior to referral for TLE was 6.7 months. Fever and shivers were found in 55.3 % of patients, and pulmonary infections in 24.9 %. Vegetations were detected in 67.6 % of patients, and positive cultures of blood, lead, and pocket in 34.5, 46.4, and 30.0 %, respectively. The most common pathogens in all type cultures were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), with Staphylococcus epidermidis domination; the second most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus. 76.3 % of patients were treated with empirical antibiotic therapy before hospitalization due to TLE. In the laboratory tests, the mean white blood cell count was 9,671 +- 5,212/mul, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm, C-reactive protein (CRP) 46.3 mg/dl +- 61, and procalcitonin 1.57 +- 4.4 ng/ml. The multivariate analysis showed that the probability of LDIE increased with increasing CRP. The diagnosis of LDIE based on MDLC may be challenging because of a relatively low sensitivity of major criteria, which is associated with early antibiotic therapy and low usefulness of minor criteria. The important clinical symptoms of LDIE include fever with shivering and recurrent pulmonary infections. The most specific pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Laboratory tests most frequently revealed normal white blood cell count, relatively rarely elevated procalcitonin level, and significantly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP. This constellation of signs should prompt a more thorough search for LDIE."

METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished."

A possible side effect of this drug is eosinophilic pneumonia. We describe two patients with PJI treated with daptomycin who had this side effect with different clinical presentations. METHODS: Case reports and review of the literature. RESULTS: The first case was a 64-year-old male who received daptomycin as a part of the treatment for PJI caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). He developed fever without other symptoms; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed eosinophils. The second was a 61-year-old male who also used daptomycin as part of the treatment of PJI caused by MRSE and developed severe lung symptoms. Bronchoalveolar lavage and pleural fluid showed an increased number of eosinophils. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin-induced pneumonia can present with a wide range of symptoms, from fever alone to severe lung symptoms. Surgeons should be aware of this possible side effect when prescribing daptomycin."

CASE REPORT: We report a premature male newborn from a twin pregnancy with gestational age of 31(+4) weeks, birth-weight 1580g, who underwent a laparotomy because of perforation. The baby was admitted to NICU after birth with transitory respiratory failure and early onset neonatal sepsis. MS-Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood culture, gastric contents and all peripheral specimens, C-reactive protein values were elevated after birth and significantly increased before surgery; thrombocytopenia and mild anemia were found. The control blood culture showed Candida albicans. At day 25 after birth life threatening deterioration occurred: feculent vomiting, progressing distension and palpable rigidity of the abdomen, absence of peristalsis, respiratory distress. Abdominal radiograph showed significantly distension of the intestines, air liquid levels, and discrete signs of pneumoperitoneum. The baby was transferred to the surgery with the diagnosis NEC with perforation. Appendicitis acuta gangrenosa perforativa and peritonitis fibrinopurulenta totalis were found intra-operatively but without signs of NEC. Appendectomy and sanitation of the abdominal cavity were carried out. The histological result confirmed gangrenous perforative appendicitis and purulent necrotic peritonitis. The postoperative course was unremarkable. The boy was transferred to the neonatology on day 33 of life and discharged home 12 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Despite of the low incidence of neonatal appendicitis, it should be taken into consideration if unclear abdominal symptoms occur in the neonatal period. Early surgical intervention contribute to a reduction of potential complications."

LS is commonly caused by normal anaerobic flora and treated with appropriate antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. Although the incidence of disease is very rare, 15% cases of LS are fatal even in the antibiotic era because of disseminated septic thromboemboli. We reported a case of extensive bilateral LS due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in a 63-year-old female with lung adenocarcinoma. Initial examination revealed a retropharyngeal abscess; hence, intravenous ceftriaxone and steroid were initiated empirically. However, pulmonary thromboembolism developed and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis was identified in the bacterial culture. Despite intensive antibiotic and anticoagulation therapies, extensive septic thrombophlebitis involving the bilateral IJV and superior vena cava developed.

However, to our knowledge, HD catheter-related thrombosis leading to subsequent SVC syndrome, bacteremia, and pulmonary emboli has not been described. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old dialysis-dependent woman with IgA nephropathy developed facial swelling, head pressure, headache, nausea, dizziness and fever 6 weeks after right internal jugular (IJ) HD catheter placement. Chest and neck imaging demonstrated a non-occlusive thrombus surrounding the HD catheter and extending from the SVC to the junction of the right IJ and right subclavian veins, confirming thrombosis-associated SVC syndrome. Intravenous (IV) anticoagulation was initiated, as well as IV vancomycin for Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia. Despite prompt intravenous anticoagulation, 9 and 12 days after initial presentation she developed catheter-associated pulmonary embolism (PE) and PE-associated pulmonary infarction, respectively. Hypercoagulable workup was negative. The HD catheter was eventually replaced, HD resumed, and the patient was transitioned from intravenous to oral anticoagulation and discharged. Nine months later, she underwent successful renal transplantation. CONCLUSION: SVC syndrome and pulmonary embolism are potential consequences of HD catheter-related thrombosis.

VAP pathogenesis is closely linked to organisms colonizing the endotracheal tube (ETT) such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the former a common commensal with pathogenic potential and the latter a known VAP pathogen. However, recent gut microbiome studies show that pathogens rarely function alone. Hence, we determined the ETT microbial consortium co-colonizing with S. epidermidis or P. aeruginosa to understand its importance in the development of VAP and for patient prognosis. Using bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS-II sequencing on ETT biomass showing presence of P. aeruginosa and/or S. epidermidis on culture, we found that presence of P. aeruginosa correlated inversely with patient survival and with bacterial species diversity. A decision tree, using 16S rRNA and patient parameters, to predict patient survival was generated. Patients with a relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae &lt;4.6% and of Staphylococcaceae &lt;70.8% had the highest chance of survival. When Pseudomonadaceae were &gt;4.6%, age of patient &lt;66.5 years was the most important predictor of patient survival.

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of DA-HAIs, mortality and crude excess mortality at a General Hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the Republic of Cyprus for 1 year period. METHODS: A prospective cohort, active DA-HAIs surveillance study with the use of Health Acquired Infections (HAIs) ICU Protocol (v1.01 standard edition) as provided by ECDC/NHSN for the active DA-HAIs surveillance study was conducted. The study sample included 198 ICU patients admitted during the research period and hospitalized for over 48 h. The Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI), and Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) rates, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and crude excess mortality were calculated. RESULTS: CLABSI was the most frequent DA-HAI with 15.9 incidence rate per 1000 Central Venus Catheter (CVC) days. The VAP rate, was 10.1 per 1000 ventilator days and the CAUTI rate was 2.7 per 1000 urinary catheter days. Device associated infections were found to be significantly associated with the length of ICU stay (p &lt; 0.001), the CVC days (p &lt; 0.001), ventilator days (p &lt; 0.001), and urinary catheter days (p &lt; 0.001). The excess mortality was 22.1% for those who acquired a DA-HAI (95% CI, 2-42.2%) compared to the patients who remained DA-HAI free.

A second stage revision surgery was planned, after completion of the antimicrobial and antifungal treatment. The patient is followed up for 4 months without signs, symptoms or findings of infection. PJI Candida infections require a high clinical suspicion index. It is of utmost importance to report these cases, since there is no consensus yet of the proper antifungal treatment. Furthermore, a literature review regarding treatment of those cases is provided. First-line treatment with an echinocandin seems most proper, due to their fungicidal properties, their effectiveness against biofilm, as well as their minimal toxicity, making them ideal for long-term use. Further experience is needed, for better understanding the disease's pathogenesis and optimal treatment."

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2016-2017 among 239 podiatrists in Spain. The presence of MSSA, MRSA, and MRSE was determined by microbiological analysis of nasal exudate and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. Each podiatrist completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised various parameters such as sex, age, podiatry experience duration, underlying diseases, prior antibiotic treatment, hospitalization during the last year, and use of a protective mask, an aspiration system, or gloves. Results: The prevalence of MSSA, MRSA, and MRSE was 23.0%, 1.3%, and 23.8%, respectively. The MSSA prevalence was higher among podiatrists who did not use an aspiration system (32.3%) compared to those who did (19.3%; p = 0.0305), and among podiatrists with respiratory diseases (36.8%) compared to those without (20.8%; p = 0.0272). The MRSE prevalence was higher among men (33.7%) compared to women (8.6%; p = 0.0089), podiatrists aged &gt;=50 (38.5%) compared to &lt;=35 (17.8%; p = 0.0101), and podiatrists with &gt;=15 (39.3%) compared to &lt;=5 years of podiatry experience (12.5%; p = 0.0015). Among the S. aureus strains, 84.5% were resistant to penicillin, 22.4% to erythromycin, 20.7% to clindamycin, and 12.7% to mupirocin. The MRSE strains were resistant to penicillin (93.0%), erythromycin (78.9%), and mupirocin (73.7%). Conclusions: The prevalence of S. aureus and S. epidermidis nasal carriage is low among Spanish podiatrists compared to other health professionals."

This retrospective chart review study aimed to describe such information among neonatal (0 to 27 days) and pediatric (28 days to &lt;18 years) pneumonia patients in two regions of China. Methods: Electronic medical records of pneumonia hospitalizations (aged &lt;18 years) admitted between 2008 and 2013 from four hospitals under Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (Southern China) and between 2010 and 2014 at Peking University People's Hospital (Beijing, Northern China) were reviewed. Results: The average age of neonatal hospitalizations in Beijing (n=92) was 3.5 days. The mean length of hospital stay was 11.2 days, and no deaths occurred. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common bacteria found in Beijing patients, whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most common bacteria found in Guangdong patients. The average age of pediatric hospitalizations was 3.3 (+-3.1) and 6.5 (+-5.6) years in Guangdong (n=3,046) and Beijing (n=222), respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 17.4 and 5.8 days, and overall mortality rates were 0.2% and 0.5%. Conclusion: The findings revealed a low level of bacterial isolation and hence microbiological diagnoses. There was a low level of in-hospital mortality due to pneumonia, and the majority of hospitalizations were discharged from hospital, suggesting that current practice was generally effective. Neonatal hospitalizations were greater than pediatric hospitalizations in Beijing along with disparity in bacterial profile when compared with Guangdong, intending a need to improve neonatal pneumonia prophylaxis and selection of appropriate treatment."

We report a case of acute multi-organ failure occurring after a medication error with re-exposure to rifampicin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year old patient developed acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute renal failure, acute liver failure and haemolytic anemia within hours after a second re-exposure to Rifampicin for the treatment of a hip prosthesis infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis. A recent rifampicin exposure 1 week earlier had resulted in a massive rise of CRP levels without organ manifestations. Nine years previously, the patient had developed a multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction 8 days after commencing treatment with rifampicin for pulmonary tuberculosis; and 23 years previously he had received rifampicin without problems. The organ-specific hypersensitivity reactions were largely reversible after withdrawal of rifampicin and treatment with steroids. A review of the literature and summary of WHO spontaneous safety reports is also given. CONCLUSIONS: Re-exposure to rifampicin in sensitised individuals may cause acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. Due to its indications in the management of mycobacterial and implant-associated infections, rifampicin is a drug which might be given decades apart, which poses a risk that information about previous intolerance is lost."

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic microbes associated with NS at a tertiary children's hospital in Shanghai, China.Episodes of blood culture-proven sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2013 to August 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Collected data included demographics, perinatal risk factors, clinical symptoms, laboratory values, microbiology results and their antimicrobial susceptibility. Data for early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) were compared.The 341 of 976 culture-positive cases were selected, including 161 EONS cases (47.21% of 341) and 180 LONS cases (52.79% of 341). 635 incomplete cases were excluded. There was significant difference in risk factors between the EONS group and LONS group including birth weight, gestational age, 1-minute Apgar score, respiratory support, and the use of peripherally insertion central catheter (PICC). Clinical symptoms such as fever, feeding intolerance, abdominal distension, and neonatal jaundice, and laboratory results such as hemoglobin and lymphocyte counts also showed between-group differences. Staphylococcus epidermidis (22.87%), Escherichia coli (9.68%), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (9.38%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.09%) remain the principal organisms responsible for neonatal sepsis. Most isolates of Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, minocycline and tigecycline, of which more than 90% were resistant to penicillin. Most isolates of Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to amikacin and imipenem and resistant to ampicillin. Fungus was sensitive to antifungal agents. Better medical decisions, especially early detection and appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy can be made after understanding the different clinical features and pathogens of EONS and LONS."

However, its broad spectrum of action and excellent safety profile have renewed interest in this antibiotic, especially for treating infections by multidrug-resistant bacteria. The main indication for fosfomycin in pediatrics is currently community-acquired lower urinary tract infection. Given its good activity against bacteria, fosfomycin can also be useful in urinary infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria. Fosfomycin presents very good dissemination to tissues including bone and is therefore an option in the combined therapy of osteomyelitis, especially in cases produced by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or in cases with beta-lactam allergies. Fosfomycin can also be employed in combination for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia (especially carbapenemase-producing enterobacteria), S. aureus (if there is a high suspicion of MRSA or complicated infections) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. Other infections in which fosfomycin could be part of a combined therapy include staphylococcal endocarditis (in case of beta-lactam allergy or MRSA), central nervous system infections (mainly by MRSA, S. epidermidis, Listeria and resistant pneumococcus), nosocomial pneumonia and infections associated with mechanical ventilation."

METHODS: Specimens of sputum, urine, blood, secretions and puncture fluid were collected from patients admitted to the Harrison International Peace Hospital from November 2013 to November 2018. The origin of specimens, the distribution of departments and the distribution of pathogenic bacteria isolated were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 61 286 specimens were sent for examination during the 5 years. The top 5 specimens were sputum culture (n = 18 302, 29.9%), sputum smear (n = 11 253, 18.4%), blood culture (n = 9 713, 15.8%), urine culture (n = 6 448, 10.5%) and secretion culture (n = 6 133, 10.0%), accounting for 84.6% (51 849/61 286). Sputum specimens accounted for 48.2% (29 555/61 286) with the largest proportion. The number of specimens from medical wards was much higher than that from surgical wards (specimens: 25 468 vs. 10 521), respiratory medicine, department of critical care medicine and emergency intensive care unit (EICU) were important sources of pathogenic specimens in the hospital, accounting for 29.8% (18 243/61 286) in total. The average positive rate of all specimens was 23.5% (14 424/61 286). The positive rates of sputum culture and urine culture were 29.7% (5 428/18 302) and 35.4% (2 281/6 448), respectively, while the positive rate of blood culture was only 6.6% (643/9 713). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen in all specimens except for sputum culture and fecal culture. Escherichia coli [40.6% (926/2 281)], Klebsiella pneumoniae [9.2% (210/2 281)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [8.2% (188/2 281)], Enterococcus faecalis (group D) [6.6% (151/2 281)] and Candida albicans [3.2% (73/2 281)] were the most common pathogens in urine culture.

This study addressed the pro-inflammatory capacity of different S. epidermidis strains on human alveolar epithelial cells. METHODS: A549 cell monolayers were stimulated by live bacteria of S. epidermidis RP62A strain (biofilm-positive) and ATCC 12228 strain (biofilm-negative) at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 10 for 24 h. LPS (100 ng/ml) and Pam3CSK4 (1 microg/ml) were used for comparisons. Cell viability was measured by MTT method. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 were assessed using RT-PCR, immunoassays and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Both S. epidermidis strains induced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, but not IL-10. The stimulatory effect of RP62A exceeded that of LPS (p &lt; 0.05). RP62A strain showed a trend towards higher induction of pro-inflammatory mediators than ATCC 12228 strain. The co-stimulation with RP62A strain decreased cell viability compared to control and TLR agonists (p &lt; 0.05). RP62A but not ATCC 12228 stimulated mRNA and protein expression of TLR2. CONCLUSIONS: S. epidermidis drives pro-inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells in vitro. The pro-inflammatory capacity of S. epidermidis may differ between strains. Biofilm-positive S. epidermidis strain seems to induce more potent pulmonary pro-inflammation than biofilm-negative S. epidermidis strain."

Although the B symptoms with generalized lymphadenopathy are the most frequent manifestations of AITL, its diagnosis remains a challenge as clinical manifestations and pathological features are frequently misleading. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report herein the case of a 70-year-old man with intermittent fever, pulmonary infection, and skin rash developed for 1 month before admission. Previously, he had undergone thyroidectomy for thyroid papillary carcinoma. Fever occurred on the day of discharge and occurred again during the next month. Symptoms worsened despite treatment with antibiotics and papular rash appeared. The local hospital diagnosed it as drug fever and stopped all antibiotics. Fever and rash were controlled temporarily; however, both relapsed 2 days before admission. On the night of admission, the patient developed fever again. Blood culture showed Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus infection. INTERVENTIONS: Taking into account the recent history of surgery, the patient was diagnosed with septicemia and was treated with anti-infective treatment. On 13th day after admission, the patient developed fever again accompanied by generalized lymphadenopathy. However, multiple blood cultures were negative and bone marrow aspiration cytology, biopsy, immunohistochemistry, and gene rearrangement results were normal. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was finally subjected to cervical lymph node biopsy and was diagnosed with AITL. OUTCOMES: The patient was transferred to the Department of Hematology for further treatment. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the complex diagnostic challenges of AITL. AITL accompanied by thyroid carcinoma may not be a mere coincidence and administration of antibiotics may be a rare cause of AITL."

PURPOSE: The present study aimed to decipher the prevalence of group B Streptococcus (GBS)-associated sepsis, coinfections, and antibiotic susceptibility of isolated microbes in neonates. METHODS: Blood samples of 100 cases of neonatal sepsis were subcultured on blood agar, GBS agar, and MacConkey agar for isolation of GBS and suspected microbes. RESULTS: Of 100 neonatal blood samples, 85 blood samples were culture-positive, including mixed culture growth (n = 18), 25 samples as early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and 60 as late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS). Staphylococcus aureus showed high percent positivity (31.4%), followed by Candida sp (16.5%), GBS (14.1%), Klebsiella (14.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.8%), Pseudomonas (9.4%), Acinetobacter (9.4%), Esherichia coli (8.2%), and Enterococcus (5.9%). GBS was isolated more frequently from EONS than from LONS with 50% coinfections. Mode of delivery, gender, and respiratory distress in neonates were significantly associated with culture-positive sepsis. GBS isolates were highly (91.7%) susceptible to vancomycin, cefotaxime, and chloramphenicol, followed by penicillin (83.3%), ampicillin, and tetracycline (75%). GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings evidenced GBS-associated risk factors and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of neonatal sepsis, which will help clinicians in management, control, and treatment of neonatal sepsis. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The epidemiological evidence of GBS-associated neonatal sepsis, demographic characteristics, risk factor data analysis, and drug resistance pattern has disease prevention implications in neonates in low-income countries including Pakistan."

Pacemaker related infections are rare and life-threatening with incidence from 0.06% to 7% and high mortality rate (30-35%). Diagnosis is hard, frequently delayed and could be even missed due to poor clinical findings. The average delay in diagnosis is 5.5 month. We report a case of the late-onset of pacemaker lead endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis successfully treated with open heart surgery. CASE REPORT: Patient with persistent high fever for 11 month and suspicion for infective endocarditis was admitted in Cardiovascular Institute. No clinical signs of endocarditis were observed. TTE revealed large vegetation 30 x 17 mm attached to the atrial electrodes with high embolic potential. This finding was verified by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), although CT scan did not reveal vegetation. Blood cultures were negative. A sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass was performed and electrodes were extracted with large vegetation. Intraoperative finding revealed large thrombus with vegetation around pacemaker leads. Cultures of the electrodes and vegetation revealed Staphylococcus epidermidis. Surgery was followed up with antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks. He has been followed up for the next 2 years, and without complications. CONCLUSION: The absence of criteria for endocarditis and negative blood cultures should not keep the physician from ruling out lead endocarditis. This complication carries high risk of mortality if left untreated."

In this study, we set out to verify the frequency, usefulness, and costs of blood cultures in RSV infections. We addressed the issue by reviewing medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days-121 months, who were hospitalized during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57 patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10 cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1; Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1; Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to $1980. If performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached $5490. In conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection, with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus, blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children hospitalized due to RSV infection."

During a two-month study period, 154 (mean age: 75.2 ++ 12.2 years; 94 males) out of 620 (24.8%) hospitalized patients underwent 174 blood cultures and were enrolled in the study. The rate of true-positive cultures was 11.5% (20/174) and the rate of false-positive (contaminants) was 5.7% (10/174). A total of 23 microorganisms (5 multidrug resistant strains), most frequently Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), were isolated. The positivity rate was significantly higher in patients with urinary tract infection (31%) and abdomen infection (26.1%) than in patients with pneumonia (4.9%; p<0.01). Although the positivity rate in patients exposed to antibiotics was lower than in those not exposed, the difference was not statistically significant. Therapy changes due to blood culture positivity were observed in 7.1% of the patients overall. In-hospital death was observed in nine of the 136 patients with negative blood cultures (6.6%) and in none of the 18 patients with positive blood cultures. These results indicate that the yield and clinical impact of blood cultures is quite low in patients admitted to an Internal Medicine ward and suggest the need to improve the adequacy of the indications to perform the test."

Although current antiretroviral regimens are very effective in inhibiting viral replication, its elimination is not a viable goal of treatment. Despite cART, non-AIDS-defining bacterial infections are still a serious problem. The spectrum of these infections, and in particular the proportion of particular bacterial pathogens, is not sufficiently described in the scientific literature. METHODS: In the study, HIV-infected patients followed at the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw were registered in the clinic from 1 January 2007 to 31 July 2016. Survival analysis included 558 patients who met the study criteria. RESULTS: Among 251 (44.9%) of those with positive culture, the most common bacterial pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (33%) and Escherichia coli (11.1%). The most common bacteria in the upper respiratory tract was Staphylococcus aureus (26.6%). In urine cultures the most common bacteria was Escherichia coli (9.5%). Staphylococcus aureus (2.3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.3%) were the most common bacterial cultures in the wound. In skin cultures the most common bacteria was Staphylococcus aureus (3.9%).

The prevalent microorganisms and antibiotic susceptibility were investigated among LRTI patients from the pediatric ward, adult respiratory ward, and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) in order to achieve more efficient treatment protocols and better recovery. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study (January 2016 to December 2019), 4,161 positive culture samples out of 18,798 different specimens (9,645 respiratory tract samples and 9,153 blood samples) from LRTI patients were analyzed for pathogen incidence and antibiotic sensitivity. Results: Among the respiratory tract cultures, the frequency of Gram-negative bacterial strains was higher than Gram-positive bacterial strains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the dominant pathogen in both the adult respiratory ward (n = 156, 21.49%) and RICU (n = 975, 35.67%), whereas Staphylococcus aureus (n = 66, 19.19%) was the most common bacterium in the pediatric ward. Among the blood cultures, Gram-positive bacteria remained the major microorganisms involved in LRTIs, and the most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 59, 47.20%) in the pediatric ward and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10, 21.8%) in adult respiratory ward. However, Gram-negative bacteria were the main pathogens in the RICU, of which Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 51, 27.57%) is the most prevalent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa of LRTI patients remained highly susceptible (>70%) to routine antibiotics in pediatric ward. However, it only had high susceptibility to amikacin, tobramycin, gentamicin in both the adult respiratory ward and RICU and its antibiotic sensitivity to meropenem and imipenem was moderate in the adult respiratory ward and mild (<30%) in the RICU. Staphylococcus aureus isolated from LRTI patients was highly susceptible to linezolid, daptomycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, tigecycline, rifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in all three wards, moderately susceptible to gentamicin in both the adult respiratory ward and RICU and to clindamycin, oxacillin, moxifloxacin only in the adult respiratory ward. Conclusions: Microbial distribution and their patterns of antibiotic susceptibility revealed a high divergence among LRTI patients admitted to different wards in this hospital.

The result of logistic regression analysis showed that compared with no pregnancy included hypertension, the first aid measure at birth was initial resuscitation, and the MV time <= 5 days, the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates included: their mothers with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, using of tracheal intubation and ventilator time more than 5 days. Conclusion: The incidence of VAP in neonates receiving continuous MV therapy in neonatal intensive care unit is higher. Gram-positive bacteria are the main pathogens. VAP in neonates is related to whether newborn mothers with pregnancy hypertension, MV duration and tracheal intubation."

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data, pathogen species distribution, and drug sensitivity data of bloodstream infection in neutropenic pediatric patients with hematological malignancies from the Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital from January 2014 to December 2018. Results: Total 537 episodes of bloodstream infections occurred in 427 neutropenic children with hematological malignancies; the 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 3.7%. The clinical feature of 44.7% patients with bloodstream infection was only fever, and the pathogenic bacteria were mainly enterobacteriaceae bacteria. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by oral mucosa (20.7%) , respiratory tract (20.5%) , and digestive tract (14.3%) symptoms. The distribution of pathogens in patients with different symptoms of bloodstream infection varied (chi(2)=40.561, P=0.001) . Total 550 strains of pathogens were isolated, and the top 5 bacteria were Streptococcus aureus (109 strains, 19.8%) , Escherichia coli (99 strains, 18.0%) , Staphylococcus epidermidis (75 strains, 13.6%) , Klebsiella pneumoniae (67 strains, 12.2%) , and Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains, 5.8%) . The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems were <5%. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Staphylococcus aureus was 9.7%. Conclusion: The proportion of pathogenic bacteria gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli in the bloodstream infection of neutropenic children with hematological malignancies was approximately the same, suggesting that the use of antimicrobial agents should be broad-spectrum. Carbapenems, glycopeptides, and enzyme inhibitor complexes still have good effects."

Fourteen infants had pneumonia and 10 had central line-associated bacteremia. Twenty-four of 29 (83%) had invasion of the mucocutaneous barrier at the time the positive blood culture was drawn. Clinical signs and symptoms were nonspecific. Apnea/bradycardia was the most prevalent clinical feature, occurring in 20 (69%) infants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent blood culture isolate, occurring in 21 (72%) cases. Slime production by C-S blood culture isolates occurred in 23 (79%) cases. There was no prevalent antibiotic resistance pattern, phage type or plasmid profile among blood culture isolates from infants with bacteremia. Mucocutaneous isolates of C-S from infants with bacteremia were compared with those from infants without invasive disease. Infants with bacteremia had a significantly higher percentage of slime-producing organisms (75% vs. 58%, P = 0.027) and a significantly higher percentage of S. epidermidis species (79% vs. 53%, P = 0.001) than isolates from infants without bacteremia. Our data support the relationship of slime production and the S. epidermidis species of C-S as virulence factors in infants with foreign bodies. Testing C-S for slime production is a relatively simple laboratory procedure which may be an additional aid in the evaluation of their clinical significance."

The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels.

The isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to third-generation cephem antibiotics. These organisms proved to be widely distributed in hospitals and were frequently isolated from the sputum, excised lung and cardiac blood. The colonization of the sputum by bacteria in respiratory tract infections before, during and after treatment with third-generation cephem antibiotics revealed a tendency for these organisms to appear after treatment. Among the gram-positive cocci, S. faecium was most resistant to these antibiotics, followed by S. faecalis, S. epidermidis and S. aureus in that order. The incidence of resistant isolates in 1984 exceeded that in 1983, suggesting an annual increase in resistant bacteria."

Overall, the success rate was 83% and drug-related adverse effects were minimal. The drug was less efficacious in infections caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens than it was in those caused by gram-negative pathogens. The following gram-positive organisms were associated with special problems during moxalactam therapy: Streptococcus pneumoniae (development of meningitis and a relapse of pneumonia with a more resistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (in vivo emergence of moxalactam resistance, and the enterococci (failure of therapy and a fatal superinfection. Moxalactam performed well in infections caused by most gram-negative organisms, including aminoglycoside-resistant strains, but the previously reported emergence of gram-negative bacillary resistance to moxalactam during therapy was reconfirmed in our series with Serratia marcescens. The use of moxalactam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis was further supported by a patient with meningitis-ventriculitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis who was cured with moxalactam after failure on chloramphenicol."

Most of the responsible micro-organisms were multiresistant, but were initially sensitive to ceftazidime. They included 16 Pseudomonas spp., 10 Serratia spp., 6 Klebsiella spp., 7 other Enterobacteriaceae, 3 Staphylococcus spp., 3 strict anaerobes and 1 Acinetobacter anitratus. Indications for ceftazidime encompassed a broad spectrum of diseases: 10 complicated UTI, 13 skeletal and soft tissue infections, 4 bronchopulmonary infections, 6 intra-abdominal infections, 3 septicaemias, 1 brain abscess with meningitis. Ceftazidime was administered without other antimicrobials, except for metronidazole in two patients with intra-abdominal abscesses. Doses varied from 2 to 12 g/day (median: 3 g), given for 3-31 days (median: 12 days). Clinical cure was recorded in 26 patients (81%), 24 (75%) having also a bacteriological cure. In six patients, clinical findings subsided significantly but with incomplete resolution or relapse during follow-up. Four organisms developed resistance during therapy: 2 Pseudomonas, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Bacteroides vulgatus. Three patients developed mild superinfections (2 Candida, 1 Staph. epidermidis). Ceftazidime was well tolerated; adverse events were mild and reversible. Local thrombophlebitis was observed twice, two patients had a positive reaction to the direct Coombs' test, two had transitory elevation of transaminases and one suffered from drowsiness during intravenous injections. Ceftazidime appeared to be a valuable weapon for fighting severe infections in compromised patients, especially when Gram-negative bacilli were involved."

The antibiotic was administered orally in a single dose of 500 mg once a day for 7 days. The treatment efficacy was estimated by the clinical results and laboratory findings. The sputum specimens were investigated bacteriologically with testing the microflora for the drug susceptibility by using the diffusion disks. 50 per cent of the patients with AB isolated Streptococcus viridans with low (the diameter of the growth inhibition zones &lt; 16 mm) and intermediate (16-17 mm) susceptibility to the antibiotic, 33.3 per cent of the patients isolated highly susceptible (19 mm) strains of Str. pneumonia and 16.7 per cent of the patients isolated resistant (15 mm) strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Highly susceptible (17-19 mm) strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Str. viridans were isolated respectively from 55.5 and 45.5 per cent of the patients with ECB. In 4 patients with ECB a clinical improvement of the state was recorded. In the other patients with AB and ECB the recovery was stated. The bacteriological tests revealed a new pathogen in 2 patients with ECB and the failure of the treatment in another 2 patients with ECB. In all the other patients the pathogen was shown to be eradicated. In the patients isolating the new pathogen the symptomatic recovery was stated in the posttherapeutic period. Therefore, diritromycin proved to be efficient in 13 out of the 15 patients with lower respiratory tract infections. It should be noted that the drug tolerance was excellent.

METHODS: From January 1990 through March 1996, 32 patients diagnosed with complicated prosthetic valve endocarditis underwent allograft root replacement. Mean age was 58.3 +/- 13.2 years; 23 patients were men. Mean preoperative New York Heart Association functional class was 3.4. Staphylococcus epidermidis (50%) and Enterococcus faecalis (19%) were the predominant causative microorganisms. Annular abscesses were found in 26 patients (81%), aortic-mitral discontinuity in 14 patients (43%), and left ventricular-aortic discontinuity in 11 patients (34%). A cryopreserved allograft was used in 31 patients (97%) and a fresh antibiotic-treated allograft was used in 1 patient (3%). Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 150 +/- 29 minutes. Mean duration of the postoperative antibiotic treatment was 38.5 +/- 11.8 days. RESULTS: There were three operative deaths (9.4%); causes of death were multiorgan failure in 2 patients (6.2%) and low cardiac output in 1 patient (3.2%). Six patients (18%) had complete heart block (4 patients already before the operation), 3 patients (9.4%) had temporary respiratory insufficiency, and 1 patient (3.2%) needed temporary hemodialysis. Mean follow-up was 37.4 +/- 22.4 months. Two late deaths occurred: 1 patient had recurrent endocarditis, leading to a false aneurysm, and died at reoperation; another patient died of lung cancer. Actuarial 5-year survival was 87.3% (70% confidence interval, 76.8% to 97.8%); actuarial 5-year freedom from recurrent endocarditis was 96.5% (70% confidence interval, 90.0% to 100%).

Invasive procedures disrupt natural barriers to bacterial invasion, and indwelling catheters may act as conduits for infection. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics selects for the emergence of resistant pathogens. Potential sites of nosocomial gram-positive infections include the urinary tract, surgical site (including prosthetic devices), intravascular loci, lung and pleural space, facial sinuses, and peritoneal cavity. Responsible organisms include species from the genera Enterococcus and Staphylococcus. Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) emerged during the 1970s, leading to a marked increase in the use of vancomycin as the treatment of choice. Vancomycin use, in turn, has been implicated (along with widespread cephalosporin use) in the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) during the 1990s. Of great concern is the likely emergence of vancomycin-resistant staphylococci, which would constitute a public health emergency. Vancomycin remains the treatment of choice for infections caused by MRSA/MRSE, but rampant inappropriate use (e.g., prophylaxis in non-penicillin-allergic patients, treatment of methicillin-sensitive strains) must be curtailed. Chloramphenicol is increasingly the treatment of choice for serious VRE infections. Infection control policy must also minimize the possibility of transmission. All infected or colonized patients should be isolated and all environmental surfaces considered contaminated. Disposable gloves are mandatory for all patient contact, even incidental contact, and must be disposed of after each patient encounter. Hand-washing (the single most effective infection control measure) is mandatory after glove disposal. Gowns should be worn for direct contact with infected patients and masks used when aerosolization or splashing of secretions is likely."

This paper documents the recovery of MRSA from animals with respiratory, urinary tract or wound infection and from animals subjected to surgical procedures following treatment in one veterinary hospital and 16 private veterinary clinics in different geographical locations throughout Ireland. MRSA was recovered from 25 animals comprising 14 dogs, eight horses, one cat, one rabbit and a seal, and also from 10 attendant veterinary personnel. Clinical susceptibility testing suggested that the 35 isolates fell into two different groups. One group of isolates (Group 1) was resistant to one or more of the following classes of antimicrobials: macrolides, lincosamines, tetracyclines and/or fluoroquinolones. The second group (Group 2) was resistant to macrolides, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and variably resistant to fluoroquinolones, lincosamines and rifampicin. One isolate in Group 2 was susceptible to trimethoprim. Epidemiological typing by antibiogram-resistogram (AR) typing, biotyping and by chromosomal DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using SmaI digestion followed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), confirmed these two major clusters. PFGE analysis showed that most isolates from non-equine animals were indistinguishable from each other and from the isolates from personnel caring for these animals. MRSA was isolated from eight horses which attended six different veterinary practices before referral to an equine veterinary hospital. Isolates from the eight horses and from their attendant personnel had PFGE patterns that were indistinguishable and were unlike the patterns obtained from the other isolates. Comparison of PFGE patterns of isolates from veterinary sources with patterns from MRSA recovered in human hospitals showed that the most frequently occurring pattern of MRSA from non-equine animals was indistinguishable from the predominant pattern obtained from the most prevalent MRSA strain in the human population in Ireland. However, the patterns of the isolates from horses were unlike any patterns previously reported in Irish studies of human isolates. This study shows that transmission of two strains of MRSA is occurring in veterinary practices in Ireland and that one strain may have arisen from human hospitals. The source of the second strain remains to be determined."

In six cases (22%), infection was caused by unusual pathogens or pathogens of non-oropharyngeal origin, including a Mycoplasma species, Cryptococcus gattii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The overall mortality rate was 22%. Treatment was successful in 18 of 19 cases (95%) where closed thoracostomy tubes were inserted. One case resolved only after thoracotomy. Actinomyces species were isolated in three cases and in contrast to dogs where thoracotomy is recommended, they were resolved with tube thoracostomy. Mechanical complications occurred in 58% of the cats with indwelling chest tubes. Probable mechanisms of pleural space infection were identified in 18 cats (67%) including haematogenous infection (n=1), direct inoculation of bacteria into the pleural space (n=1), intrathoracic oesophageal rupture (n=1) and parapneumonic extension of infection (n=15; 56%). Of the latter, perioperative aspiration was suspected in two cats, parasitic migration in two and antecedent upper respiratory tract infection was implicated in seven. Parapneumonic spread of infection after colonisation and invasion of lung tissue by oropharyngeal flora appears to be the most frequent cause of feline anaerobic polymicrobial pyothorax and contests the widespread belief that direct inoculation of pleural cavity by bite wounds is more common."

Little is known about the pathogenicity of S. lugdunensis in companion animals. OBJECTIVES: To compare potential risk factors for infection, body sites affected, and whether cases and controls had been treated with antimicrobial drugs based upon susceptibility test results. ANIMALS: Thirty-three cases of S. lugdunensis infection (25 dogs, six cats and two small mammals) were identified between January 2003 and August 2011. Two Staphylococcus pseudintermedius controls, which were identified by the microbiology laboratory immediately before and after each S. lugdunensis case, were host-species matched to each case. METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis. RESULTS: During the period evaluated, the prevalence of S. lugdunensis infection was 1.3 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions for dogs and 0.95 cases per 10,000 admissions for cats (P = 0.453). In univariate analyses, S. pseudintermedius isolation was significantly associated with skin infections (P &lt; 0.0001), while S. lugdunensis isolation was associated with the respiratory tract (P = 0.03) and other deep tissues (P = 0.005). Cases were less likely than controls to have been treated based upon susceptibility test results (P = 0.02).

During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy."

Three weeks after starting antibiotic therapy, the patient suffered a septic pulmonary embolism. The catheter had been removed 4 weeks before the embolism. Thrombophlebitis of lower limbs, infection or thrombosis of the vascular access, and the involvement of right-sided cardiac structures were all discarded. We assumed that the pulmonary episode was probably a consequence of the paradoxical passage of embolic material, detached from the aortic valve, from arterial to venous circulation through the arteriovenous fistula."

METHODS: The glycopeptide susceptibilities of clinical isolates of staphylococci collected from 70 hospitals in 1995 were determined using NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) methods. RESULTS: In total, 2885 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 1480 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci were collected. S. aureus was significantly less susceptible to vancomycin (MIC50 1 mg/L) than teicoplanin (MIC50 0.5 mg/L), but the reverse was the case for S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis. No S. aureus isolate was resistant (&gt;/=32 mg/L) to either glycopeptide, but nine isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci had an MIC of teicoplanin of 32 mg/L. Respiratory isolates of S. aureus were less susceptible to glycopeptides than those from other sites. Staphylococci from Belgium and Italy were less susceptible to teicoplanin than isolates from other countries. CONCLUSIONS: This European survey shows that in 10 years of clinical use there have been no major changes in the susceptibility of staphylococci to the glycopeptides."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus haemolyticusID:13744TITLE:[Resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].ABSTRACT:The present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. Schematically it can outlined as follows. Streptococcus B-haemolyticus as well as Pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. Streptococcus viridans, Enterococcus and H. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. Due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci is now resistant to penicillin. In addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. The resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. The introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. However, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. On the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. Incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. Emergence of Pseudomonas, Proteus, Serratia, Providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to antibiotics. Carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field."

METHOD: Retrospectively study 41 documented post-transplant TB cases out of the 2333 patients who received kidney transplantation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between Jan. 1991 and Apr. 2007. RESULTS: TB in the post-renal-transplant population in Southern China displayed the following characteristics: (i) high incidence within a short time after transplantation, the median interval between renal transplantation and diagnosis of TB was 8 months (range: 1-156 months) and 56.1% were diagnosed within the first year post-transplant; (ii) high prevalence (51.2%) of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis; (iii) high co-infection rate (19.5%), pathogens included candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter haemolyticus and cytomegalovirus; (iv) fever (82.9%), cough (56.1%) and sputum (39.0%) are the most common clinical manifestations; (v) purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) skin test had little diagnostic value in this group with a negative result in all 41 cases; (vi) acute rejection (29.3%) and liver function damage (17.1%) were the main adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy; (vii) mortality of patients with post-transplant tuberculosis reached up to 22.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese renal transplant recipients face a high risk of TB because of their immuno-compromised state and epidemiological prevalence of the disease. Therefore, attention should be given to this differential diagnosis in clinical practice.

Apropos a case of disseminated Fusarium oxysporum sepsis.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Catheter-related sepsis is the most frequent complication in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for short bowel syndrome (SBS). A low-grade systemic inflammatory state and an altered mucosal immune response, as well as diminished intestinal barrier function have been characterized in these patients. The possibility of systemic immunocompromise has only recently been suggested. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old female with traumatic SBS was admitted for possible catheter-related sepsis. She was asplenic and had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as a result of a pancreatic resection. A large skin ulceration was present on her left calf, which appeared unusual for a disseminated bacterial infection. Chest x-ray and computed tomography scan revealed multiple subpleural pulmonary infiltrates consistent with bacterial or fungal dissemination. Blood cultures from the port system and from the peripheral blood grew Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Fusarium oxysporum. The port system was removed, and flucloxacillin and voriconazole were given for 33 and 35 days, respectively. Clinical signs of disseminated sepsis resolved slowly. Bone marrow biopsy ruled out primary hematologic disease. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Catheter-related sepsis in patients on HPN is usually caused by Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria or by Candida species. Identification of molds in blood cultures strongly suggests Fusarium species, which should be treated appropriately with voriconazole or amphotericin B. (2) HPN and SBS aggravated by asplenism and diabetes mellitus can cause severe immunocompromise. (3) Fusaria have a strong tendency to persist or reappear after bone marrow transplantation, which is therefore relatively contraindicated in these patients."

His general condition was good except for pyrexia. The left lobe of the thyroid gland was swollen, red, hot, and tender, and neck movement was limited. The provisional diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. We demonstrated the existence of an orifice of the left piriform sinus by esophagography in this case, and made a diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by a piriform sinus fistula in the hypopharynx. The causative organisms of acute suppurative thyroiditis include Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and alpha-streptococcus, but the organisms responsible are commonly undetectable in clinical cases. We detected Eikenella corrodens in the present patient. Although Eikenella species occasionally causes acute suppurative thyroiditis in adults, it is rare for this to happen in pediatric patients. Antibiotics were administered for 7 days. We also performed aspiration of the abscess on the 8th day of the illness. The abscess was reduced in size and tenderness was relieved after aspiration. In conclusion, if a pediatric patient has swelling, heat, tenderness, and redness of the anterior neck, we should keep in mind acute suppurative thyroiditis and the possibility of a fistula. If there is an abscess, we should immediately perform aspiration, culture, and isolation, and choose the appropriate antibiotics for the causative bacteria."

One month prior, he had been admitted with similar symptoms. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) had shown a PVS and no valve vegetations were observed. Following discharge, he was readmitted with fever and blood cultures positive for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. A new TTE revealed two pulmonary valve vegetations and a previously undetected ostium secundum-type atrial septal defect (ASD), confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography. The clinical course was uneventful with intravenous antibiotic treatment and the patient was safely discharged. This is a case of pulmonary valve infective endocarditis (IE). The incidence of right-sided IE is on the rise due to the increased number of patients using central venous lines, pacing, haemodialysis and other intravascular devices. Pulmonary valve IE is extremely rare, especially in structurally normal hearts. The case reported here, presents a combination of predisposing factors, such as severe congenital PVS, the presence of a central venous catheter, and haemodialysis. The fact that it was an older patient with severe congenital PVS and associated with a previously undiagnosed ASD, is also an unusual feature of this case, making it even more interesting."

METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy."

PTTB occurs most frequently within the first years after transplantation, manifesting as pulmonary or disseminated TB. Gastrointestinal TB (GITB) is a rare and potentially lethal manifestation of PTTB and may show delayed onset in renal transplant recipients due to the use of lower doses of immunosuppressants. Further, non-specificity of symptoms and the common occurrence of GI disorders in transplant recipients may delay diagnosis of GITB. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare survival case of isolated GITB in a renal transplant recipient, occurring seven years after transplantation. The patient's condition was complicated by severe sepsis with positive blood culture Staphylococcus haemolyticus, septic shock, multiple organ failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor circulatory support and intermittent hemodialysis. Furthermore, nosocomial infections such as invasive aspergillosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred during hospitalization. Antituberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) was initiated upon Mycobacterium confirmation. Moreover, treatment with voriconazole due to the Aspergillus flavus and meropenem due to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was initiated, the former necessitating discontinuation of rifampicin. After 34 days, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and was discharged to the pulmonary ward, followed by complete recovery. CONCLUSION: This case offers a guideline for the clinical management towards survival of GITB in transplant patients, complicated by septic shock and multiple organ failure, including acute renal injury and ARDS."

Late Presenters, Very Late Presenters and AIDS presenters still represent, also in Europe, including Italy, a huge challenge in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male with a history of fever and back pain. HIV test resulted positive with a high HIV Viral Load and a very low T-CD4 number of cells (5 cells/mm3).

Although the B symptoms with generalized lymphadenopathy are the most frequent manifestations of AITL, its diagnosis remains a challenge as clinical manifestations and pathological features are frequently misleading. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report herein the case of a 70-year-old man with intermittent fever, pulmonary infection, and skin rash developed for 1 month before admission. Previously, he had undergone thyroidectomy for thyroid papillary carcinoma. Fever occurred on the day of discharge and occurred again during the next month. Symptoms worsened despite treatment with antibiotics and papular rash appeared. The local hospital diagnosed it as drug fever and stopped all antibiotics. Fever and rash were controlled temporarily; however, both relapsed 2 days before admission. On the night of admission, the patient developed fever again. Blood culture showed Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus infection. INTERVENTIONS: Taking into account the recent history of surgery, the patient was diagnosed with septicemia and was treated with anti-infective treatment. On 13th day after admission, the patient developed fever again accompanied by generalized lymphadenopathy. However, multiple blood cultures were negative and bone marrow aspiration cytology, biopsy, immunohistochemistry, and gene rearrangement results were normal. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was finally subjected to cervical lymph node biopsy and was diagnosed with AITL. OUTCOMES: The patient was transferred to the Department of Hematology for further treatment. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the complex diagnostic challenges of AITL. AITL accompanied by thyroid carcinoma may not be a mere coincidence and administration of antibiotics may be a rare cause of AITL."

We addressed the issue by reviewing medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days-121 months, who were hospitalized during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57 patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10 cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1; Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1; Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to $1980. If performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached $5490. In conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection, with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus, blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children hospitalized due to RSV infection."

A study of 24 cases in 4,498 operations.ABSTRACT:The incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis in a series of 4,498 consecutive cataract operations, performed in a period of 10 years, was examined and found to equal 0.533%. Paracentesis of the anterior chamber was done in two cases and revealed Staphylococcus albus to be the causative organism in both instances. Conjunctival cultures were recovered in a further 17 cases, and showed S. albus in pure culture in eight cases and in combination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteous morgani in two cases. Streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in pure culture in one case, while the cultures from six other patients were negative. The role of such factors as age, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, ""weak ocular tissue"", and persurgical complications which predisposed to postoperative infections was examined and found to have no significance on the occurrence of endophthalmitis in the present study. The visual end results were assessed and showed a better prognosis than generally expected. Of 24 cases, five achieved good visual acuity (6/6-6/12), 13 had a useful vision (6/18-6/60), while five remained actually blind (less than 6/60). In only one case was the eye enucleated. Methods of treatment and prophylaxis are described and discussed. A total suppression or elimination of all regional bacteria at the time of surgery seems to be the logical goal."

Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 &lt; or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated &gt; or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken."

Five hundred and thirty one samples of pharingeal swabs were obtained from children with ARI. 74% were younger than one year old. Brochopneumonias constituted 66.39% of the cases. In total 357 agents were isolated 35% corresponding to bacteria in pure culture, 23.3% to mixed infections and 11.6% only viruses. The bacteria were: Haemphilus influenza (12.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Staphylococcus aureus (9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was identified in 5 children and M. hominis in 3. Adenoviruses were isolated in 98 patients, parainfluenza in 19, respiratory syncytial virus in 4, influenza in 1 and picornavirus in 2. Predominating socioeconomic factors were: overcrowding, deficient schooling and low income of parents which favor malnutrition. The more frequent agents were constitutes by bacteria. Viruses were a less cause of infection. It was confirmed that babies under 12 months are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia and prompt treatment with antimicrobial agents lowered the lethality. Low socioeconomic level is a possible predisposing factor for respiratory diseases."

We report a 4-year old girl with congenital heart disease, who suffered from 2 IE episodes secondary to Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly Haemophilus aphrophilus) and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, both rarely reported pathogens in this age group. The patient was initially successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses, however removal of the Contegra valved conduit during the second episode was required due to recurrence of fever and development of pulmonary embolism despite completion of antibiotic therapy. A. aphrohilus is a member of the fastidious gram negative microorganisms of the HACEK group (Haemophilus spp., Aggregatibacter spp, Cardiobaterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella kingae), that colonize the oropharynx and are a recognised cause of IE. Prognosis of children with IE due to HACEK group members varies, half of them suffering from complications and mortality rates of 10-12.5%. Although S. lugdunensis belongs to coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS), it behaves more like S. aureus species rather than CONS. This microorganism is a well-described cause of endocarditis in adult patients, associated with high requirements of surgical procedures and mortality (42-78%). In conclusion, paediatric IE can be caused by uncommon microorganisms associated with severe complications and potential fatality. The isolation of S. lugdunensis or A. aphrophilus in febrile patients should be considered clinically relevant and cardiac involvement must be ruled out. Those patients with proved IE will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses and in complicated cases surgical intervention. "

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (&gt; or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p &lt;.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus intermediusID:16735670TITLE:A case of Streptococcus intermedius empyema.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: To report a case of empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius as a complication of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CASE SUMMARY: An 85-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart failure, and hypothyroidism developed empyema as a result of 2 episodes of CAP and an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis within the past 2 months. Therapy with intravenous levofloxacin 750 mg every 48 hours was initiated. Culture results of the empyema fluid yielded pure growth of a rarely encountered microorganism, S. intermedius. Intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g every 6 hours was added to the antimicrobial therapy at that time. However, cultures continued to show S. intermedius. Surgical decortication was unsuccessful, and the patient died after a 30 day hospital stay. DISCUSSION: Early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of CAP treatment. Although rare, empyema or thoracic abscess can occur despite this therapy, due to mucosal changes caused by CAP. Historically, antimicrobial therapy used to treat organisms that typically cause CAP also has activity against S. intermedius. However, growth of this microorganism and failure to respond to therapy should alert clinicians to the possibility of empyema or abscess formation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite historical in vitro susceptibility data of S. intermedius, antimicrobial therapy may be ineffective, and more extreme measures may be needed to achieve a successful outcome. Early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy needs to remain the mainstay of the treatment of CAP in an attempt to prevent fatal complications such as this from occurring."

Haemophilus parainfluenzae is usually categorized as one of the normal flora which colonizes in the ears and the nasopharynx, and it has been long considered that H. parainfluenzae has little pathogenicity in the lower respiratory tract and lung parenchymal. In this report, we present a case of pulmonary abscess caused by both H. parainfluenzae and Streptococcus intermedius. The patient was a 75-year-old man who had had total esophageo-gastrectomy because of esophageal cancer. He presented with purulent sputum, and chest X-ray film showed a dense consolidation in the right upper lung field. CT-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration was performed as a diagnostic procedure. Since both H. parainfluenzae and S. intermedius had been isolated from the lesion, pulmonary abscess caused by these two pathogens was diagnosed. The patient was treated with panipenem/betamipron, and his symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray film improved thereafter. So far, very few cases have been reported in which H. parainfluenzae caused lower respiratory tract infection. Although S. intermedius is known as one of the pathogens of pulmonary abscess, it is possible that H. parainfluenzae could also be pathogenic in infectious diseases of the lung."

Results of a complete blood count revealed severe leukocytosis with a mature heterophilia. Computed tomography scans showed a large amount of soft-tissue attenuating material within the infraorbital sinus and associated diverticula. Aerobic culture results of the nasal discharge showed a mixed population of Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella species, including Pasteurella pneumotropica; all isolated bacteria were susceptible to enrofloxacin. Clinical signs did not resolve over the course of 9 weeks of antibiotic treatment. The macaw died after cardiopulmonary arrest while hospitalized. At necropsy, a 2 x 2 x 3-cm firm, tan, friable, space-occupying mass surrounded by a thick exudate was present in the left preorbital diverticulum of the infraorbital sinus. The cranioventral one-third of the trachea contained a 4 x 0.5-cm white-yellow plaque. On histologic examination, the sinus mass was diagnosed as a nasal adenocarcinoma, and the tracheal plaque was caused by fungal infection, most likely with an Aspergillus species."

Shared features between SIG and Staphylococcus aureus may result in the misidentification of SIG in human clinical cultures. This study examined the clinical and microbiological characteristics of isolates recovered at a tertiary-care academic medical center. From 2013 to 2015, 81 SIG isolates were recovered from 62 patients. Patients were commonly &gt;=50 years old, diabetic, and/or immunocompromised. Documentation of dog exposure in the electronic medical record was not common. Of the 81 SIG isolates, common sites of isolation included 37 (46%) isolates from wound cultures and 17 (21%) isolates from respiratory specimens. Although less common, 10 (12%) bloodstream infections were documented in 7 unique patients. The majority of SIG (65%) isolates were obtained from polymicrobial cultures. In comparison to S. aureus isolates from the same time period, significant differences were noted in proportion of SIG isolates that were susceptible to doxycycline (74% versus 97%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (65% versus 97%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001), and ciprofloxacin (78% versus 59%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). Methicillin resistance (MR) was detected in 12 (15%) of 81 SIG isolates. All MR isolates detected by an oxacillin disk diffusion test would have been misclassified as methicillin susceptible using a cefoxitin disk diffusion test. Thus, SIG is recovered from human clinical specimens, and distinction of SIG from S. aureus is critical for the accurate characterization of MR status in these isolates."

The patient presented with fever and altered mental status, but had no other localizing symptoms or signs; coagulase-negative staphylococcus (subsequently identified as S. lugdunensis) was isolated from two sets of blood cultures. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms showed a large (2.3 x 3.1 cm) vegetation on the pulmonary valve with moderate valvular insufficiency. The patient was treated with 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy and is stable 4 months following the completion of therapy; no surgical intervention was performed. Of the 28 previously reported cases of S. lugdunensis endocarditis, only 1 had previously survived with medical therapy alone. This is the 3rd case report of S. lugdunensis endocarditis in a patient on hemodialysis; the presumed portal of entry in this and previously reported cases was the vascular access device. Endocarditis due to this organism is characterized by a high mortality, rapid tissue destruction, and a predilection for native valves. Because the clinical outcome is much more favorable with valvular replacement, speciation of the organism assumes great importance in defining the therapeutic approach."

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Study at two centres (a tertiary care centre and a community hospital). PATIENTS: 10 patients with IE caused by S lugdunensis in 912 consecutive patients with IE between 1990 and 2003. METHODS: Prospective study of consecutive patients carried out by the multidisciplinary team for diagnosis and treatment of IE from the study institutions. English, French, and Spanish literature was searched by computer under the terms ""endocarditis"" and ""Staphylococcus lugdunensis"" published between 1989 and December 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, required surgery, and prognostic factors of mortality in left sided cases of IE. RESULTS: 10 cases of IE caused by S lugdunensis were identified at our institutions, representing 0.8% (four of 467), 1.5% (two of 135), and 7.8% (four of 51) of cases of native valve, prosthetic valve, and pacemaker lead endocarditis in the non-drug misusers. Native valve IE was present in four patients (two aortic, one mitral, and one pulmonary), prosthetic valve aortic IE in two patients, and pacemaker lead IE in the other four patients. All patients with left sided IE had serious complications (heart failure, periannular abscess formation, or shock) requiring surgery in 60% (three of five patients) of cases with an overall mortality rate of 80% (four of five patients). All patients with pacemaker IE underwent combined medical treatment and surgery, and mortality was 25% (one patient). In total 59 cases of IE caused by S lugdunensis were identified in a review of the literature. The combined analysis of these 69 cases showed that native valve IE (53 patients, 77%) is characterised by mitral valve involvement and frequent complications such as heart failure, abscess formation, and embolism. Surgery was needed in 51% of cases and mortality was 42%. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (nine of 60, 13%) predominated in the aortic position and was associated with abscess formation, required surgery, and high mortality (78%). Pacemaker lead IE (seven of 69, 10%) is associated with a better prognosis when antibiotic treatment is combined with surgery. CONCLUSIONS: S lugdunensis IE is an uncommon cause of IE, involving mainly native left sided valves, and it is characterised by an aggressive clinical course. Mortality in left sided native valve IE is high but the prognosis has improved in recent years. Surgery has improved survival in left sided IE and, therefore, early surgery should always be considered. Prosthetic valve S lugdunensis IE carries an ominous prognosis."

It causes life-threatening events such as rupture of cardiac valve or cerebral or pulmonary embolism due to necrosis on the endocardial tissue involved by the bacteria. Antibiotic therapy without cardiac surgery or delayed cardiac surgery usually follows a fatal course in S. lugdunensis endocarditis. In this report the first case of S. lugdunensis endocarditis from Turkey was presented. A 37-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a 2-weeks history of fever chills and accompanying intermittent pain on the left side of the thorax. Other than recurrent folliculitis continuing for 20 years, his history was unremarkable. Echocardiography revealed vegetation on the mitral valve of the patient and vancomycin plus gentamicin were initiated with the diagnosis of IE. All blood cultures (5 sets) taken on admission and within the initial 48 hours of the antibiotic therapy yielded S. lugdunensis. According to the susceptibility test results, the antibiotic therapy was switched to ampicillin-sulbactam plus rifampin. Blood cultures became negative after the third day of therapy, however, cardiac failure was emerged due to rupture of mitral valve and chorda tendiniea on the 12th day of the therapy. Cardiac surgery revealed that mitral valve and surrounding tissue of the valve were evidently necrotic and fragile, anterior leaflet of the mitral valve was covered with vegetation, posterior leaflet and chorda tendiniea were ruptured. Vegetation was removed and the destructed mitral valve was replaced with a mechanical valve. Vegetation culture remained sterile, however, antibiotics were switched to vancomycin plus rifampin due to persistent fever on the 21st day of the therapy (9th day of operation). Fever resolved four days after the antibiotic switch. Antibiotics were stopped on the 9th weeks of admission and the patient was discharged. He had no problem in follow-up controls for one year. In conclusion, proper antibiotic therapy combined with early cardiac surgery seems to be the optimal therapeutic approach in IE caused by S. lugdunensis."

We report a 4-year old girl with congenital heart disease, who suffered from 2 IE episodes secondary to Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly Haemophilus aphrophilus) and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, both rarely reported pathogens in this age group. The patient was initially successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses, however removal of the Contegra valved conduit during the second episode was required due to recurrence of fever and development of pulmonary embolism despite completion of antibiotic therapy. A. aphrohilus is a member of the fastidious gram negative microorganisms of the HACEK group (Haemophilus spp., Aggregatibacter spp, Cardiobaterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella kingae), that colonize the oropharynx and are a recognised cause of IE. Prognosis of children with IE due to HACEK group members varies, half of them suffering from complications and mortality rates of 10-12.5%. Although S. lugdunensis belongs to coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS), it behaves more like S. aureus species rather than CONS. This microorganism is a well-described cause of endocarditis in adult patients, associated with high requirements of surgical procedures and mortality (42-78%). In conclusion, paediatric IE can be caused by uncommon microorganisms associated with severe complications and potential fatality. The isolation of S. lugdunensis or A. aphrophilus in febrile patients should be considered clinically relevant and cardiac involvement must be ruled out. Those patients with proved IE will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses and in complicated cases surgical intervention. "

SUMMARY: A 48-year-old man with significant comorbidities was admitted to our institution with complaints of malaise, shortness of breath, and vague persistent pain. He was diagnosed with S. lugdunensis infective endocarditis and was treated with cefazolin continuous infusion for 10 days without resolution of bacteremia. As surgical intervention was deemed inappropriate, rifampin was added to the treatment regimen for its antibiofilm activity. After rifampin initiation, resolution of bacteremia was rapidly achieved. Subsequent blood cultures remained negative, and the patient was discharged home in stable condition to complete six weeks of i.v. cefazolin and rifampin therapy. The patient continued treatment, as documented by the infusion center, weekly for five weeks. The patient was rehospitalized during his sixth week of treatment due to impending respiratory failure, whereupon he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit.

This review article underscores the important points in the literature about S. lugdunensis infections, including its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as specific types of infections it can cause. Anatomical and age-related distributions of S. lugdunensis SSTIs have been noted, though they most commonly occur as abscesses. S. lugdunensis can also manifest as an aggressive form of IE presenting with valve destruction and abscess formation, frequently requiring surgery and with a high mortality rate. Bone and joint infections caused by S. lugdunensis are also more invasive than infections by other species of CNS. The clinical presentation of S. lugdunensis infection in SSTI, IE, and bone/joint infection is frequently more similar to that of S. aureus infection than that of other CNS infections, necessitating species-level differentiation of CNS for proper diagnosis. Though historically, this depended upon biochemical tests that were neither routine nor reliable, the implementation of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in clinical laboratories has made identification of CNS species such as S. lugdunensis more practical. Imaging modalities, especially the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET), are another important emerging trend in the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as S. lugdunensis infection. S. lugdunensis remains highly susceptible to a wide gamut of antibacterial therapies, which is uncharacteristic of other CNS. Infections can usually be treated by antibiotics traditionally used for CNS such as oxacillin. The breakpoints for S. lugdunensis are higher than those of other CNS and similar to S. aureus breakpoints. In the case of aggressive IE or bone/joint infection by S. lugdunensis, it is recommended to treat with a beta-lactam agent. Further study is needed to understand the diversity, virulence, and population structure of this species, as well as its role in other infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory infections, peritonitis, and bacteremia."

","SPECIES:Staphylococcus pseudintermediusID:27241371TITLE:Human infections due to Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, an emerging zoonosis of canine origin: report of 24 cases.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius has been recently identified as a novel species within the genus Staphylococcus, and is commonly associated with infections in dogs. Currently, there are few reports of human infections due to this bacterium. OBJECTIVE: To use a population-based approach to describe the characteristics of human S. pseudintermedius infections in a large Canadian healthcare region. METHODS: All adult cases aged &gt;=18 years identified at a large regional laboratory from April 1, 2013 to April 1, 2015 who had at least one positive culture for S. pseudintermedius were retrospectively reviewed. A combination of phenotypic methods, mass spectrometry (i.e., MALDI-TOF), and cpn60 sequencing were used to identify S. pseudintermedius. Chart review was conducted, and cases were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: Twenty-seven isolates of S. pseudintermedius from 24 human cases were included for analysis. 58.3% were male with median age of 61 years (IQR 55-70.5). Most patients [22 (92.1%)] had confirmed contact with dogs at time of infection. S. pseudintermedius was isolated in 18 cases (75.0%) of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), and 2 invasive cases (8.3%) including a prosthetic joint and bloodstream infection. The other 4 patients were considered to be colonized (skin - 3; lung - 1). Methicillin resistance was identified in 3 cases with 6 total isolates (22.2%); multi-drug resistance was also demonstrated commonly. CONCLUSION: S. pseudintermedius is most commonly associated with SSTIs in humans. Transmission probably occurs from a pet dog. Species-level identification of S. pseudintermedius is important due to the high prevalence of antibiotic resistance, particularly to methicillin."

Shared features between SIG and Staphylococcus aureus may result in the misidentification of SIG in human clinical cultures. This study examined the clinical and microbiological characteristics of isolates recovered at a tertiary-care academic medical center. From 2013 to 2015, 81 SIG isolates were recovered from 62 patients. Patients were commonly &gt;=50 years old, diabetic, and/or immunocompromised. Documentation of dog exposure in the electronic medical record was not common. Of the 81 SIG isolates, common sites of isolation included 37 (46%) isolates from wound cultures and 17 (21%) isolates from respiratory specimens. Although less common, 10 (12%) bloodstream infections were documented in 7 unique patients. The majority of SIG (65%) isolates were obtained from polymicrobial cultures. In comparison to S. aureus isolates from the same time period, significant differences were noted in proportion of SIG isolates that were susceptible to doxycycline (74% versus 97%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (65% versus 97%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001), and ciprofloxacin (78% versus 59%, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). Methicillin resistance (MR) was detected in 12 (15%) of 81 SIG isolates. All MR isolates detected by an oxacillin disk diffusion test would have been misclassified as methicillin susceptible using a cefoxitin disk diffusion test. Thus, SIG is recovered from human clinical specimens, and distinction of SIG from S. aureus is critical for the accurate characterization of MR status in these isolates."

In dogs, it is believed that bacteria from canine milk are not the primary cause of neonatal infections. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is colonizing the skin and mucocutaneous junctions in adult dogs and can act as an opportunistic pathogen. This bacterium was previously isolated from the canine milk and, although, its transmission from the dam's milk to the newborn puppies causing a neonatal sepsis was suggested, this hypothesis has not been confirmed. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4.5-year-old healthy Boston terrier dam had an elective cesarean section, delivering five normal puppies and one dead runt. Next day, two puppies developed pustules on their legs and around the muzzle. After two more days, strings of blood were noticed in the stool of the biggest puppy that suddenly died later that night. The same day, blood became visible in the feces of all other puppies. Necropsy of the dead puppy revealed a distended abdomen, catarrhal gastroenteritis with lymphadenopathy, dark red and slightly firm lung, mild dilatation of the right heart chamber and congestion of the liver, spleen, pancreas and meninges. The thoracic cavity contained white-yellow slightly opaque exudate, and there was transudate in the abdominal cavity. Histopathology revealed an acute interstitial pneumonia and multifocal myocardial necrosis with mineralization. Bacteriology of the internal organs, body cavity effusions of the dead puppy and dam's milk revealed a diffuse growth of S. pseudintermedius in pure culture. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that all isolates belonged to the sequence type 241 and differed in 2-5 single nucleotide polymorphisms; thus, the epidemiological link between the outbreak-associated isolates was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a confirmed transmission of S. pseudintermedius through dam's milk causing a neonatal sepsis in a puppy after an elective cesarean section. The epidemiological link between S. pseudintermedius isolates obtained from dam's milk and internal organs of the affected puppy was confirmed by WGS. Our findings indicate that milk of healthy dams can serve as a reservoir of bacteria that can cause fatal sepsis in the newborn puppies."

METHODS: Ciprofloxacin was evaluated along with other commonly-used antibiotics against a total of 480 clinical isolates obtained from urine samples. The samples were collected from community patients from different parts of the Gaza Strip. Susceptibility tests were done by the Kerby Bauer method. RESULTS: Among the tested drugs, the percent resistance rate to ciprofloxacin was 15.0 percent. However, high resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected among Acinetobacter haemolyticus (28.6 percent), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (25.0 percent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.0 percent), Klebsiella pneumonia (17.6 percent) and Escherichia coli (12.0 percent). Minimal inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin was measured for all resistant UTI isolates. CONCLUSION: This study indicates emerging ciprofloxacin resistance among most UTI bacterial pathogens. Increasing resistance against ciprofloxacin demands coordinated monitoring of its activity and rational use of the antibiotics."

We compared the antimicrobial potency of ulifloxacin with that of other fluoroquinolones against common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens. The microbial isolates were prospectively collected between January 2007 and May 2008 from patients with community-acquired infections in Greece. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (for respiratory isolates only), and ulifloxacin using the E-test method. The binary logarithms of the MICs [log2(MICs)] were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. A total of 409 isolates were studied. Ulifloxacin had the lowest geometric mean MIC for the 161 Escherichia coli, 59 Proteus mirabilis, and 22 Staphylococcus saprophyticus urinary isolates, the second lowest geometric mean MIC for the 38 Streptococcus pyogenes respiratory isolates (after moxifloxacin), and the third lowest geometric mean MIC for the 114 Haemophilus influenzae and the 15 Moraxella catarrhalis respiratory isolates (after ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Compared with levofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(MICs) against E. coli (p &lt; 0.001), P. mirabilis (p &lt; 0.001), S. saprophyticus (p &lt; 0.001), and S. pyogenes (p &lt; 0.001).

Of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. RESULTS: There were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. The study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas Salmonella group B was found in 5 of 41 isolates. Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. A study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of Salmonella infections. Among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants."

Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis."

DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series and literature review. PATIENTS: All patients with this condition treated at the Singapore National Eye Centre from 1994 through 2001. INTERVENTIONS: Core or complete vitrectomy and intravitreal and systemic antibiotics. METHODS: A review of the systemic and ocular characteristics and treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Visual outcome. RESULTS: Group B Streptococcus endogenous endophthalmitis developed in four patients after the onset of septic arthritis and in one patient with cervical epidural abscess after acupuncture, presenting as a diffuse endophthalmitis. Group B Streptococcus was isolated in the blood, vitreous, and joints. Despite the use of high-dose intravenous antibiotics within 72 hours of ocular presentation, intravitreal antibiotic injection, and vitrectomy (two eyes), all eyes lost light perception and became phthisical. A survey of the literature revealed that GBSEE is rare and that 17 cases have been reported since 1985. For purposes of analysis, four of these cases were excluded because of inadequate details and our five cases were included. Group B Streptococcus endogenous endophthalmitis was found to arise from hematogenous spread from cutaneous sites of infection (16.7%), pharyngitis (11.1%), and pneumonia (11.1%). Septic arthritis (38.9%) and endocarditis (33.3%) were concomitant sites of infection along with endophthalmitis. The septic arthritis typically involved multiple joints. Four patients (22.2%) had diabetes mellitus and three had other underlying predisposing illness. Although most patients received intravenous (83.3%) and intravitreal (55.6%) antibiotics and four eyes underwent therapeutic vitrectomy, useful vision was preserved in only four eyes. Two patients died of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Group B Streptococcus endogenous endophthalmitis is a devastating condition often associated with septic arthritis. The visual prognosis is poor, despite therapy."

In some instances these steps may provide immediate clues to a potentially life-threatening illness. This article presents the case of a former 26-week male infant, who presented on day of life 42, 32 weeks gestation corrected, with increased respiratory distress and an evolving lesion on the left lower cheek. The classic location and progressive erythema, warmth, induration, and tenderness in the submandibular region strongly suggested the diagnosis of group B streptococcal (GBS) cellulitis. Despite the presence of concurrent GBS septicemia, the infant had complete resolution of focal and systemic symptoms with 10 days of treatment. One month later, the infant developed pneumonia with respiratory failure, shock, culture-positive septicemia, and presumed meningitis and was again treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Diagnosis at that time was late-onset group B streptococcal infection. Serotypes were not available to aid in distinguishing between recurrent or persistent GBS versus a new occurrence of late-onset disease. A brief overview of late-onset GBS infections and their cutaneous manifestations, along with a step-by-step guide to physical examination, is provided. The differential diagnosis for facial cellulitis is reviewed with an emphasis on early recognition and treatment in light of the escalated risks for persistent or recurrent GBS infection in infants with GBS cellulitis."

Repair of the hernia was indicated and the postoperative result was excellent. The relationship between a delayed-onset diaphragmatic hernia and a group B streptococcal infection is still unknown. Increased intrathoracic pressure caused by mechanical ventilation coupled with an abnormal lung compliance due to inflammation may have resulted in the delayed herniation.

We report the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to rescue a newborn with refractory GBS sepsis and meningitis who developed cardiopulmonary failure. This 2-day-old infant weighed 2640 g and was born to a healthy mother at full term. Respiratory distress, hypotension, and persistent pulmonary hypertension developed on the second day of life. The clinical condition deteriorated rapidly despite conventional treatment, and venoarterial ECMO was established to rescue this moribund newborn. During ECMO, the patient regained stable hemodynamics and good oxygenation, and infection was controlled. ECMO was used for 90 hours and the baby was weaned smoothly. Neurologic assessment after ECMO revealed hydrocephalus, abnormal electroencephalogram, and increased brain auditory evoked potential threshold. This report emphasizes that ECMO may be considered to rescue neonatal patients with cardiopulmonary failure due to GBS sepsis. Possible neurologic complications after ECMO should be carefully monitored."

Enhanced surveillance for invasive GAS, GBS, GCS and GGS was performed in Denmark in 1999-2002. A detailed questionnaire was completed for 1237 (98%) of 1260 invasive infections. GAS infections dominated (40%), followed by GGS (32%), GBS (23%) and GCS (6%). Most (74%) patients had predisposing factors, and there were no significant differences between the four serogroups when comparing the prevalence of cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart or lung diseases, immunodeficiency or alcohol abuse. The overall case fatality rate at day 30 was 21%, increasing significantly to 59% for patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). STSS was significantly more frequent in GAS patients (10%) than in GCS (4%), GBS (2%) and GGS (2%) patients.

Differences in maternal and neonatal characteristics between early- and late-onset disease (EOD, LOD) were determined. RESULTS: There were 32,029 live births and 29 neonates were admitted for GBS infection, an incidence of 0.91/1000 live births (95% CI 0.58-1.23/1000). Twenty-one (72%) neonates had EOD, a rate of 0.66/1000 live births (95% CI 0.38-0.94/1000) and eight (28%) had LOD, a rate of 0.23/1000 (95% CI 0.08-0.42/1000). Seventeen of the 21 (81%) cases of EOD occurred within the 1st 24 hours of life. The most common clinical diagnosis was septicaemia (17, 61%), followed by pneumonia (8, 28%) and meningitis (3, 11%). All five (100%) babies whose mothers' membranes were ruptured for &gt;18 hours had EOD. The babies of all six (100%) women with intrapartum pyrexia went on to have EOD. A greater proportion of babies (63%) with LOD were preterm and of low birthweight. The most common presenting symptom was respiratory distress which occurred more frequently in neonates with EOD, p=0.006. One neonate died, giving a case fatality rate of 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of GBS infection is relatively low at UHWI, further reduction in the incidence might be achieved by implementation of measures to prevent perinatal transmission."

However, there are few data on the prevalence of neonatal GBS infections in China. The aim of this retrospective study was to estimate whether GBS is an important pathogen in severe neonatal pneumonia, and to develop a method for detection of GBS infections in fatal neonatal pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 234 neonatal cases (0 - 28 days) died in Beijing Children's Hospital from 1953 to 2004 were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups. Two hundred cases diagnosed as neonatal pneumonia were assigned to study group and the remaining 34 cases died of neonatal hemolysis or surgical operation without any confirmed infectious diseases were designated as control group. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissues were used as source for total genomic DNA extraction. PCR and Southern blot analyses were applied to detect GBS specific cfb gene target sequence. And the clinical data of these cases were reviewed as well. RESULTS: In the study group, 52 cases were detected positive for GBS DNA by PCR (26%), 130 cases were positive by Southern blot (65%). In the control group, 1 case was detected positive GBS DNA by PCR (3%), and 6 cases were positive by Southern blot (18%). The positive rate was significantly lower in the control group than that in the study group (PCR, chi(2) = 8.82, P &lt; 0.01; Southern blot, chi(2) = 26.77, P &lt; 0.01). The positive rate in the neonates younger than 7 days (early-onset) was significantly higher than that in neonates older than 7 days (late-onset) (PCR: 37% vs. 13%, chi(2) = 15.537, P &lt; 0.01; Southern blot: 72% vs. 52%, chi(2) = 4.37, P &lt; 0.05). In the positive early-onset cases, 39% of whom were born prematurely (29/74). Out of the 200 cases, 75 had complete clinical data. Neither blood nor lung culture for GBS was performed in any of these cases. But risk factors were identified for 35 cases, such as premature delivery, low birth weight, premature rupture of the membrane and abnormal amniotic fluid. GBS was positive in all these cases. Severe apnea appeared to be a common symptom and was present in most of the early-onset GBS-positive cases, while cough and wheezing were found in most of the late-onset GBS-positive cases. In the control group, one PCR positive case was suffered from malignant teratoma. The other 5 positive cases confirmed by Southern blot were diagnosed as kernicterus, hepatoma, aproctia complicating with cysti-urethral fistula, neonatal physio logical bleeding and aproctia complicated with archo-perineal fistula. CONCLUSION: Group B Streptococcus is an important pathogen in fatal neonatal pneumonia, especially in early-onset cases. southern blot may be a sensitive method to detect GBS infection in archival tissues. In the clinical work, more attention should be paid to the neonates with GBS risk factors. And GBS detection and prevention in neonates should be put into clinical practice."

Notably, infections due to group A and group B beta-hemolytic strains are well known for causing invasive disease leading to death. These deaths, while often suspected clinically, occasionally are not diagnosed until autopsy. We present 3 rapid deaths, with very different presentations, due to streptococcal infection. Two decedents experienced sudden deaths due to pneumonia and severe meningoencephalitis caused by group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, a common cause of neonatal meningitis but only rarely reported in nonpregnant adults. The final case involves a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of shoulder pain but over the next several hours developed signs of necrotizing fasciitis, became septic, and died. While antemortem cultures were negative, owing to antibiotic administration, postmortem cultures of bone and deep soft tissue were positive for group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus sp. Acute and sudden deaths due to infectious etiology represent an uncommon yet well-documented occurrence. The importance of appropriate postmortem cultures in these situations and a review of the literature will be discussed."

Fluid management is crucial in these patients, and continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) should be considered a therapeutic option even in newborn babies. CASE REPORT: After an uneventful pregnancy within hours after birth, a female term infant presented with dyspnoea, irritability and cyanosis. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) progressed to multi-organ dysfunction with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), impaired myocardial contractility, pulmonary hypertension and fluid overload. The maximum PRISM score was 51. The child required maximal respiratory and inotropic support with high volume intravenous fluid administration. However, only by using of CVVH from day 5 to 14, we successfully resolved progressive pulmonary and cardiovascular dysfunction. The child improved directly after initiation of fluid removal, was extubated on day 17 and discharged without obvious sequelae on day 57. All microbiology studies revealed GBS. CONCLUSION: Perinatal GBS-infections remain a major life-threatening event for newborn babies. CVVH should be considered an option for reversing fluid overload even in neonates with overwhelming SIRS. Alternatively, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is discussed."

Beyond the neonatal period, S. agalactiae is rarely found in the respiratory tract. During 2002-2008 we noticed S. agalactiae in respiratory secretions of 30/185 (16%) of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The median age of these patients was 3-6 years older than the median age CF patients not harboring S. agalactiae. To analyze, if the S. agalactiae isolates from CF patients were clonal, further characterization of the strains was achieved by capsular serotyping, surface protein determination and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). We found a variety of sequence types (ST) among the isolates, which did not substantially differ from the MLST patterns of colonizing strains from Germany. However serotype III, which is often seen in colonizing strains and invasive infections was rare among CF patients. The emergence of S. agalactiae in the respiratory tract of CF patients may represent the adaptation to a novel host environment, supported by the altered surfactant composition in older CF patients."

We used population-based surveillance to examine trends in adult GBS disease during the period 1990-2007 and to describe the epidemiology of adult GBS disease to guide prevention efforts. METHODS: Active Bacterial Core surveillance was conducted in selected counties in 10 US states. A case was defined as isolation of GBS from a normally sterile site in a nonpregnant resident of a surveillance area who was 18 years of age. Rates were calculated using US Census data. Demographic and clinical information was abstracted from medical records. Serotyping and susceptibility testing were performed on isolates collected from a subset of case patients. RESULTS: A total of 19,512 GBS cases were identified in nonpregnant adults during 1990-2007 (median patient age, 63 years); the incidence of adult GBS disease doubled from 3.6 cases per 100,000 persons during 1990 to 7.3 cases per 100,000 persons during 2007 (P &lt; .001). The mean difference in incidence between black and white persons was 4.6 cases per 100,000 persons (range, 3.1 cases per 100,000 persons during 1991 to 5.8 cases per 100,000 persons during 1999). Common clinical syndromes in 2007 included bacteremia without focus (39.3%), skin and/or soft-tissue infection (25.6%), and pneumonia (12.6%). Most (88.0%) GBS cases in adults had 1 underlying condition; diabetes was present in 44.4% of cases. Serotypes V, Ia, II, and III accounted for 80.8% of infections during 1998-1999 and 78.5% of infections during 2005-2006. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive GBS disease in nonpregnant adults represents a substantial and increasing burden, particularly among older persons, black persons, and adults with diabetes.

The disease can present in two forms: early clinical manifestation with respiratory distress soon after birth or late presentation with gradual onset of signs of sepsis. The former carries a high risk for serious cardiovascular complication with persistent pulmonary hypertension; the latter is often complicated with meningitis that may lead to serious neurodevelopmental impairment. An important advance in the past three decades is the development and implementation of preventive strategy for this disease by universal screening and identification of maternal GBS carriers and/or risk factors with subsequent use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The strategy has resulted in a significant reduction of the disease from 1.5 to 0.3/1,000 live births over the past three decades. Some women may have unknown GBS status.

Supportive care with non-invasive respiratory support is the norm. Animal models suggest that intrapartum exposure to group B Streptococcus (GBS) may cause mild pulmonary hypertension in the neonate, resulting in self-resolving respiratory distress. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension are currently not provided to neonates with self-limited respiratory distress empirically. OBJECTIVES: This study examines the hypothesis that the incidence and severity of self-limited respiratory distress are altered by intrapartum exposure to GBS and antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in a human population. METHODS: This is a 10-year single-center cohort study of retrospective data of late preterm and term neonates diagnosed with self-limited respiratory distress. Multiple logistic models were fitted to examine associations between exposure to GBS and IAP, and markers of self-limited respiratory distress severity. Additional linear regression models were fitted to examine the association between exposure to GBS and IAP, and duration of respiratory support for self-limited respiratory distress. Finally, crude and gestational age-adjusted incidence of self-limited respiratory distress among GBS-exposed and -unexposed infants, as well as the odds of self-limited respiratory distress based on GBS exposure were calculated. RESULTS: 584 neonates met study criteria. Neither GBS exposure nor IAP exposure was associated with severity of self-limited respiratory distress in multiple models. Crude and adjusted incidence of self-limited respiratory distress among neonates did not differ by GBS exposure history. CONCLUSIONS: Although animal studies indicate that GBS-mediated pulmonary hypertension may contribute to self-limited respiratory distress, neither exposure to GBS nor IAP was associated with an increased severity or incidence of self-limited respiratory distress in our human study population. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension are unlikely to speed symptom resolution for patients with self-limited respiratory distress."

Although acquired asplenia/hyposplenism have been described in association with celiac disease and, less frequently, with autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome, the manifestations in this context are usually only detectable in the laboratory setting, with Howell-Jolly bodies or thrombocytosis.

After appropriate immunizations, the patient has been free from clinically important infections. CONCLUSION: Hyposplenism should be suspected in patients with adult-onset infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, especially if autoantibodies are present. Early diagnosis can help prevent potentially life-threatening infections. Possible associations between splenic atrophy and Sjogren's syndrome are discussed."

We investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. METHODS: A retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. RESULTS: There were 40 (2.3%) PICU patients with streptococcal isolations including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS, n = 7), Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS, n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. Comparing among GAS, GBS and SP, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for GAS or SP (P = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for GBS (P = 0.002). All GAS and GBS, and the majority of SP (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. All SP specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. These infections were associated with high PICU mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. Isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. Patients with GAS, SP or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI), P value] of PICU deaths of 7.5 (CI 3.1-18.1, P &lt; 0.0001), 4.5 (CI 2.0-9.8, P &lt; 0.0002) and 5.7 (CI 3.4-9.5, P &lt; 0.0001), respectively. In SP, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +- seizure disorders, chromosomal or genetic disorders (P = 0.003) than children &lt;5 years of age. Serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19A, 6B, 3 and 6C. There were four SP deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two 19A and two serotype 3). CONCLUSIONS: Severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. GAS and SP affect the lungs of children, whereas GBS more likely causes meningitis in infants. The expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19A, 19F, 6B and 3."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fifteen isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae collected from urine specimens of patients attending a hospital in Tehran. All isolates were screened for their capsular types and genes encoding resistance to the macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics by PCR and multiplex PCR-based methods. RESULTS: Most of isolates belonged to capsular types III (49%), V (19%), II (16%), and Ib (6%). Twelve isolates (10%) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin and Quinupristin-dalfopristin, but were resistant to clindamycin (35%), chloramphenicol (45%), erythromycin (35%), linezolid (1%) and tetracycline (96%). The most prevalent antimicrobial resistance gene was tetM found in 93% of the isolates followed by ermTR, ermB, and tetK, found in 23%, 16%, and 16% of isolates, respectively. The genes, tetL, tetO, ermA, ermC and mefA were not detected in any of the S. agalactiae isolates. Of the 110 tetracycline resistant S. agalactiae, 89 isolates harbored the tetM gene alone and eighteen isolates carried the tetM gene with the tetK gene. All erythromycin-resistant isolates exhibited cMLSB resistance phenotype, 22 isolates harbored the ermTR gene alone and five isolates carried the ermTR gene with the ermB gene. The rate of coexistence of genes encoding the erythromycin and tetracycline resistance determinants was 34%. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that S. agalactiae isolates obtained from urine samples showed a high rate of resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and macrolide antibiotics and were commonly associated with the resistance genes temM, ermTR or ermB."

During the last few decades, there has been news of growing antibiotic resistance in group B streptococci to penicillin and different antibiotic agents. This clinical study retrospectively analyzes antimicrobial resistance in inpatients who were diagnosed with group B streptococcal pneumonia. METHODS: All of the required information from inpatients who were identified to have group B streptococcal pneumonia was sourced from the database at the Department of Internal Medicine of HELIOS Clinic Wuppertal, Witten/Herdecke University, in Germany, from 2004-2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for the different antimicrobial agents that were regularly administered to these inpatients. RESULTS: Sixty-six inpatients with a mean age of 63.3 +- 16.1 years (45 males [68.2%, 95% CI 60.0%-79.4%] and 21 females [31.8%, 95% CI 20.6%-43.0%]) were detected to have group B streptococcal pneumonia within the study period from January 1, 2004, to August 12, 2014. Group B Streptococcus had a high resistance rate to gentamicin (12.1%), erythromycin (12.1%), clindamycin (9.1%), and co-trimoxazole (3.0%), but it was not resistant to penicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, or vancomycin (P &lt; 0.0001).

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological aspects of S. agalactiae infections in cancer patients treated at a Reference Brazilian National Cancer Institute - INCA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We reviewed the clinical and laboratory records of all cancer patients identified as having invasive S. agalactiae disease during 2010-2014. The isolates were identified by biochemical analysis and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. A total of 263 strains of S. agalactiae were isolated from cancer patients who had been clinically and microbiologically classified as infected. S. agalactiae infections were mostly detected among adults with solid tumors (94 %) and/or patients who have used indwelling medical devices (77.2 %) or submitted to surgical procedures (71.5 %). Mortality rates (in-hospital mortality during 30 days after the identification of S. agalactiae) related to invasive S. agalactiae infections (n = 28; 31.1 %) for the specific category of neoplasic diseases were: gastrointestinal (46 %), head and neck (25 %), lung (11 %), hematologic (11 %), gynecologic (4 %), and genitourinary (3 %). We also found an increase in S. agalactiae resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin and the emergence of penicillin-less susceptible isolates. A remarkable number of cases of invasive infections due to S. agalactiae strains was identified, mostly in adult patients. Our findings reinforce the need for S. agalactiae control measures in Brazil, including cancer patients. "

In this study, 15 cases of neonatal Streptococcus agalactiae sepsis from our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, nine cases showed early-onset and six cases showed late-onset sepsis. Pathogens were characterized by genotyping and antibiotic sensitivity tests on blood cultures. Results demonstrated that in cases with early-onset sepsis, clinical manifestations affected mainly the respiratory tract, while late-onset sepsis was accompanied by intracranial infection. Therefore, we suggest including a cerebrospinal fluid examination when diagnosing neonatal sepsis. Bacterial genotyping indicated the bacteria were mainly type Ib, Ia, and III S. agalactiae. We recommend treatment with penicillin or ampicillin, since bacteria were resistant to clindamycin and tetracycline. In conclusion, our results provide valuable information for the clinical treatment of S. agalactiae sepsis in neonatal infants. "

Although screening and intra partum antibiotic prophylaxis are frequently performed, vertically transmitted GBS remain a challenge for pediatrics. AIMS: In order to prevent or reduce potential life-threatening events, this study retrospectively investigated epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of infants admitted to the Division of Neonatology at the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany (UHF). STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Between January 2010 and January 2016, perinatal GBS screening status, clinical presentation of EOD or LOD and therapeutic management of neonates admitted to UHF were retrospective analysed. Infants tested positive for GBS within their first three months of life were included; patient data were obtained from the chart report. Severity of neonatal disease was analysed by using the NEOMOD and CRIB score. RESULTS: 108 GBS infected infants born to 105 mothers were observed. N=101 of them (93.5%) presented with EOD, whereof n=9 (10%) primarily presented with pneumonia or pneumothorax. In 82 (78%) mothers of infected infants GBS status was unknown prior to hospitalization of the neonate. 3/108 (2.8%) infants died from GBS septicemia. CONCLUSION: Avoidance of GBS transmission sub partu is the key issue in preventing neonatal GBS infection and should be the focus of preventive strategies. Our results highlight the impact of perinatal screening."

GBS can also cause severe infections in pregnant women and adults with underlying disease, as well as mild diseases, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs). GBS strains exhibit 10 different serotypes, and the identification of serotype distribution is important epidemiologically. The role of biofilm production is one of the virulence factors that has been discussed in the pathogenesis of GBS infections. Although resistance to penicillin and ampicillin has not been documented in GBS, different rates of resistance has been reported for the alternative antibiotics to penicillin. The aim of this study was to investigate the serotype distribution, the ability of biofilm formation and the antibiotic susceptibilities of S.agalactiae strains isolated from urine cultures. A total of 60 strains were included in the study, 40 of them were isolated from patients (38 female 2 male; mean age: 36.7 years) with urinary tract complaints whose cultures yielded single type of colonies in the number of &gt;= 50.000 cfu/ml, whereas 20 of them were isolated from patients (19 female 1 male; mean age: 37.2 years) without urinary tract complaints whose cultures yielded mixed colonies in the number of &lt;= 20.000 cfu/ml. Chromogenic media were used for the isolation and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. The isolates were then serotyped by latex agglutination method and their antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion method recommended by CLSI documents. Biofilm formation of the strains were investigated by microplate and Congo red agar (CRA) methods. In our study, the most frequently detected serotypes were V (n= 18; 30%) and II (n= 14; 23.3%), followed by serotype Ia (n= 10; 16.7%), III (n= 9; 15%), Ib (n= 3; 5%), VI (n= 1; 1.7%) and VII (n= 1; 1.7%). Serotype IV, VIII and IX were not detected, while four (6.7%) isolates were untypeable. Serotype V (13/40; 32.5%) and serotip II (6/20; 30%) were in the first line among the strains isolated from patient and control groups, respectively. All of the GBS isolates were found susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin and cefotaxime. The rates of resistance against ofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin in patient group were found as 22.5%, %10 and 5%, respectively. In the control group resistance rates against erythromycin and clindamycin were both 10%, while no resistance was detected to the other antibiotics. The ofloxacin resistance in the patient group was found significantly higher than that of control group (p= 0.02). By microplate method, the percentage of moderate/strong biofilm producers was found as 42.5% (17/40) in the patient group and 20% (4/20) in the control group, however the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p= 0.08). All GBS strains were detected as positive by the CRA method, and it has been suggested that this might have been due to the binding of Congo red to sialic acid found in the GBS capsule, therefore this method thought to be improper for the investigation of biofilm formation in GBS strains. In conclusion, the most frequent serotypes of the GBS urinary isolates in our study were similar with the frequent serotypes reported in other studies. Our data have pointed out that the biofilm formation of GBS may not play a role in the pathogenesis of UTIs. In the meantime the high quinolone resistance detected in our study should be considered in the treatment of UTI due to GBS. "

Among these cases, bacteremia without primary focus was the most common variety of infection (49.9%), followed by cellulitis (12.9%) and pneumonia (9.0%). Concerning patient age (18 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, 80 to 89, and 90 years old or older), the incidence of pneumonia increased in patients in their 70s and 80s (P &lt; 0.001), while younger patients (18 to 59 and 60 to 69 years old) were more likely to have abscesses (P &lt; 0.05). The mortality rate was 10.2% for all ages. The most common capsular serotype was Ib (39.5%), followed by V (16.0%), III (13.8%), VI (9.5%), and Ia (8.6%). The main ST of serotype Ib strains was ST10, which belonged to clonal complex 10 (88.0%). The predominant clonal complexes of serotypes V and III, respectively, were 1 (78.9%) and 19 (75.4%). Among these isolates, 9 strains (2.0%) were identified as group B streptococci with reduced penicillin susceptibility, reflecting amino acid substitutions in penicillin-binding protein 2X (PBP2X). In addition, 19.2% of all strains possessed mef(A/E), erm(A), or erm(B) genes, which mediate macrolide resistance, while 40.2% of strains were resistant to quinolones resulting from amino acid substitutions in GyrA and ParC. Our data argue strongly for the continuous surveillance of microbial characteristics and judicious antibiotic use in clinical practice."

Infants acquire bacteria that cause neonatal sepsis directly from the mother's blood, skin or vaginal tract either before or during delivery. Nosocomial and environmental pathogens introduce further risk after delivery. The absence of cohesive medical systems and methods for collecting information limits the available data in countries such as Haiti. This study seeks to add more information on the burden of severe bacterial infections and their etiology in neonates of Haiti. Researchers conducted a secondary retrospective analysis of a de-identified database from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Nos Petit Freres et Soeurs-St. Damien Hospital (NPFS-SDH). Records from 1292 neonates admitted to the NICU at NPFS-SDH in Port-au-Prince Haiti from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. Sepsis accounted for 708 of 1292 (54.8%) of all admissions to the NICU. Infants admitted for sepsis had a mortality rate of 23% (163 of 708 infants admitted for sepsis). The most common organism cultured was Streptococcus agalactiae, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginusa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabillis Failure to order or obtain a culture was associated with an increased fatality (odds ratio 2.4) for infants with sepsis.

GBS also causes invasive disease in older infants, pregnant women, children and young adults with underlying medical conditions, and older adults. Resistance to lincosamides in the absence of erythromycin resistance is rare in GBS, but has been previously reported in clinical isolates, both on its own or in combination with resistance to streptogramins A and pleuromutilins (L/LSA/LSAP phenotypes). Objectives: To retrospectively screen the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) GBS isolate collection for these phenotypes in order to identify the causal genetic determinants and determine whether their frequency is increasing. Methods: Based on MIC data, 65 (0.31%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin (MIC &lt;=0.25 mg/L) and non-susceptible to clindamycin (MIC &gt;=0.5 mg/L) were identified among 21 186 GBS isolates. Genomic DNA was extracted and WGS was performed. The presence of 10 genes previously associated with LSA resistance was investigated by read mapping. Results: Forty-nine (75%) isolates carried the lsa (C) gene and expressed the LSAP phenotype, and 12 (18%) carried both the lnu (B) and lsa (E) genes and expressed the LSAP phenotype. The four remaining isolates were negative for all determinants investigated. Conclusions: While the overall observed frequency of these phenotypes among our GBS isolates was quite low (0.31%), this frequency has increased in recent years.

However, once the disease spreads it can lead to life-threatening illness despite advances in diagnostic and treatment modalities, partly because the symptoms and signs associated with pericarditis are frequently missing, and due to the rarity of the disease, diagnosis is often overlooked. We report an extremely rare case of purulent pericarditis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old diabetic woman presented with generalized weakness, high-grade fever, and altered mental status. There were no signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac tamponade on presentation. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a small pericardial effusion. She was managed for diabetic ketoacidosis and sepsis. An electrocardiogram was significant for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Her clinical status deteriorated rapidly as she developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and shock. A bedside echocardiogram showed large pericardial effusion around the right ventricle and right ventricular diastolic collapse. She developed cardiac arrest, and during resuscitation bedside pericardiocentesis was done with drainage of 15 cc of serosanguineous fluid. However, the patient could not be revived. Subsequently, blood cultures grew Streptococcus agalactiae a day after she died. On autopsy, she was found to have findings of infective endocarditis and purulent pericarditis. CONCLUSIONS A high index of clinical suspicion is crucial when acute pericarditis is suspected, for early diagnosis and for timely initiation of appropriate therapy with antibiotics and aggressive pericardial drainage to prevent fatal outcome."

METHODS: A retrospective case series study was performed at a high-capacity neonatal unit in Shanghai, China from January 2008 to December 2015. Clinical characteristics of neonates with culture-proven GBS sepsis and antibiotic susceptibility of isolated strains were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-three term neonates were included during the study period. The majority (74.4%) had early-onset sepsis with symptoms of respiratory distress. Meningitis was significantly more common in lateonset sepsis than in early-onset sepsis (81.5% vs. 18.8%, P&lt;0.0001). Approximately one third of all patients (n=16) developed severe sepsis, defined as sepsis with organ dysfunctions, and respiratory dysfunction/failure was the most common (32.6%). The in-hospital mortality rate of GBS sepsis was 4.7%. Neonates who progressed to severe sepsis had significantly lower pH level at the onset of symptoms than those who did not (7.26+-0.12 vs. 7.39+-0.05, P=0.006). Treatment of severe GBS sepsis required lots of medical resources including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All tested GBS strains were susceptible to penicillin, but the rate of resistance to clindamycin (84.0%) and erythromycin (88.0%) was high. CONCLUSIONS: GBS as a pathogen for neonatal sepsis has been receiving little attention in China. Our data demonstrated that GBS sepsis was likely to be fulminant. Early recognition followed by antibiotics and adequate supportive therapies was critical for successful treatment. Chinese clinicians should be aware of GBS infection when treating neonatal sepsis, especially in the absence of universal maternal GBS screening."

Susceptibilities to different antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution. Molecular studies of levofloxacin-resistant isolates included serotyping, PFGE, mutations in the QRDRs and MLST. Results: A total of 1559 isolates were tested and all remained susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins, meropenem and vancomycin. However, levofloxacin resistance increased from 2.2% (range 0%-3.3%) in 2002-06 to 6.2% (5.9%-7.5%) in 2008-12 (P = 0.016). Among the 88 levofloxacin-resistant isolates, the majority (79.5%) had the GyrA(S81L)+ParC(S79F/Y) double mutations and most (54.5%) were also resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline. The predominant genotype of the levofloxacin-resistant isolates was ST19/serotype III (43.2%). Four previously unreported genotypes, ST1 and its single-locus variants (ST920 and ST922)/serotype VI (28.4%) and ST1/serotype II (18.2%), were found to have circulated locally. Serotype III isolates were predominately from urine and female genital tract specimens and &lt;65-year-old adult outpatients, while serotype II and VI isolates were mostly from respiratory and urine samples and &gt;65-year-old inpatients. Multivariate analysis revealed that elderly age and respiratory samples were independent factors associated with levofloxacin resistance. Conclusions: Multiclonal emergence and dissemination of levofloxacin-resistant GBS isolates occurred in healthcare and community settings in Taiwan. Continuous molecular-level surveillance is important to detect new epidemic trends."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus agalactiaeID:28969684TITLE:Group B streptococcus (GBS) is an important pathogen in human disease- but what about in cystic fibrosis?ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common commensal capable of causing severe invasive infections. Most GBS infections occur in neonates (often as pneumonia). GBS can also cause infection in adults with diabetes and other immunological impairments but rarely leads to pneumonia in adults. GBS has occasionally been found in the sputum of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, an inherited condition known for progressive lung disease. However, the epidemiology and clinical significance of GBS in CF are not understood. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a large single-centre adult CF population with an associated comprehensive, prospectively collected bacterial biobank beginning in 1978. We identified all individuals with GBS isolated from their sputum on at least one occasion. The primary outcome was risk of pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) at the time of the first GBS isolate compared to the preceding visit. Secondary outcomes included determining: prevalence of GBS infection in a CF population, whether GBS infections where transient or persistent, whether GBS strains were shared among patients, change in % predicted FEV1 at the time of GBS isolate compared to the preceding visit, PEx frequency after the first GBS isolate, change in % predicted FEV1 after the first GBS isolate, and complications of GBS infection. RESULTS: GBS was uncommon, infecting 3.5% (11/318) adults within our cohort. Only three individuals developed persistent GBS infection, all lasting &gt; 12 months. There were no shared GBS strains among patients. PEx risk was not increased at initial GBS isolation (RR 5.0, CI 0.69-36.1, p=0.10). In the two years preceding initial GBS isolation compared to the two following years, there was no difference in PEx frequency (median 2, range 0-4 vs 1, range 0 to 5, respectively, p=0.42) or lung function decline, as measured by % predicted FEV1, (median -1.0%, range -19 to 7% vs median -6.0%, range -18 to 22%, p=0.86). There were no invasive GBS infections. CONCLUSION: In adults with CF, GBS is uncommon and is generally a transient colonizer of the lower airways. Despite the presence of structural lung disease and impaired innate immunity in CF, incident GBS infection did not increase PEx risk, PEx frequency, rate of lung function decline, or other adverse clinical outcomes."

Due to the widespread availability of antibiotics, empyema necessitans is rare in modern medicine and is most commonly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A 38-year-old immunocompetent male presented with left shoulder pain and his chest radiograph revealed a mass in the upper left lung and/or pleural space. He underwent multiple debridements of the chest wall due to a left chest wall abscess and empyema necessitans. All operative samples were positive for Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus). The patient's clinical course was complicated by septic arthritis of the left sternoclavicular joint and first rib, vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, and pelvic abscesses. This case report illustrates the pathogenic process of empyema necessitans and summarizes the clinical management for practicing clinicians. It also documents the second case of Streptococcus agalactiae-associated empyema necessitans, to our knowledge, with significantly greater disease extension than the first."

We investigated whether RV infection is a major cause of neonatal fever and compared the clinical characteristics of bacterial infection, viral infection and unknown causes of neonatal fever. METHOD: We reviewed the electronic medical records of 48 newborns aged &lt;=28 days who were admitted to the Special Care Nursery of Hanyang University Guri Hospital for fever (&gt;=38 C) from 2005 to 2009. All the newborns underwent complete blood count, urinalysis, C-reactive protein, cultures of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid as well as stool RV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction for cough or rhinorrhea, and stool culture for diarrhea were also done. RESULTS: All the babies were term, with mean age 13 +- 8 days and peak body temperature 38.5 +- 0.5 C. The causes of neonatal fever were viral (44%), bacterial (10%) and unknown (46%). The viral infections included RV (n = 12), enterovirus (n = 6), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2), and rhinovirus (n = 1). All the rotavirus genotypes were G4P[6]. Only three of 12 RV-infected febrile newborns had diarrhea. The bacterial infections included three cases of urinary tract infection (Escherichia coli, n = 2; Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1), and two cases of sepsis complicated with meningitis (all Streptococcus agalactiae). CONCLUSIONS: RV infection is the most common single cause of neonatal fever. It may be necessary to include stool RV tests for febrile newborns."

Maternal colonization with GBS is the principal risk factor for early-onset disease in infants. Group B Streptococcus is now an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world. In Ethiopia, few studies have been done on GBS colonization among pregnant women. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of GBS colonization, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and assess risk factors among pregnant women. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August 2014 at selected public antenatal care (ANC) centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Clinical and socio-demographical data were collected using structured questionnaire after obtaining written informed consent. A total of 281 lower vaginal swabs were collected and inoculated into 1 ml Todd Hewitt Broth supplemented with gentamicin and nalidixic acid to prevent the growth of contaminants. After overnight incubation, all broths were subcultured on 5% sheep blood agar for isolation of GBS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to the criteria of the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines 2013 by disk diffusion method. Data were entered and analysed using SPSS version 20.0 software. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were used. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GBS colonization among pregnant women was 14.6% (41/281). Group B Streptococcus colonization was significantly associated with health institutions (P &lt; 0.05). All GBS isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Resistance to tetracycline, cefotaxime, clindamycin, penicillin, vancomycin, ampicillin and erythromycin was 90.2%, 34.1, 26.8%, 19.5, 17%, 14.6 and 7.5% respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR) (&gt;= 2 drugs) was detected in 43.9% (18/41) of the isolates. CONCLUSION: There was a high frequency of GBS colonization (14.6%) and resistance to the commonly used antibiotics which suggests the importance of the screening of GBS colonization in pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation and testing their antimicrobial susceptibilities in order to provide antibiotic prophylaxis and minimize newborn infection and co-morbidity."

METHODS: The GBS serotype was determined by strep-B-Latex rapid agglutination method and multiplex PCR assay based on the differences among serotypes. Alleles and multilocus sequence types (MLST) were determined using the GBS MLST Website. RESULTS: Four GBS serotypes (Ia, Ib, III, and V) were identified, with serotype III which was intimately associated with purulent meningitis and sepsis, as the dominance. In EOD cases, sepsis and pneumonia showed dominance, but purulent meningitis was dominant in LOD cases. Also, a new ST-17 like type which might be a clone derive from ST-17 and emerge among neonatal disease cases was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of GBS serotype and genotype and their relation with GBS diseases guide the development of capsular polysaccharide vaccine."

In dairy cattle it commonly causes mastitis, with great economic losses, and there is scientific evidence of mastitis, caseous lymphadenitis, contagious skin necrosis and purulent infections associated with S. agalactiae in camels (Camelus dromedarius) as well. In humans, it is a common component of the respiratory and gastrointestinal microflora, but it can also act as a pathogen, especially in elderly people and immunocompromised patients, as well as in pregrant women and newborns. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year old non-pregnant female llama (Lama glama) was conferred to the Institute for Animal Health Control, in Bolzano for necropsy after sudden death. The animal had not shown unusual behaviour and had a low to normal nutritional condition (body condition score 2/5). The breeder had reported a chronic suppurative subcutaneous infection in the intermandibular area, resistant to therapy (therapy unknown). After necropsy, several samples were processed for histological, bacteriological and parasitological examinations. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes, to the best of our knowledge, the first isolation of S. agalactiae in llamas (Lama glama). The animal came from a herd that counts approximately 200 South American camelids (llamas, alpacas) along with several horses, chicken, rabbits, cats and dogs; this farm offers services, such as trekking and pet therapy activities."

This study aimed to investigate the incidence and mortality of invasive GBS infection and to identify the risk factors in our hospital. METHODS: Seventy-four cases admitted between January 2011 and December 2016 was included in this study. A retrospective matched case-control study was conducted in a tertiary maternity and paediatric hospital. Risk factors for the acquisition of invasive GBS infection and mortality were analysed by univariable and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: We collected and analysed data from 74 infants aged &lt; 3 months with invasive GBS infection. Among 67,985 live births, we calculated an incidence of 1.09 per 1000 live births (95%CI:0.81-1.37%); the incidence of Early-onset GBS disease (EOD, n = 65) and Late-onset GBS disease (LOD, n = 9) were 0.96%(95%CI:0.73-1.19%) and 0.13%(95%CI:0.04-0.22%), respectively. Overall, pneumonia accounted 63.1% (41/65) of EOD, and sepsis accounted 88.9% (8/9) cases of LOD, respectively. The overall case fatality rate was 8.11% (6/74), including 7.69% (5/65) among cases of EOD and 11.1% (1/9) among cases of LOD. No predictor of mortality was found.

The aim of this study was to quantify the role of GBS as a cause of surgical site and non-invasive infections at all ages. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017068914) and meta-analysis of GBS as a proportion (%) of bacterial isolates from surgical site infection (SSI), skin/soft tissue infection (SSTI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and respiratory tract infection (RTI) was conducted. RESULTS: Seventy-four studies and data sources were included, covering 67 countries. In orthopaedic surgery, GBS accounted for 0.37% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-1.68%), 0.87% (95% CI 0.33-2.28%), and 1.46% (95% CI 0.49-4.29%) of superficial, deep, and organ/space SSI, respectively. GBS played a more significant role as a cause of post-caesarean section SSI, detected in 2.92% (95% CI 1.51-5.55%), 1.93% (95% CI 0.97-3.81%), and 9.69% (95% CI 6.72-13.8%) of superficial, deep, and organ/space SSI. Of the SSTI isolates, 1.89% (95% CI 1.16-3.05%) were GBS. The prevalence of GBS in community and hospital UTI isolates was 1.61% (1.13-2.30%) and 0.73% (0.43-1.23%), respectively. GBS was uncommonly associated with RTI, accounting for 0.35% (95% CI 0.19-0.63%) of community and 0.27% (95% CI 0.15-0.48%) of hospital RTI isolates.

METHODS: A total of 859 women who delivered before term from January 2017 to January 2018 were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Bacterial culture was performed for GBS using the swabs collected from the rectum and the lower 1/3 of the vagina of the pregnant women on admission. A total of 515 of the above cases underwent real-time PCR assay for testing of GBS DNA. Bacterial culture was performed for GBS using the oropharyngeal secretion, gastric fluid or blood samples in preterm infants born to the 859 pregnant women. Peripheral blood samples from the pregnant women and umbilical cord blood samples from their preterm infants were collected to determine the level of anti-GBS capsular polysaccharide antibody. The incidence of GBS infection and perinatal risk factors for GBS colonization in the preterm infants were examined. RESULTS: The positive rate for GBS in the rectal and vaginal cultures was 14.8% (127/859) among the 859 pregnant women, and the positive rate in the GBS DNA testing was 15.1% (78/515). There were 976 live-birth preterm infants delivered by 859 pregnant women, and 4.4% (43/976) of whom were GBS positive. Four preterm infants had early-onset GBS diseases, including pneumonia in two cases and sepsis in two cases. In 127 preterm infants delivered by 127 GBS-positive pregnant women, the preterm infant group with a gestational age between 34 and 37 weeks had a significantly lower GBS positive rate and a significantly higher level of anti-GBS capsular polysaccharide antibody compared with the preterm infant group with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks (P=0.013 and 0.001 respectively). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that premature rupture of membranes time &gt;18 hours and chorioamnionitis were independent risk factors for GBS colonization in preterm infants (OR=6.556 and 6.160 respectively; P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: GBS positive rate and anti-GBS capsular polysaccharide antibody level in preterm infants are correlated with gestational age. premature rupture of membranes time &gt;18 hours and chorioamnionitis may increase the risk of GBS colonization in preterm infants."

The clinical characteristics, prognosis and drug resistance were reviewed and analyzed. According to the onset time, the patients were divided into early onset disease (EOD, 0-6 days), late onset disease (LOD, 7-89 days) and very late onset disease (VLOD, 90 days-16 years), the clinical features were compared. According to the results of cranial imaging examination, the patients were divided into two groups: those with neurological complications and those without neurological complications. The influencing factors of neurological complications were analyzed. According to the outcome of 28 days after discharge, patients were divided into death group and survival group. The risk factors of mortality were analyzed by multivariate Logistic regression analysis. Non-numeric variables were analyzed with chi(2) test or Fisher's exact test. Numeric variable between groups were compared with nonparametric test. Results: A total of 96 patients were enrolled, including 18 (19%) EOD, 71 (74%) LOD and 7 (7%) VLOD cases. The median age of EOD cases was 2 days, with a range from 0 to 6 days. The median age of LOD cases was 31 days, with a range from 7 to 81 days. The median age of VLOD cases was 153 days, with a range from 95 to 214 days. Before the onset of the disease, the mother had mastitis in 6 cases and premature rupture of membranes in 6 cases. The common clinical manifestations of patients were fever (95%, 91/96), anorexia (65%, 62/96), seizure (56%, 54/96), and consciousness changes (36%, 35/96). The differences were statistically significant in gender (13/18 vs. 28/71 vs. 5/7, chi(2)=7.705, P=0.024), the number of cases who was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) (5/18 vs. 31/71 vs. 0, chi(2)=6.065, P=0.042) and peripheral blood leukocyte (12(4, 18)x10(9)/L vs. 6(3, 11)x10(9)/L vs. 13(6, 17)x10(9)/L, H=9.885, P=0.007) in EOD group, LOD group and VLOD group.

METHODS: Systematic review using electronic databases to identify studies describing iGBS outbreaks/clusters or cross-infection/acquisition in healthcare settings where 'cluster' was defined as >=2 linked cases. PROSPERO CRD42018096297. RESULTS: Twenty-five references were included describing 30 hospital clusters (26 neonatal, 4 adult) in 11 countries from 1966 to 2019. Cross-infection between unrelated neonates was reported in 19 clusters involving an early-onset (<7 days of life; n = 3), late-onset (7-90 days; n = 13) index case or colonized infant (n = 3) followed by one or more late-onset cases (median serial interval 9 days (IQR 3-17, range 0-50 days, n = 45)); linkage was determined by phage typing in 3 clusters, PFGE/MLST/PCR in 8, WGS in 4, non-molecular methods in 4. Postulated routes of transmission in neonatal clusters were via clinical personnel and equipment, particularly during periods of crowding and high patient-to-nurse ratio.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-years-old man with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted in hospital for fever, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation cardioverted by Amiodarone and pulmonary infection. DIAGNOSIS: A case of recurrent severe endocarditis, with neurological complications both ischemic and hemorrhagic and heart failure caused by Streptococcus agalactiae in healthy man we reported. INTERVENTIONS: Surgery was performed 2 weeks after admission. OUTCOMES: The onset of intracranial hemorrhage delayed second cardiac surgery and the patient died because of end-stage heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis caused by S. agalactiae is very rare, particularly in patients without underlying structural heart disease. This study showed that IE due to S. Agalactiae is a disease with high mortality when associated with neurological complication, heart failure but especially when it is recurrent and hits valve prosthesis."

Physical and auxiliary examinations and PubMed search with keywords of ""GBS disease"" and ""intracranial hemorrhage"". The 86-day-old boy was admitted to hospital for respiratory arrest. High tension in bregma indicated intracranial infection. Laboratory examination showed low red blood cell account, low white blood cell account and high C-reactive protein account. Also, GBS was positive in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood culture. Computed tomography (CT) indicated intracranial hemorrhage. Meropenem and other supportive treatment started immediately. Because of the patient's poor condition, the patient's parents abandoned the treatment. As for literature review, intracranial hemorrhage is rarely seen in late-onset disease (LOD). The case contributes to further exploration on the syndromes of GBS disease. Clinical workers should notice the complexity of bacterial infection.

We aimed to describe the patient characteristics (Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]), treatment (3-h bundle), and outcomes in relation to bacterial virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (BHS). Methods: This sepsis primary study is part of the larger Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) study, a multicenter, prospective cohort study. We included patients diagnosed with S. pneumoniae and BHS sepsis and examined virulence, defining the high-virulence factor as follows: S. pneumoniae serotype 3, 31, 11A, 35F, and 17F; Streptococcus pyogenes, emm 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, III; and Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis, emm typing pattern stG 6792. Included patients were divided into high and normal categories based on the virulence factor. Results: Of 1,184 sepsis patients enrolled in the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine's FORECAST study, 62 were included in the current study (29 cases with S. pneumoniae sepsis and 33 with BHS). The CCI and completion of a 3-h bundle did not differ between normal and high virulence groups. Risk of 28-day mortality was significantly higher for high-virulence compared to normal-virulence when adjusted for CCI and completion of a 3-h bundle (Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, hazard ratio 3.848; 95% confidence interval, 1.108-13.370; P = 0.034).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the current epidemiology of a French administrative district population of proven EONI, including umbilical cord blood procalcitonin levels. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population-based study in the Nantes metropolitan area. We included all infants treated for proven EONI in the maternity, neonatology, and intensive care wards between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2015 in the Nantes University Hospital. RESULTS: Among the 140,502 children born during the study period, 61 cases of EONI were documented. The overall incidence of confirmed EONI was 0.43/1000 live births, with 0.23/1000 GBS (group B streptococcus) infections and 0.08/1000 Escherichia coli infections. The majority of infected newborns were full-term or late-preterm infants (67% were>=34 weeks of gestation), 88% had symptoms of EONI in the first 24h of life, most of which were respiratory. The mortality rate was 8% (in premature infants). Available in 51% of the population, the cord blood PCT value could contribute to an earlier diagnostic screening in 10% of cases but with a very low sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of confirmed EONI is low in this French district. The diagnostic value of PCT umbilical blood cord should be assessed based on further studies before confirming its value. We suggest that a national registry of these rare but serious cases of EONI could contribute to monitoring the epidemiological progression as well as to optimizing our diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

Determining the etiology and tailoring the treatment.ABSTRACT:In infantile pneumonia, we recommend close attention to the history and physical examination. Baseline studies, including CBC, ESR, blood cultures, and chest film, should be performed at onset and repeated as warranted. Nasopharyngeal secretions or washings should be drawn by means of gentle suction and specimens sent for Gram stain, fluorescent antibody stain for respiratory syncytial virus, and culture for bacteria and for viruses if possible. Acute and convalescent serum specimens should be obtained in serious cases to search for antibodies to RSV, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, cytomegalovirus, and Chlamydia. Serum and urine specimens may be collected for countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and latex agglutination testing for Hemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and if indicated, group B streptococcus. If deterioration continues and all tests are negative, the clinician should consider a more invasive procedure such as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, needle aspiration, or open lung biopsy. While awaiting identification of the pathogen, the physician should institute empiric therapy with optimum doses of antimicrobials and monitoring of serum levels of drug. Often the clinician is faced with deterioration and a negative workup. In this situation, other agents may be added, such as antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoan, and antituberculous agents, as well as various antibiotics, to cover rare and unusual pathogens. Further consultation, even by phone, may at this point provide some insight into an otherwise confusing case."

Right-sided Bochdalek hernia (RBH) occurs in about 1 of 20,000 live births. The combination of group B streptococcal sepsis and delayed appearance of a right Bochdalek hernia is an infrequently reported phenomenon--18 patients have been previously reported in the English literature. We add four patients from our own experience to these previous reports. Since approximately 10% to 15% of the newborn population are exposed to group B Streptococcus we suspect that the inadequate diaphragmatic motion on the side of the Bochdalek hernia predisposes the child to development of septicemia and/or pneumonitis. Once the etiology has been established and appropriate antibiotic therapy instituted, progressive improvement in the patient's course should be seen. This is in contrast to a very significant mortality rate in many of the patients having early onset GBS. Any child, therefore, surviving early onset GBS only to deteriorate again, should be suspected of having an associated right Bochdalek hernia, and diagnostic steps should be taken to evaluate the integrity of the right diaphragm."

This group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. We obtained 275 strains of the S. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. The 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. The primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections, 2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. The secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. The S. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. Among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the S. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to CCL and 33% to CTM. ABPC, CPDX, and CFDN were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests. Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. With antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense."

However, the bacteria in this group are primarily oral resident bacteria and unable to grow significantly on ordinary aerobic culture media. We experienced a case of pneumonia and empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius detected using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pleural effusion, but not sputum. Even when applying the molecular method, sputum samples are occasionally unsuitable for identifying the causative pathogens of lower respiratory tract infections. "

","SPECIES:Streptococcus anginosusID:26502716TITLE:The clinical features of respiratory infections caused by the Streptococcus anginosus group.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) play important roles in respiratory infections. It is ordinarily difficult to distinguish them from contaminations as the causative pathogens of respiratory infections because they are often cultured in respiratory specimens. Therefore, it is important to understand the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of respiratory infections caused by the SAG members. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of the SAG bacteria in respiratory infections. METHODS: A total of 30 patients who were diagnosed with respiratory infections which were caused by the SAG bacteria between January 2005 and February 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG were mostly seen in male patients with comorbid diseases and were typically complicated with pleural effusion. Pleural effusion was observed in 22 (73.3%) patients. Empyema was observed in half of the 22 patients with pleural effusion. S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus were detected in 16 (53.3 %), 11 (36.7 %) and 3 (10.0 %) patients, respectively. Six patients had mixed-infections. The duration from the onset of symptoms to the hospital visit was significantly longer in ""lung abscess"" patients than in ""pneumonia"" patients among the 24 patients with single infections, but not among the six patients with mixed-infection. The peripheral white blood cell counts of the ""pneumonia"" patients were higher than those of the ""lung abscess"" patients and S. intermedius was identified significantly more frequently in patients with pulmonary and pleural infections (pneumonia and lung abscess) than in patients with bacterial pleurisy only. In addition, the patients in whom S. intermedius was cultured were significantly older than those in whom S. constellatus was cultured. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG bacteria tended to be observed more frequently in male patients with comorbid diseases and to more frequently involve purulent formation. In addition, S. intermedius was mainly identified in elderly patients with having pulmonary infection complicated with pleural effusion, and the aspiration of oral secretions may be a risk factor in the formation of empyema thoracis associated with pneumonia due to S. intermedius."

Recent research suggests they play a role in exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). Owing to poor recovery on standard culture media and difficult differentiation from non-pathogenic streptococci, SMG may be underdiagnosed in routine settings. We aimed to establish the incidence of SMG in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients compared to CF patients and to examine possible links of SMG to exacerbations that plays a key role in progression of COPD. METHODS: Altogether, 90 respiratory tract samples of patients suffering from CF or COPD were examined during the period from July 2012 to December 2013. Semi-selective McKay agar was used for primary cultivation of SMG and MALDI TOF MS was used for species identification that was confirmed by biochemical profiling and specific PCR. RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of SMG in CF (17.6% incidence in adult patients) and newly established its presence in COPD (10.3% incidence). In COPD, SMG was detected in 4 cases of acute exacerbations, where no other bacterial pathogen was detected. In 3/4 cases, increased CRP level indicated bacterial infection as a cause of the exacerbation and in all 3 cases, patients recovered during antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate SMG may act as opportunist pathogens able to cause exacerbations in COPD."

Although several small studies have been reported, the features of SAG pneumonia remain unclear, because the identification of SAG from sputum cultures is not routinely performed in most microbiology laboratories. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics of SAG pneumonia. PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study utilizing data obtained in our hospital between September 2009 and June 2016. We investigated 31 patients with SAG pneumonia (PWP), and also assessed the difference between the 31 PWP and 37 patients without pneumonia (PWOP) in whose sputum SAG was detected. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the patients were men and the median age was 78 years in the PWP. Univariate analysis indicated that the PWP were significantly more often a bed-ridden (p &lt; 0.01) with comorbid aspiration than were the PWOP (p &lt; 0.05). Among the PWP, nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) was the more common type of pneumonia (54.8%). S. anginosus was detected significantly more frequently in sputum cultures of PWP than PWOP (p &lt; 0.01), and multiple pathogens were detected more frequently in PWP (p &lt; 0.01). Streptococcus constellatus was the most frequently detected pathogen in patients with a single bacterial infection. Empyema was observed only in patients with multiple bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: SAG should be recognized as important causative pathogens of pneumonia, particularly among elderly patients with underlying disease associated with aspiration. NHCAP was the more common type of SAG pneumonia in this study."

In the course of time, diagnostic criteria have been updated and validated to reduce misdiagnosis. Some risk factors and epidemiology have shown dynamic changes since degenerative valvular disease became more predominant in developed countries, and the mean age of the affected population increased. Despite streptococci have been being well known as etiologic agents, some groups, although rare, have been increasingly reported (e.g., Streptococcus milleri.) Intracardiac complications of IE are common and have a worse prognosis, frequently requiring surgical treatment. We report a case of a middle-aged diabetic man who presented with prolonged fever, weight loss, and ultimately severe dyspnea. IE was diagnosed based on a new valvular regurgitation murmur, a positive blood culture for Streptococcus anginosus, an echocardiographic finding of an aortic valve vegetation, fever, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Despite an appropriate antibiotic regimen, the patient died. Autopsy findings showed vegetation attached to a bicuspid aortic valve with an associated septal abscess and left ventricle and aortic root fistula connecting with the pulmonary artery.

Therefore, we evaluated the bacteriological incidence in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of pneumonia patients using cultivation and a culture-independent molecular method. Japanese patients with community-acquired pneumonia (83) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (94) between April 2010 and February 2014 were evaluated. The BALF obtained from pneumonia lesions was evaluated by both cultivation and a molecular method. In the molecular method, ~600 base pairs of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes in the BALF were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and clone libraries were constructed. The nucleotide sequences of 96 randomly selected colonies were determined, and a homology search was performed to identify the bacterial species. A qualitative radiological evaluation of pulmonary emphysema based on chest computed tomography (CT) images was performed using the Goddard classification. The severity of pulmonary emphysema based on the Goddard classification was none in 47.4% (84/177), mild in 36.2% (64/177), moderate in 10.2% (18/177), and severe in 6.2% (11/177). Using the culture-independent molecular method, Moraxella catarrhalis was significantly more frequently detected in moderate or severe emphysema patients than in patients with no or mild emphysematous changes. The detection rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unrelated to the severity of pulmonary emphysematous changes, and Streptococcus species - except for the S. anginosus group and S. pneumoniae - were detected more frequently using the molecular method we used for the BALF of patients with pneumonia than using culture methods. Our findings suggest that M. catarrhalis is more frequently detected in pneumonia patients with moderate or severe emphysema than in those with no or mild emphysematous changes on chest CT. M. catarrhalis may play a major role in patients with pneumonia complicating severe pulmonary emphysema."

It is characterized by infection involving the posterior compartment of the lateral pharyngeal space complicated by septic suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with F. necrophorum bacteremia and metastatic abscesses, primarily to the lung and pulmonary septic emboli. Herein, we present a very rare case of oropharyngeal infection complicated by Lemierre's syndrome with characteristic septic emboli to the lungs presenting as sore throat in a previously healthy patient.

Accurate understanding of the clinical characteristics and etiology of bacterial pleuritis is an issue that must be addressed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of the bacterial species in bacterial pleuritis. METHODS: Pleural effusion samples were obtained from 29 patients with bacterial pleuritis. The microbiota of pleural effusion samples was analyzed with clone library analysis using the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. RESULTS: The phylotypes of Fusobacterium spp. (24.1%) were most frequently the predominant phylotypes, followed by those of Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) (20.7%) and S. aureus (17.2%). The predominant phylotypes of obligate anaerobes, including the Fusobacterium spp., were detected in 11 of 29 patients (37.9%). Patients in the SAG group were significantly older and presented lower serum albumin levels than those in the obligate anaerobe and other bacteria groups. Patients from the obligate anaerobe group took longer to present symptoms, and therefore diagnosis of pleuritis was also delayed, in comparison to patients in the other bacterial group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that there were characteristic differences between patients in SAG, obligate anaerobe, and other bacterial groups. Physicians may need to consider treatment strategy options based on the clinical characteristics of patients with bacterial pleuritis."

Lemierre's syndrome is classically defined by an oropharyngeal infection with internal jugular vein thrombosis followed by metastatic infections in other organs. Case presentation: A 32-year-old female patient, with no significant past medical history, was diagnosed with a dental abscess on her left inferior 3rd molar. Six days later, the condition complicated with severe upper respiratory distress, odynophagia and trismus, and extension of the inflammatory signs to the anterior cervical region, involving the upper airway. Computed tomography scan confirmed extension to submandibular, parapharyngeal and retrosternal spaces), which required nasotracheal intubation due to compromised airway. Urgent and subsequent surgical drainages were performed, alongside with concomitant antibiotic therapy. Additionally, left internal jugular vein thrombosis was described - with later extension to the brachiocephalic vein, without other complications, consistent with Lemierre's syndrome, although without full features. Streptococcus anginosus was identified in the drained pus specimens. The patient made a satisfactory clinical progress and was discharged after 25 days, still under therapeutic hypocoagulation. Conclusion: As deep neck space infections can be life-threatening, clinicians must be aware and not underestimate their potential severity.

METHODS: A retrospective study of medical records, identifying invasive SAG bacteria of sterile-site isolates that were managed from May 2015 to April 2017, at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, site of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome were recorded and analyzed to identify factors associated with poor outcome and/or polymicrobial growth. RESULTS: We identified 105 cases of SAG infections in adults, with 52% of the patients being male and the mean age of 52.4 years with comorbidities occurring in more than half of the cases such as diabetes (38%) and malignancy (15%). Overall mortality was 6%, and it was statistically associated with age older than 65 years, polymicrobial growth and a history of malignancy. The infection frequencies were skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI; 55%), intra-abdominal infections (24%), bacteremia (14%), genitourinary infections (8.5%), and pleuropulmonary infections (5%). Abscesses accounted for 68% of cases. Polymicrobial infection (46%) with Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative anaerobes coincided with SAG infection. Polymicrobial growth was significantly associated with abscess formation, intra-abdominal source of infections, and poor outcome. In addition, death in patients with SAG was statistically associated with patients older than 65 years of age and those with history of cancer or transplant. CONCLUSION: SSTIs and intra-abdominal infections are the most common clinical presentations in our cohort. Bacteremia was uncommon; however, the prognosis is less favorable. Overall susceptibility to penicillin was 91%, therefore beta-lactam antibiotics are the drug of choice and additional coverage for anaerobic and gram-negative bacteria should be considered for intra-abdominal collection and solid or organ abscesses."

While the ""viridans"" streptococci cannot be serologically differentiated, physiological separation of the species offers a satisfactory method of classifying human isolates. We review the microbiology of Lancefield group F and related streptococci (S. milleri, S. anginosus), emphasizing microbial ecology and current taxonomic considerations. A series of 28 patients infected with these organisms is presented. There was a striking male predominance in the series (6:1) as well as an obvious association with underlying diseases and/or antecedent trauma. The most remarkable feature of these pathogens is their predilection for abscess formation, confirming their overdue recognition as the most common ""viridans"" streptococcus recovered from abscesses within internal organs. We observed purulent disease of the nervous and skeletal systems, oral cavity, lung and pleural space, abdomen and subcutaneous tissues. Microbial synergy (i.e. polymicrobic infection) was not a requisite for abscess formation. Four of the five deaths in this series occurred in patients 60 years of age of older. Some degree of variability in antimicrobial susceptibility was noted, so speciation alone may not always provide sufficient information on which to base a therapeutic decision."

The patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by Streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. The infectious diseases encountered among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. Six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. An underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. Six serum antibody titers for the S. milleri groups were examined in the First Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Ryukyus. Three cases for S. anginosus, two cases for S. intermedius, and one case for S. constellatus showed high titers of X1024 or X2048. Therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the S. milleri group. We also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by S. milleri and S. pneumoniae. There are more underlying diseases in infections caused by S. milleri than in those caused by S. pneumoniae. There were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by S. milleri than among those with S. pneumonia infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

METHODS: From March 1991 to April 1992 all the isolated strains of clinical significant samples were collected. For identification the API 20 STREP (BioMerieux) system was used. The histories of the patients with infection by S. anginosus were retrospectively reviewed to collect clinical and microbiologic data of interest. RESULTS: The 108 strains of St. anginosus isolated were diminute colonies on sheep blood agar with CO2 enrichment. They had a characteristic smell, were beta-hemolitic or non hemolitic and of the Lancefield group A, C, F, G or not groupable. All had invariable biochemical features in the API 20 STREP: produced acetone and alkaline phosphatase, hydrolized arginine, did not hydrolize hypurate nor did they ferment ribose. Streptococcus anginosus produced purulent infections of different localization: abdominal, head-neck, pleuro-pulmonary, muscle-skeletal, skin and soft tissues and miscellaneous. Most of these infections were polymicrobial (81.5%). CONCLUSIONS: St. anginosus was easily identified in the laboratory by its morphologic characteristics and biochemical reaction in the API 20 STREP. It produced a wide variety of supurative infections, some being severe: cerebral, pulmonary, hepatic, empyema abscess. The identification of this microorganism at a species level should contribute to better recognition as a pathogen of occassionally severe supurative infections."

Clinical features of upper respiratory tract infection and pyogenic pharyngitis as well as colony counts were tabulated for each patient according to throat culture results. Of 1,480 patients, Lancefield group C Streptococcus equisimilis was isolated from 45 (3%) patients and Streptococcus anginosus (""Streptococcus milleri"") was isolated from 164 (11.1%) patients. Patients from whom S. equisimilis was isolated had clinical features more suggestive of pyogenic infection than did patients from whom S. anginosus was isolated. Colony counts on primary throat culture plates from patients from whom S. equisimilis and Streptococcus pyogenes were isolated were higher than those from patients from whom S. anginosus was isolated.

An analysis of 18 episodes].ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus milleri group streptococci (SMG). METHODS: Prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. In this study all episodes caused by SMG were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by SMG (0.16/1,000 admissions). The mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. Seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. The most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. Four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. In 13 isolates the identification was at species level (Streptococcus anginosus eight, Streptococcus intermedius four and Streptococcus constellatus one). All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Six patients (33.3%) required surgery. In ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. The infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. The mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SMB bacteremia is uncommon. It involved mainly diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues. The mortality rate was high despite surgery in one third of patients. Patients with advanced age had a poorer prognosis. All isolates investigated were susceptible to penicillin."

However, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. Many of what we refer to as emerging diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. Thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of Legionella pneumophila infections. New diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. We summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (MDR tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes)."

Clinical variety of endocarditis manifestation is wide and has the potential to mimic vasculitis. Whereas Streptococcus bovis is often isolated and associated with colonic tumors, Neisseriaceae are rarely found. An association of subacute bacterial endocarditis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies has been described. We report on a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with acute oliguric renal failure and a nonpruritic purpural rush without fever. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody diagnostic revealed perinuclear staining with a titre of 1 : 512 and antiproteinase-3 specificity. Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis without extracapillary proliferation was diagnosed in renal biopsy. Finally, blood cultures became positive for Streptococcus bovis and Neisseria flava. Echocardiography showed mobile vegetations on tricuspid valve. Under treatment with penicillin G and gentamicin, skin efflorescences and renal function recovered, but vegetations increased. A colonic tumor could be excluded, a disastrous dental status may have been a predisposal factor. When classical findings of subacute bacterial endocarditis are less clear, the presence of renal failure and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in absence of fever may lead to misdiagnosis and deleterious immunosuppressive therapy. Neisseria subflava, an upper respiratory tract commensal, may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis without typical symptoms."

However, little is known about the clinical manifestations or the conditions that predispose to S. bovis infection in this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this case series and review of the literature was to describe cases of S. bovis infection treated at 2 children's hospitals and compare patients evaluated at our institutions with those reported in the literature. RESULTS: Seven infants with S. bovis infection were treated at our institutions; 4 of the patients had S. bovis meningitis and 3 of these also had S. bovis bacteremia. Five of the patients had signs of gastrointestinal disturbance at presentation. None of the 7 patients died. Twenty-three patients with S. bovis infection reported in the literature had meningitis with concurrent bacteremia (n = 9), bacteremia alone (n = 9), meningitis alone (n = 4), and pneumonia with overwhelming sepsis (n = 1). Six (26%) of the patients reported in the literature died as a consequence of S. bovis infection. The difference in median age between our patients (14 days; range, 1-43 days) and those reported in the literature (3 days; range, 1-60 days) was not statistically significant (P = 0.49). Abdominal distention was more commonly noted among patients in our series (71%) than among patients reported in the literature (10%; odds ratio = 21.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-319.0).

The diagnosis of tricuspid endocarditis was possible only 2 months later on the basis of echocardiography requested because of the onset of a tricuspid systolic murmur. Blood cultures revealed the presence in succession of streptococcus D fecalis then bovis. Antibiotics, changed several times because of the onset of complications (allergy, agranulocytosis), failed to deal with the problem of infection as shown by the development of several septic pulmonary emboli which finally resulted in total tricuspidectomy with neither immediate nor secondary valve replacement. The authors use this clinical case to review the characteristics of tricuspid endocarditis, the incidence of which is on the increase in certain etiological contexts (staphylococcal endocarditis in drug addicts or secondary to central vascular lines). They stress that the clinical picture is often confusing since the murmur of tricuspid incompetence is absent in 2/3 of cases. Echocardiography must therefore be requested routinely in all septicemias, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and assessment of the risk of pulmonary embolism (risk if vegetation greater than 10 mm). The nature of the organism responsible may be suggestive of certain etiologies. Thus malignant disease of the colon should be sought if the bacterium is a streptococcus D bovis. Apart from antibiotics, treatment must include effective anticoagulation to decrease the risk of embolic recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Nevertheless, data concerning the impact of DM on the prognosis of patients with IE are limited and sometimes contradictory. We examined the impact of DM on the inhospital outcome of left-sided IE in a large cohort of patients. We studied 594 consecutive episodes of left-sided IE diagnosed at 3 tertiary care centers. They were divided into 2 groups: episodes in patients with DM (n = 114) and episodes in patients without DM (n = 480). We retrospectively analyzed the influence of DM therapy on patient outcome. Compared to patients without DM, patients with DM were older (67 +- 10 vs. 60 +- 15 yr; p &lt; 0.001), less frequently male (53.5% vs. 67.9%; p = 0.004), and more commonly had chronic renal failure (23.9% vs. 6.9%; p &lt; 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.6% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.019). Enterococcus (14.9% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.011) and Streptococcus bovis (8.8% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.024) were isolated more frequently. In the univariable analysis, septic shock (29.2% vs. 16.4%; p = 0.005) and mortality (43.5% vs. 30.0%; p = 0.008) were more common among patients with DM than in those without. Considering the different treatments for DM, septic shock (33.3%; p = 0.011) and death (50.8%; p = 0.012) were more frequent in patients receiving oral medication to treat diabetes than in patients with the other treatment modalities. However, multivariable analysis showed that DM had an independent association with development of septic shock (OR 2.282; 95% CI 1.186-4.393), but it was not a predictor of inhospital mortality.Staphylococci were the most frequently involved microorganisms in all patients; however, Enterococcus and Streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated from individuals with DM and left-sided IE, whereas viridans group streptococci were more commonly isolated from those with left-sided IE who did not have DM. DM was independently associated with the development of septic shock, but it was not an independent predictor of inhospital mortality in patients with left-sided IE. "

A critically ill 61-year-old man with intractable right ventricular heart failure was found to have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to Streptococcus bovis pulmonary valve endocarditis and underwent successful pulmonary valve replacement and PEA. The successful outcome in this case suggests that PEA should be considered in patients with this condition. "

Sporadic cases of S. bovis disease have also been reported in neonates and young infants. Although uncommon, S. bovis infection can cause fulminant neonatal sepsis and meningitis. OBJECTIVES: We report a series of pediatric patients with S. bovis bacteremia in a county hospital in a United States-Mexico border city in order to examine the demographic and clinical associations. METHODS: We characterized the demographic and clinical features in all pediatric patients with blood cultures positive for S. bovis at University Medical Center in El Paso, TX, USA between January 2000 and December 2010. Hospital records were systematically reviewed by using a standardized protocol. RESULTS: A total of seven episodes of S. bovis bacteremia were documented in seven pediatric patients (four female and three male). Mean age was 1.2 days (range 1-3 days), all were Hispanic, average birth weight (3.25 kg). Mode of delivery was spontaneous vaginal delivery (five) and Caesarian section (two). All of our patients developed early (&lt;1 week) onset disease and presented with signs of respiratory distress. Five out of seven babies presented with abdominal distention and diarrhea. Six had clinical evidence of sepsis at presentation. Respiratory distress was the most common manifestation of sepsis (seven). Aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed in two of them. Most patients were treated with a combination of antibiotics (six), either ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin and cefotaxime, and one with ampicillin alone. None of the pediatric patients had endoscopy and none of them died. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus bovis is considered as an uncommon pathogen in the newborn, but can be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated early. Physicians should be alert to the less common presentation of neonatal bacteremia due to S. bovis."

Current guidelines recommended diagnostic work-up for endocarditis among patients with S. gallolyticus bacteremia. However, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, was found to be associated with neonatal sepsis and liver diseases and is less commonly associated with endocarditis compared with S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. Our study aimed to identify the risk factors for S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus endocarditis to help select the patients for echocardiography. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records from all adult patients with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolated from blood cultures at Phramongkutklao Hospital from 2009 to 2015 were reviewed. Patients who had mixed bacteremia or missing records were excluded from the study. Results: During the study period, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was isolated among 106 individuals. Mean age was 66.9+-15.6 years. Most patients (61.3%) were male, with cirrhosis as the most common underlying diseases (46.2%), followed by malignancy and chronic kidney disease. Most common manifestations included primary bacteremia (44.3%), followed by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (23.6%). Infective endocarditis was found among 9 patients. No patients with cirrhosis or single blood specimen of bacteremia had endocarditis (RR 0; p-value 0.003, and RR 1.35; p-value 0.079). The common complications associated with endocarditis were acute respiratory failure (RR 4.32; p-value 0.05), whereas acute kidney injury was a protective factor (RR 0; p-value 0.01). Among 76 patients who had records of 2-year follow-up, no new diagnosis of endocarditis or malignancy was observed. Conclusion: Among patients with S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus bacteremia, echocardiography might not be needed among patients with cirrhosis and without sustained bacteremia."

At the same time, an endocarditis develops and gets worse, with auriculo-ventricular blockade and, especially, major aortic insufficiency, which is the cause of death by a brutal and massive pulmonary oedema. In the progression of an endocarditis, the occurrence of a splenic abscess, primary localisation of the initial septicemia or the secondary of an arterial septic embolism, is a rare contingency compared to the frequency of splenomegaly or splenic infarction: less than 2 percent of the cases in the literature. This very atypical and exceptional case serves as a reminder, on the one hand, of the diagnostic inadequacy of echocardiography which cannot visualise vegetation in the course of progressive endocarditis, and, on the other, of the prognostic importance of auriculoventricular blockade in septal and aortic endocardial lesions."

We diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria that occurred during several months and was caused by Gemella morbillorum and Candida glabrata, respectively. We have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. Staphylococcus oureus, Streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in 70% of the cases. Average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months. We conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. In the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. We suggest that right-sided endocarditis must be considered in any patient with the ""Tricuspid Syndrome,"" consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria. Careful evaluation of prior medical records and clinical course can be very helpful. Echocardiography and serial blood cultures provide the key to diagnosis."

In 135 (69 per cent of the cases) macroscopic nematode infections of the bronchial tract with Pseudalius inflexus and Torynurus convolutus, either singly or in combination, were recorded, and 106 (54 per cent) also had P inflexus within the pulmonary blood vessels. All the macroscopically parasitised porpoises were adults or juveniles although two neonates had histological evidence of nematode infection. There were 62 cases of mild to severe, subacute to chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis, 113 cases of mild to severe chronic granulomatous interstitial pneumonia, and 34 cases of mild to severe vasculitis or thrombovasculitis of pulmonary blood vessels attributable to these nematode infections. In 35 cases necropurulent or purulent (broncho)pneumonias were attributed either to secondary bacterial infections of the lungs or to septicaemias associated in seven cases with Streptococcus canis, in two cases with group B Salmonella species, in one case with Escherichia coli and in one case with Streptococcus lactis. The pulmonary lesions in 67 animals known or diagnosed to have been entrapped in fishing gear were non-specific and included persistent foam in the airways in 45 cases, diffuse congestion in 53, oedema in 50, and multifocal intra-alveolar haemorrhage in 33 cases. Seven cases of acute fibrinous or chronic fibrous pleuritis, seven cases of chronic necropurulent pneumonia associated with mycotic infections, four porpoises with traumatic lesions of the thorax and other parts of the body consistent with fatal attack from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and one case of diffuse bronchointerstitial pneumonia associated with generalised morbillivirus infection were also recorded."

During 1997-2002, Streptococcus canis accounted for 1% of all streptococci isolated. The clinical signs, outcome and bacteriological characteristics were reviewed. All except eight were symptomatic. Clinical manifestations were: soft tissue infection (n=35), bacteremia (n=5), urinary infection (n=3), bone infection (n=2) and pneumonia (n=1). The course was favorable in 52 cases while two died from sepsis. Cultures were often polymicrobial (n=42, 77.8%) apart from hemocultures. The isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics. Presence of the bacteria did not always signify infection owing to the possible occurrence of colonization. The frequency of S. canis infections is rare and likely underestimated owing to the fact that streptococci are sought only on the basis of the Lancefield classification. The search for S. canis is recommended whenever patients present with symptoms evocative of exposure to a potentially contaminated animal."

This group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. We obtained 275 strains of the S. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. The 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. The primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections, 2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. The secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. The S. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. Among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the S. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to CCL and 33% to CTM. ABPC, CPDX, and CFDN were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests. Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. With antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense."

In this study, we evaluated the clinical efficacy and antimicrobial activity of CAM in the empirical treatment of patients with CAP. CAM (200 mg given twice daily for 2 weeks) was orally administered to 26 patients with mild or moderate suspected atypical pneumonia, including 15 patients in whom treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics was largely ineffective. Causative pathogens were identified on the basis of quantitative sputum cultures, blood cultures, and routine serological testings; M. pneumoniae was most commonly observed in patients with CAP (38.5%; 10/26), followed by H. influenzae (11.5%; 3/26), C. pneumoniae (3.8%; 1/26), and S. constellatus (3.8%; 1/26). Penicillin-resistant, or penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from 1 patient (3.8%) and 2 patients (7.7%), respectively out of 26 patients with CAP. There were no detectable pathogens in 8 of 26 patients. The treatment of CAM resulted in complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of pneumonia in all the patients and was not accompanied with any adverse events. The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was not detectable in the patients evaluated. Although it is important to make differential diagnosis of atypical from bacterial pneumonia in designing therapeutic strategy, it is often difficult to make an appropriate diagnosis in patients with CAP. Because of diagnostic difficulties, CAM with a broad antimicrobial spectrum is recommended as the first-line drug for the treatment of lower respiratory infections, particularly in patients with suspected atypical pneumonia."

An investigation was performed to confirm the incidence of ""S. milleri group"" colonization in healthy 120 volunteers' (20 y/o-80 y/o) throats, and it was found that 11.7% (14/120) were positive. On the other hand, attention should be paid to the fact that the ""S. milleri group"" was highly isolated, 24 (24.7%) in 97 purulent respiratory specimens (94 sputa and 3 throat swabs) from which no other significant microorganism was recovered. I have measured the serum antibody titers of the ""S. milleri group"", employing the IFA technique, in 10 patients from whose specimens ""S. milleri group"" was predominantly isolated, and compared with those of 18 healthy volunteers. Whereas all of the titers of healthy volunteers reveal less than 1:256, those of the patients reveal more than 1:512. And antibody titers to ""S. milleri group"" showed the highest in two weeks after ""S. milleri group"" isolation, and came down to healthy adult levels in six weeks or more. Thus far, about half of the causative organisms of acute pneumonia have been reported unknown. In this study I have suggested that the ""S. milleri group"" plays an important role as the causative organism in respiratory infections including pneumonia."

Mild hemiparesis and expressive aphasia indicated an intracranial tumor. INVESTIGATIONS: Cranial computed tomography revealed a focal lesion with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the left frontoparietal lobe, with signs of intracranial hypertension, indicating cerebral metastasis or an abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a brain abscess. TREATMENT AND COURSE: An urgent craniotomy was performed and the abscess was evacuated. An empirical antibiotic combination with chloramphenicole and metronidazole (switched to cefotaxime because of thrombocytopenia) was initiated. Cultivation of pus revealed Streptococcus constellatus, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Fusobacterium spp. Within the first two weeks of treatment progession of the abscess was noted, therefore a second craniotomy with debridement was performed. An elective CT-angio scan revealed several arteriovenous malformations in the caudal segments of both lungs which were embolized without complications. Only retrospectively, cutaneous teleangiectasias were recognized. At present, the patient and her direct relatives are submitted to genetical screening for Osler's disease. CONCLUSION: In patients with brain abscesses of unknown origin and with a history of repeated epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, Osler's disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) should be considered and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations excluded. Physicians should search for cutaneous or mucous teleangiectasias. Family screening and long-term follow-up according to international guidelines is recommended."

The respiratory tract, bone, joint, skin, and soft tissues are well known sites of infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated by biologics or other immunosuppressants. It is known that patients with intra-abdominal infections may develop tuberculous peritonitis during biologic therapy. However, non-tuberculous pelvic peritonitis is rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A case of a 46-year-old patient with RA developed pelvic peritonitis during therapy with MTX, tacrolimus (TAC), and golimumab (GLM). The patient visited our hospital due to a fever and general malaise. Physical findings included lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) images showed an intrauterine foreign body and ascites. The contraceptive ring was removed. Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus constellatus were cultured from the removed contraceptive ring. She was started on an antimicrobial agent, flomoxef (FMOX), at 2 g/day. The FMOX dosage was increased to 3 g/day from the 3rd day of disease and continued for 10 days. Her fever disappeared from the 4th disease day, and her inflammatory response then gradually decreased. No exacerbation of symptoms occurred even after the FMOX treatment was stopped, and the patient was discharged on the 14th disease day. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: MTX and biologics were being administered at the time of onset of peritonitis. The peritonitis was diagnosed on the basis of the gynecological evaluation and CT imaging findings that were typical of peritonitis. The patient was in an immunosuppressed state during administration of anti-rheumatic drugs, and the peritonitis was thought to have developed due to an ascending infection via the long-term presence of the intrauterine contraceptive ring which had an attached string. CONCLUSIONS: Before starting biological agents, patients must be questioned regarding the presence of an intrauterine foreign body."

It is ordinarily difficult to distinguish them from contaminations as the causative pathogens of respiratory infections because they are often cultured in respiratory specimens. Therefore, it is important to understand the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of respiratory infections caused by the SAG members. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of the SAG bacteria in respiratory infections. METHODS: A total of 30 patients who were diagnosed with respiratory infections which were caused by the SAG bacteria between January 2005 and February 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG were mostly seen in male patients with comorbid diseases and were typically complicated with pleural effusion. Pleural effusion was observed in 22 (73.3%) patients. Empyema was observed in half of the 22 patients with pleural effusion. S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus were detected in 16 (53.3 %), 11 (36.7 %) and 3 (10.0 %) patients, respectively. Six patients had mixed-infections. The duration from the onset of symptoms to the hospital visit was significantly longer in ""lung abscess"" patients than in ""pneumonia"" patients among the 24 patients with single infections, but not among the six patients with mixed-infection. The peripheral white blood cell counts of the ""pneumonia"" patients were higher than those of the ""lung abscess"" patients and S. intermedius was identified significantly more frequently in patients with pulmonary and pleural infections (pneumonia and lung abscess) than in patients with bacterial pleurisy only. In addition, the patients in whom S. intermedius was cultured were significantly older than those in whom S. constellatus was cultured. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG bacteria tended to be observed more frequently in male patients with comorbid diseases and to more frequently involve purulent formation. In addition, S. intermedius was mainly identified in elderly patients with having pulmonary infection complicated with pleural effusion, and the aspiration of oral secretions may be a risk factor in the formation of empyema thoracis associated with pneumonia due to S. intermedius."

Recent research suggests they play a role in exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). Owing to poor recovery on standard culture media and difficult differentiation from non-pathogenic streptococci, SMG may be underdiagnosed in routine settings. We aimed to establish the incidence of SMG in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients compared to CF patients and to examine possible links of SMG to exacerbations that plays a key role in progression of COPD. METHODS: Altogether, 90 respiratory tract samples of patients suffering from CF or COPD were examined during the period from July 2012 to December 2013. Semi-selective McKay agar was used for primary cultivation of SMG and MALDI TOF MS was used for species identification that was confirmed by biochemical profiling and specific PCR. RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of SMG in CF (17.6% incidence in adult patients) and newly established its presence in COPD (10.3% incidence). In COPD, SMG was detected in 4 cases of acute exacerbations, where no other bacterial pathogen was detected. In 3/4 cases, increased CRP level indicated bacterial infection as a cause of the exacerbation and in all 3 cases, patients recovered during antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate SMG may act as opportunist pathogens able to cause exacerbations in COPD."

Although several small studies have been reported, the features of SAG pneumonia remain unclear, because the identification of SAG from sputum cultures is not routinely performed in most microbiology laboratories. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics of SAG pneumonia. PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study utilizing data obtained in our hospital between September 2009 and June 2016. We investigated 31 patients with SAG pneumonia (PWP), and also assessed the difference between the 31 PWP and 37 patients without pneumonia (PWOP) in whose sputum SAG was detected. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the patients were men and the median age was 78 years in the PWP. Univariate analysis indicated that the PWP were significantly more often a bed-ridden (p &lt; 0.01) with comorbid aspiration than were the PWOP (p &lt; 0.05). Among the PWP, nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) was the more common type of pneumonia (54.8%). S. anginosus was detected significantly more frequently in sputum cultures of PWP than PWOP (p &lt; 0.01), and multiple pathogens were detected more frequently in PWP (p &lt; 0.01). Streptococcus constellatus was the most frequently detected pathogen in patients with a single bacterial infection. Empyema was observed only in patients with multiple bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: SAG should be recognized as important causative pathogens of pneumonia, particularly among elderly patients with underlying disease associated with aspiration. NHCAP was the more common type of SAG pneumonia in this study."

Here, we describe the case of a 64-year-old male patient, a professional breeder, who attended the Emergency Department with sciatica and back pain that was worsening for a week. The patient had no history of surgery or trauma. The patient had poor oral hygiene. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed lumbar spondylodiscitis, and blood cultures revealed Streptococcus constellatus. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin but due to renal failure deterioration, the treatment was changed to daptomycin for 8 weeks. During hospitalization, he endured renal injury and nosocomial respiratory tract infection. The patient was discharged with no further complications. Follow-up revealed improvement of neurological signs. In our case, it seems that poor oral hygiene was the cause of bacteremia, which underlies the importance of a good oral health status in immunocompromised patients not only to prevent but also to successfully eliminate any dental source of infection. S. constellatus is an extremely rare pathogen and to our knowledge only two other cases of pyogenic spondylodiscitis are reported in the literature.

Imaging to differentiate abscess from other entities is often non-diagnostic, and often the source of infection is unknown. We present an unusual case of peritumoral abscess infected with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: A 70-year-old, previously healthy male presented with a 1-day history of right-sided facial weakness sparing the forehead, as well as concomitant right upper and lower extremity numbness. A homogenously enhancing mass with adjacent rim-enhancing lesion with diffusion restricting cavity seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) raised the possibility of abscess. RESULTS: Separate biopsy specimens of both the tumor and adjacent fluid collection during drainage of the collection confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma and bacterial abscess containing Streptococcus constellatus, Fusobacterium species, Prevotella dentalis, and Parvimonas micra. The histologic diagnosis therefore confirmed the preoperative radiologic findings of two different but associated lesions. Investigations to determine a definitive source of infection were inconclusive, including urinalysis, blood cultures, respiratory cultures, endoscopy, and an orthopantomogram. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can both be culprits in the formation of peritumoral abscess. Although the source of infection is unconfirmed, the presence of oropharyngeal flora in the abscess suggests a subclinical odontogenic infection with hematogenous spread to the tumor and adjacent brain."

Methods: A total of 26 patients diagnosed in Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University from January 2014 to October 2019 were enrolled. The analyzed clinical data included baseline data, clinical symptoms, imaging manifestations, therapies, and outcomes. The microbiological diagnosis was established based on the specimens collected by lung needle biopsy, bronchoscopy, artificial airway aspiration, thoracentesis or thoracoscopy. Results: Among the 26 patients, there were 23 (88.5%) males and 3 (11.5%) females aged (63.0+-12.5) years, and 21 cases (80.8%) had potential diseases. The distribution of clinical manifestations included 21 cases (80.8%) with fever, 13 cases (50.0%) with pectoralgia, 13 cases (50.0%) with cough, and 13 cases (50.0%) with expectoration. Chest CT displayed 18 cases (69.2%) with nodules, 18 cases (69.2%) with pleural effusion, 17 cases (65.4%) with patchy shadows, 12 cases (46.2%) with consolidation, 4 cases (15.4%) with cavity, 3 cases (11.5%) with spontaneous pneumothorax. 13 cases (50.0%) of Streptococcus constellatus, 12 cases (46.2%) of Streptococcus anginosus and 1 case (3.8%) of Streptococcus intermadius were observed through the bacterial culture.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 55-year-old Han Chinese man with underlying diabetes who presented with fever of 17 days duration. A pulmonary computed tomography scan revealed right-sided massive pyopneumothorax. A culture of the pleural effusion and blood grew S. constellatus. A drug sensitivity test showed that the isolate was sensitive to linezolid, penicillin G, cefotaxime, vancomycin, and cefuroxime. Our patient was treated with linezolid for a total of 6 weeks. Subsequently, his chest computed tomography scan showed improved lung condition. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pyopneumothorax secondary to S. constellatus to be treated with linezolid. Pyopneumothorax may be caused by streptococcal infection, and linezolid is another good choice for treatment."

The patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by Streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. The infectious diseases encountered among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. Six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. An underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. Six serum antibody titers for the S. milleri groups were examined in the First Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Ryukyus. Three cases for S. anginosus, two cases for S. intermedius, and one case for S. constellatus showed high titers of X1024 or X2048. Therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the S. milleri group. We also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by S. milleri and S. pneumoniae. There are more underlying diseases in infections caused by S. milleri than in those caused by S. pneumoniae. There were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by S. milleri than among those with S. pneumonia infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

There were predisposing conditions in 47 (38%) patients of which most common were previous surgery (14), trauma (11), malignancy (9) diabetes (6) and immunodeficiency (5). MS were the only bacteria isolated from 12 (10%) patients and mixed infections were encountered in 111, when the number of isolates varied between two and seven (average 3.0) isolates per specimen. The bacteria most commonly isolated with MS were anaerobic cocci (70 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (54), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas (34) and Escherichia coli (26). Most B. fragilis and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections, and those of skin and soft tissue adjacent to the rectum. Most pigmented Prevotella and Fusobacteria were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, head and neck sites. Most MS were recovered from abscesses (43%), the abdominal cavity (17%), sinuses (10%) and chest infections (9%). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients, in 61 this was combined with surgical drainage or correction. Three patients died. These data illustrate that MS can occasionally be associated with infection in children."

An analysis of 18 episodes].ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus milleri group streptococci (SMG). METHODS: Prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. In this study all episodes caused by SMG were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by SMG (0.16/1,000 admissions). The mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. Seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. The most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. Four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. In 13 isolates the identification was at species level (Streptococcus anginosus eight, Streptococcus intermedius four and Streptococcus constellatus one). All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Six patients (33.3%) required surgery. In ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. The infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. The mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SMB bacteremia is uncommon. It involved mainly diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues. The mortality rate was high despite surgery in one third of patients. Patients with advanced age had a poorer prognosis. All isolates investigated were susceptible to penicillin."

A total of 76 strains of viridans streptococci were isolated, of which the most common isolates were Streptococcus constellatus (21 strains), S. intermedius (17), and S. sanguis (10). Species belonging to the S. milleri group accounted for the majority (68%) of isolates. In 38 (53%) patients these organisms were recognized as the sole pathogens. Of the 72 patients, 53 had empyema, 14 had lung abscesses, and five had both empyema and lung abscess. Forty-six (64%) patients had underlying diseases. Of these, malignancies were the most common (17 patients), followed by diabetes mellitus (12 patients) and central nervous system diseases (10 patients). Of the 48 patients who underwent chest-tube drainage, 27 (56%) received further treatments, including intrapleural streptokinase (18 cases), surgery (9), and both intrapleural streptokinase and surgery (3). Two (14%) of the patients with lung abscess alone underwent surgical treatment. Although all viridans streptococcal isolates were susceptible to penicillin, the patients in the study had a high mortality (21%). Univariate and multivariate analysis of data for patients with empyema alone (n = 53) showed a significantly increased risk of death in those with underlying malignancy (OR = 16.0, p = 0.023) and those with non-S. milleri-group isolates (OR = 3.72, p = 0.030). These data imply a strong clinical significance of viridans streptococci in the pathogenesis of empyema and lung abscess, as well as the need for species identification of viridans streptococci in patients with pleuropulmonary diseases."

The heterogeneity of GCS and GGS may obscure the role of certain subtypes, such as the large-colony-forming strains of group C (Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) or group G, in endemic pharyngitis. For a 1-year period, children (aged 6 months to 18 years) (n = 2085) who presented with pharyngitis to the children's hospital emergency department and two outpatient offices were enrolled in a cross-sectional study to ascertain the role of large-colony-forming GCS and GGS in acute pharyngitis. Control patients (n = 194) were children who presented to the same locations during the same time period with non-respiratory tract symptoms or to the orthopaedic cast clinic. Throat cultures were obtained by a standard reference method, and swabs were plated on Strep-Selective Agar. Lancefield grouping and species identification was performed on all beta-haemolytic isolates. In total, 65 (3%) large-colony-forming GCS and GGS strains were obtained from pharyngitis patients, and three (1.5%) were obtained from the control group (odds ratio 2.0; 95% confidence interval 0.6-6.1). The low isolation rate of large-colony-forming strains of GCS and GGS indicates that even if these organisms are associated with acute, sporadic pharyngitis in paediatric patients, they represent an unusual pathogen."

He was transferred from another hospital to the department of intensive care medicine for further diagnosis and treatment. A livid coloured, necrotizing-hemorrhagic swelling of the right lower leg was noted. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory tests revealed an inflammation probably due to bacterial infection, anemia, acute renal failure, acute hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy and lactic acidosis, indicating multi-organ failure and septic shock. No focus of sepsis was found at abdominal sonography and exploratory laparotomy. Chest X-Ray and computed tomography revealed bilateral pneumonia. Doppler ultrasonography of both legs showed acute isolated thrombosis of the right posterior tibial vein. TREATMENT AND COURSE: In addition to a chronic venous ulcer-necrotizing hemorrhagic erysipelas had developed in the right lower leg. A swab taken at surgery and blood cultures grew Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis (group G streptococci, GGS). Despite intensive care treatment and high dosage penicillin G therapy the patient died two days after admission from septic shock and multi-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Group G streptococci cause a variety of common and severe infections. Erysipelas is infrequently associated with GGS but, much more often, with group A streptococci (GAS). This unusual and fulminant case emphasizes the importance of considering Streptococcus dysgalactiae as a causative agent in septicemia with multiple predisposing factors and soft-tissue infections."

Steroid treatment improved her condition, and she received no further medication for approximately three years thereafter. In October 2005, she visited Kurume University Hospital because of cough and fever. Chest X-ray film and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed bilateral patchy consolidation with air-bronchogram sign and ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the right lower lung field, suggesting relapse of organizing pneumonia. However, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed an increase of neutrophils (79%) and the CD4/CD8 ratio (4.04). Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (beta-hemolytic, Lancefield group G) was detected by bacterial culture of the BALF. Treatment with sulbactam sodium/ampicillin sodium (SBT/ ABPC) rapidly improved her symptoms. The patchy consolidations on chest X-ray and HRCT also disappeared after the treatment. On the basis of these clinical and bacteriological findings, we diagnosed the patient as having bacterial pneumonia caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis."

Blood cultures from the recipient and cultures of remnants from the pooled PLT bag grew group C streptococci (GCS). An investigation was conducted to identify both the infection's source and the reasons for the false-negative screening result. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Red blood cell (RBC) units (cocomponent from the eight donations) were traced, quarantined, and cultured. Specimens from the implicated donor were obtained. Isolates were identified and typed by 16S rRNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The blood center screening method was reviewed. RESULTS: beta-Hemolytic GCS, cultured from 1 of 8 RBC units, linked the fatal case to a single donor. The donor's throat swab collected 20 days after donation was positive for the presence of GCS, identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Isolates from the recipient, RBC unit, residual PLTs, and donor's throat swab were indistinguishable by PFGE. The donor denied any symptoms of infection before or after donation. PLT bacterial screening at the blood center was performed using a commercially available bacterial detection system (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux) with a threshold of 15 colony-forming units per bag. CONCLUSION: An asymptomatic donor was implicated as the source of GCS-contaminated PLTs. Current screening methods for PLTs are not sufficient to detect all bacterial contamination. Pooled PLTs are a particular challenge because the small volume of individual units places limits on culturing strategies. Improved detection of bacterial contamination of PLTs is needed."

We aimed to develop and validate protocols for microbiological analysis in post-mortem samples obtained during minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) procedures and to assess their performance. Thirty MIAs performed in adults at Maputo Central Hospital in Southern Mozambique were included in the analysis. Microbiological tests included a universal screening for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, Plasmodium falciparum, and bacterial/fungal culture. In addition, a variety of molecular microbiology assays guided by the histological results were performed in blood, cerebrospinal fluid and a variety of tissue samples including liver, lung and central nervous system. The combination of culture-based methods together with molecular microbiological assays led to the identification of 17 out of 19 (89.5%) of the infectious deaths. Microorganisms identified included Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Cryptococcus neoformans, hepatitis B virus, human herpesvirus 8, cytomegalovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Ryzopus oryzae, and Acinetobacter baumannii.

Observations: An 89-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer on erlotinib presented with corneal perforation due to infectious keratitis. Microbial cultures grew streptococcus dysgalactiae, a virulent pathogen known to affect immunocompromised patients that has not been previously described to cause infectious keratitis. Despite aggressive medical intervention, the clinical course was complicated by rapid progression to no light perception visual acuity in the setting of endophthalmitis with orbital cellulitis, necessitating evisceration. Conclusions and Importance: Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy can result in significant ocular complications including dry eyes, epithelial keratopathy, non-healing abrasions, infectious keratitis, and rarely, corneal melting and perforation. These side effects can predispose patients to aggressive infections with rare organisms, highlighting the importance of understanding the ocular side effects of systemic chemotherapeutic agents."

Methods: This sepsis primary study is part of the larger Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) study, a multicenter, prospective cohort study. We included patients diagnosed with S. pneumoniae and BHS sepsis and examined virulence, defining the high-virulence factor as follows: S. pneumoniae serotype 3, 31, 11A, 35F, and 17F; Streptococcus pyogenes, emm 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, III; and Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis, emm typing pattern stG 6792.

However, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. Many of what we refer to as emerging diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. Thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of Legionella pneumophila infections. New diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. We summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (MDR tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes)."

Clinical variety of endocarditis manifestation is wide and has the potential to mimic vasculitis. Whereas Streptococcus bovis is often isolated and associated with colonic tumors, Neisseriaceae are rarely found. An association of subacute bacterial endocarditis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies has been described. We report on a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with acute oliguric renal failure and a nonpruritic purpural rush without fever. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody diagnostic revealed perinuclear staining with a titre of 1 : 512 and antiproteinase-3 specificity. Immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis without extracapillary proliferation was diagnosed in renal biopsy. Finally, blood cultures became positive for Streptococcus bovis and Neisseria flava. Echocardiography showed mobile vegetations on tricuspid valve. Under treatment with penicillin G and gentamicin, skin efflorescences and renal function recovered, but vegetations increased. A colonic tumor could be excluded, a disastrous dental status may have been a predisposal factor. When classical findings of subacute bacterial endocarditis are less clear, the presence of renal failure and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in absence of fever may lead to misdiagnosis and deleterious immunosuppressive therapy. Neisseria subflava, an upper respiratory tract commensal, may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis without typical symptoms."

Six (26%) of the patients reported in the literature died as a consequence of S. bovis infection. The difference in median age between our patients (14 days; range, 1-43 days) and those reported in the literature (3 days; range, 1-60 days) was not statistically significant (P = 0.49). Abdominal distention was more commonly noted among patients in our series (71%) than among patients reported in the literature (10%; odds ratio = 21.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-319.0). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia and meningitis were the most common manifestations. Gastrointestinal disturbance was common among patients in our series. The mortality rate from S. bovis infection appears to be lower than suggested by previous reports."

Differentiation of Gemella from viridans streptococci in the laboratory may be difficult. Although uncommonly pathogenic, they have been implicated in a variety of human infections, most notably infective endocarditis. Dental instrumentation appears to be the usual source of infection. The case is reported of Gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis, which was associated with an underlying colonic carcinoma. An association with colonic neoplasm has been described in three previous cases of endocarditis attributed to Gemella. It is well documented that Streptococcus bovis endocarditis may occur in the setting of colonic neoplasia. It is suggested that colonic investigation should be considered in patients with Gemella endocarditis, in whom no other source is apparent."

Two cases are presented of neonatal infection by this organism; one case manifested with meningitis and the other, with sepsis. Seizure and respiratory distress were the symptoms found in these two babies, respectively. Following adequate treatment, recovery was complete, and the infants enjoyed healthy lives post-discharge. S. bovis is always sensitive to penicillin, but resistant strain has been reported recently. It is reasonable to treat infant patients infected by this organism with a combined initial therapy of penicillin and aminoglycoside. After the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of antibiotic has been determined, penicillin or ampicillin can be used alone."

Apropos of a case caused by Streptococcus D bovis and faecalis occurring after coloscopy].ABSTRACT:A 59-year-old chronic alcoholic male, with no cardiac past history, was hospitalised with septicemia 5 months after the endoscopic removal of 2 benign intestinal polyps. The diagnosis of tricuspid endocarditis was possible only 2 months later on the basis of echocardiography requested because of the onset of a tricuspid systolic murmur. Blood cultures revealed the presence in succession of streptococcus D fecalis then bovis. Antibiotics, changed several times because of the onset of complications (allergy, agranulocytosis), failed to deal with the problem of infection as shown by the development of several septic pulmonary emboli which finally resulted in total tricuspidectomy with neither immediate nor secondary valve replacement. The authors use this clinical case to review the characteristics of tricuspid endocarditis, the incidence of which is on the increase in certain etiological contexts (staphylococcal endocarditis in drug addicts or secondary to central vascular lines). They stress that the clinical picture is often confusing since the murmur of tricuspid incompetence is absent in 2/3 of cases. Echocardiography must therefore be requested routinely in all septicemias, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and assessment of the risk of pulmonary embolism (risk if vegetation greater than 10 mm). The nature of the organism responsible may be suggestive of certain etiologies. Thus malignant disease of the colon should be sought if the bacterium is a streptococcus D bovis. Apart from antibiotics, treatment must include effective anticoagulation to decrease the risk of embolic recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Recurrent meningitis can occur if the underlying parasitic infection is left untreated. We report five cases of recurrent meningitis related to chronic strongyloidiasis that were associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Common causative organisms are Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, and Klebsiella pneumonia. One patient died during the second episode of meningitis. Three patients showed significant gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms before developing headache and fever. In four cases, patients developed multiple recurrences even with the treatment of thiabendazol.

It shows a wide spectrum of manifestations including severe and recurrent respiratory infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus) and gastrointestinal (Campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and Giardia lamblia). Viral infections caused by herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis C are rare. The opportunistic agents such as CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii, cryptococcus and atypical mycobacteria have been reported as isolated cases. This paper reports the case of a 38-year-old female patient, who began six years before with weight loss of 7 kg in six months, fatigue, weakness, sweating, fever and abdominal pain. Furthermore, patient had intestinal obstruction and abdominal CT showed mesenteric lymph growth. The mesenteric lymph node biopsy revealed positives Mycobacterium PCR, Ziehl-Neelsen staining and culture for M. bovis. In the laparotomy postoperative period was complicated with nosocomial pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Two years later, she developed right renal abscess that required surgical drainage, once again with a positive culture for Mycobacterium bovis. She was referred to highly specialized hospital and we documented panhypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. Secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were ruled out and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) was confirmed, we started IVIG replacement. Four years later she developed mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma. Until today she continues with IVIG and chemotherapy. This report of a patient with CVID and Mycobacterium bovis infection, a unusual association, shows the cellular immunity susceptibility in this immunodeficiency, additional to the humoral defect. "

Sporadic cases of S. bovis disease have also been reported in neonates and young infants. Although uncommon, S. bovis infection can cause fulminant neonatal sepsis and meningitis. OBJECTIVES: We report a series of pediatric patients with S. bovis bacteremia in a county hospital in a United States-Mexico border city in order to examine the demographic and clinical associations. METHODS: We characterized the demographic and clinical features in all pediatric patients with blood cultures positive for S. bovis at University Medical Center in El Paso, TX, USA between January 2000 and December 2010. Hospital records were systematically reviewed by using a standardized protocol. RESULTS: A total of seven episodes of S. bovis bacteremia were documented in seven pediatric patients (four female and three male). Mean age was 1.2 days (range 1-3 days), all were Hispanic, average birth weight (3.25 kg). Mode of delivery was spontaneous vaginal delivery (five) and Caesarian section (two). All of our patients developed early (&lt;1 week) onset disease and presented with signs of respiratory distress. Five out of seven babies presented with abdominal distention and diarrhea. Six had clinical evidence of sepsis at presentation. Respiratory distress was the most common manifestation of sepsis (seven). Aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed in two of them. Most patients were treated with a combination of antibiotics (six), either ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin and cefotaxime, and one with ampicillin alone. None of the pediatric patients had endoscopy and none of them died. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus bovis is considered as an uncommon pathogen in the newborn, but can be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated early. Physicians should be alert to the less common presentation of neonatal bacteremia due to S. bovis."

We diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria that occurred during several months and was caused by Gemella morbillorum and Candida glabrata, respectively. We have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. Staphylococcus oureus, Streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in 70% of the cases. Average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months. We conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. In the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. We suggest that right-sided endocarditis must be considered in any patient with the ""Tricuspid Syndrome,"" consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria.

AIMS: In this study, we have analysed whether Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia is associated with an increased risk of hepatobiliary and colonic pathology. The association with other pathologies and the antibiotic sensitivities of Streptococcus gallolyticus were also analysed. DESIGN: Observational retrospective study. METHODS: The case notes of patients with documented Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia between 2007 and 2012 at Mater Dei hospital (Malta) were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data, including co-morbidities, clinical investigations, antibiotic sensitivities and mortality were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients (33 males, 9 females) were recruited. Two patients were pre-term infants and were therefore excluded from the study. Mean age of the cohort population studied was 72 years (SD +- 14). One-year survival rate was 62%. Gastrointestinal (colonic and hepatobiliary-pancreatic) pathologies were present in 59.5% of patients with 16% of this group having more than one gastrointestinal pathology. High incidence rates of underlying diabetes mellitus (28.6%), valvular heart disease (21.4%) and malignancies (21.4%) were noted in this study. Furthermore, we observed that 14.3% of patients had an underlying respiratory pathology. Streptococcus gallolyticus was 100% sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin but was highly resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia is commoner in the elderly and in those with multiple underlying co-morbidities. The high incidence of gastrointestinal pathologies among patients with Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteraemia (59.5%) suggests that a thorough work-up for colonic and hepatobiliary/pancreatic pathology should be carried out in these patients."

Neonatal S. pasteurianus infection typically presents as meningitis. This case report describes the first neonatal case of S. pasteurianus endocarditis in the literature, in addition to a neonatal case of S. pasteurianus infection presenting as pneumonitis without meningitis. The S. pasteurianus infections in these two cases are unusual not only because of how rare this particular pathogen is, but also because of the atypical clinical manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient is a full-term male infant admitted to NICU at 20 h of life due to respiratory distress. He was empirically started on ampicillin and gentamicin for presumed sepsis. Laboratory analysis of cerebral spinal fluid obtained after initiation of antibiotics was suggestive of partially treated meningitis. Blood cultures came back positive for S. pasteurianus. The neonate was transitioned from ampicillin to cefepime, while gentamicin was continued. Echocardiograph showed a possible tricuspid valve vegetation concerning for endocarditis. Due to the unusual complication of endocarditis, the patient remained on IV cefepime for 28 days rather than the more conventional duration of 14-21 days reported in the literature. The baby clinically improved with no evidence of thrombi or vegetations on repeat cardiac echo. The second patient is a full-term male infant who required intubation at birth for respiratory distress. Chest X-ray findings were concerning for meconium aspiration with pneumonitis. The baby went into septic shock and was empirically started on ampicillin and gentamicin. Blood cultures came back positive for S. pasteurianus, while cerebral spinal fluid and urine cultures were negative. Ampicillin and gentamicin were discontinued after 3 days and the baby was started on cefepime and clindamycin for a total 14-day course. The baby clinically recovered and was discharged from NICU without any sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases highlight the importance of recognizing S. pasteurianus as a potential cause of neonatal sepsis and the importance of recognizing endocarditis and pneumonitis as possible clinical manifestations of this infection."

The disease course is generally fulminant and rarely presents initially as a purpura over the plantar region. We present a case of a 54-year-old female hospital worker diagnosed with viridians streptococcal shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus gordonii. Despite aggressive antibiotic treatment, fluid hydration, and use of inotropes and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the patient succumbed to the disease. Early diagnosis of the potentially fatal disease followed by a prompt antibiotic regimen and appropriate use of steroids are cornerstones in the management of this disease to reduce the risk of high morbidity and mortality.

PURPOSE: We describe 2 patients who presented with new-onset, severe back pain; blood cultures revealed S. gordonii bacteremia, which led to the diagnosis of spondylodiskitis and IE. We review our 2-decade experience with S. gordonii bacteremia to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients. RESULTS: In our hospital over the last 20 years (1998-2017), a total of 15 patients with S. gordonii bacteremia were diagnosed, including 11 men and 4 women, and the mean age was 65 +- 22 (range 23-95). The most common diagnosis was IE (9 patients), spondylodiskitis (the presented 2 patients, who in addition were diagnosed with endocarditis), necrotizing fasciitis (1), sternitis (1), septic arthritis (1) and pneumonia (1). The 11 patients with IE were treated with penicillin +- gentamicin, or ceftriaxone for 6 weeks, 5 required valve surgery and 10/11 (91%) attained complete cure. The 2 patients with diskitis required 2-3 months of intravenous antibiotics to achieve complete cure. CONCLUSION: Spondylodiskitis was the presenting symptom of 2/11 (18%) patients with S. gordonii endocarditis. Spondylodiskitis should probably be looked for in patients diagnosed with S. gordonii endocarditis and back pain as duration of antibiotic treatment to achieve complete cure may be considerably longer."

It is usually caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Methods: A young Romanian male presented with fever and rigors, mild tachypnea, hypoxia, sore throat, decayed teeth, and tenderness of the left carotid triangle. Laboratory examination indicated severe sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome while the Doppler ultrasonography of the carotids revealed left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The patient was administered piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin intravenously, doxycycline orally, and anti-coagulation by enoxaparin based on the diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome. Meanwhile, he was complicated by bilateral diffuse pulmonary cavities and encapsulated pleural effusions and so transcutaneous drainage was performed. The patient was discharged after a month and continued his treatment with oral phenoxypenicillin and doxycycline until full radiographic improvement. He was switched to oral anti-coagulation by vitamin-K antagonists and was referred to a hematologist, a vascular-surgeon, and a dentist. Results: Streptococcus gordonii was isolated from the patient's blood and pleural fluid cultures and serology for Rickettsial spp. IgM was positive. Thrombophilia genetic tests revealed three minor mutations for fibrinogen-455, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. According to the literature, S. gordonii is not usually a causative agent and Rickettsial spp. have as yet not been correlated with Lemierre syndrome. The failure of left jugular vein recanalization shows a possible causative role of the underlying thrombophilic predisposition. Discussion: Because of the syndrome's rarity and the atypical microorganisms isolated in this case, increased awareness is advised for its diagnosis and the underlying mechanisms involved in its genesis. The role of anti-coagulation is debatable. LEARNING POINTS: Very rare condition. Medical practitioners should be vigilant in its diagnosis since septic jugular vein thrombophlebitis could be misdiagnosed as neck lymphadenitis.Duration of antibiotic therapy and additional anticoagulation treatment are still under discussion.Underlying thrombophilia predisposition should be excluded."

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (&gt; or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p &lt;.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity."

Hepatopulmonary syndrome was diagnosed after demonstration of the presence of a massive intrapulmonary shunt. Although the anomalous vascular channel never was defined anatomically, follow-up studies confirmed the presence of a functional shunt. Culture of a sample from the abscess yielded Streptococcus intermedius. It was hypothesized that the patient's pulmonary vascular pathology was due, in large part, to chronic elevated levels of nitric oxide (a potent vasodilator thought to be generated by endotoxin absorbed from the gut). Treatment with oral norfloxacin was initiated on the basis of data that this antibiotic reduces endotoxemia and concomitant nitric oxide production in patients with cirrhosis.

STUDY DESIGN: A 21-year-old man presented with a scalp swelling and epidural abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scans revealed unilateral opacification of the frontal sinus and an epidural abscess with a direct connection to the scalp abscess. Further history revealed that his symptoms occurred coincidentally with a tooth extraction 2 months before, and he was hospitalized soon after the tooth extraction for sepsis and a lung abscess. METHODS: A combined neurosurgical and otolaryngologic approach was required to treat the sinusitis and the associated epidural and scalp abscess. RESULTS: Cultures returned as Streptococcus intermedius from all three sites. The patient was free of disease at the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Odontogenic maxillary sinusitis is well documented; however, there is little reported of frontal sinusitis arising from dental disease. The prevalence of sinusitis of dental origin will be reviewed, including the microbiology of this particularly virulent organism that persisted despite earlier treatment with ampicillin. Also, the current thoughts on management of these cases will be discussed with particular reference to local therapy for sinusitis in addition to systemic treatment with antibiotics."

This group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. We obtained 275 strains of the S. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. The 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. The primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections, 2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. The secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. The S. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. Among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the S. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to CCL and 33% to CTM. ABPC, CPDX, and CFDN were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests. Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. With antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense."

CASE SUMMARY: An 85-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart failure, and hypothyroidism developed empyema as a result of 2 episodes of CAP and an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis within the past 2 months. Therapy with intravenous levofloxacin 750 mg every 48 hours was initiated. Culture results of the empyema fluid yielded pure growth of a rarely encountered microorganism, S. intermedius. Intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g every 6 hours was added to the antimicrobial therapy at that time. However, cultures continued to show S. intermedius. Surgical decortication was unsuccessful, and the patient died after a 30 day hospital stay. DISCUSSION: Early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of CAP treatment. Although rare, empyema or thoracic abscess can occur despite this therapy, due to mucosal changes caused by CAP. Historically, antimicrobial therapy used to treat organisms that typically cause CAP also has activity against S. intermedius. However, growth of this microorganism and failure to respond to therapy should alert clinicians to the possibility of empyema or abscess formation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite historical in vitro susceptibility data of S. intermedius, antimicrobial therapy may be ineffective, and more extreme measures may be needed to achieve a successful outcome. Early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy needs to remain the mainstay of the treatment of CAP in an attempt to prevent fatal complications such as this from occurring."

Haemophilus parainfluenzae is usually categorized as one of the normal flora which colonizes in the ears and the nasopharynx, and it has been long considered that H. parainfluenzae has little pathogenicity in the lower respiratory tract and lung parenchymal. In this report, we present a case of pulmonary abscess caused by both H. parainfluenzae and Streptococcus intermedius. The patient was a 75-year-old man who had had total esophageo-gastrectomy because of esophageal cancer. He presented with purulent sputum, and chest X-ray film showed a dense consolidation in the right upper lung field. CT-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration was performed as a diagnostic procedure. Since both H. parainfluenzae and S. intermedius had been isolated from the lesion, pulmonary abscess caused by these two pathogens was diagnosed. The patient was treated with panipenem/betamipron, and his symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray film improved thereafter. So far, very few cases have been reported in which H. parainfluenzae caused lower respiratory tract infection. Although S. intermedius is known as one of the pathogens of pulmonary abscess, it is possible that H. parainfluenzae could also be pathogenic in infectious diseases of the lung."

CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of headache for 2 months before acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever. CT-scan and MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion. A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved. CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after coil embolization. He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A second embolization was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. DISCUSSION: We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. CONCLUSION: Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke."

After a bout of respiratory tract infection, she was diagnosed to have bacterial endocarditis associated with mitral valve disease. The causative agents isolated included Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides bivius. At the same time, the patient was found to have developed IgA immunodeficiency. A complication accompanying the cardiac disease was spontaneous pneumothorax. Since antibiotic therapy had failed, the mitral valve was replaced by a prosthetic one. After the procedure, the patient had her teeth examined. The examination revealed complete destruction of tooth 36, thick layers of calculus and chronic gingivitis. E. corrodens was isolated also after microbiological examination of the patient's oral cavity. The reason for reporting on what we regard as an interesting case is that bacterial endocarditis with E. corrodens implicated as the causative agent is relatively rare; to date, polymicrobial endocarditis due to E. corrodens and other microorganisms has been described in intravenous drug addicts only."

PCR/ESI-MS detected Streptococcus intermedius, a common cause of brain abscesses, in both CSF samples as well as in the fixed tissue from the biopsy. This unique case confirms S. intermedius pulmonary infection as the source of metastatic CNS infection and reveals the potential of PCR/ESI-MS to detect a streptococcal pathogen not captured by conventional cultures."

Combinations of fever, pharyngitis, dysphagia, odynophagia, or oropharyngeal swelling are common presenting symptoms. Infection of the lateral pharyngeal space may result in thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, subsequent metastatic complications (e.g., lung abscesses, septic arthritis), and significant morbidity and mortality. LS is usually caused by the gram-negative anaerobic bacillus Fusobacterium necrophorum, hence also known as necrobacillosis. We present a case of LS caused by Streptococcus intermedius, likely secondary to gingival scraping, in which the presenting complaint was neck pain. The oropharyngeal examination was normal and an initial CT of the neck was done without contrast, which likely resulted in a diagnostic delay. This syndrome can be easily missed in early phases. However, given the potential severity of LS, early recognition and expedient appropriate antimicrobial treatment are critical. S. intermedius is an unusual cause of LS, with only 2 previous cases being reported in the literature. Therefore, an awareness of the myriad presentations of this syndrome, which in turn will lead to appropriate and timely diagnostic studies, will result in improved outcome for LS."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus intermediusID:26502716TITLE:The clinical features of respiratory infections caused by the Streptococcus anginosus group.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) play important roles in respiratory infections. It is ordinarily difficult to distinguish them from contaminations as the causative pathogens of respiratory infections because they are often cultured in respiratory specimens. Therefore, it is important to understand the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of respiratory infections caused by the SAG members. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of the SAG bacteria in respiratory infections. METHODS: A total of 30 patients who were diagnosed with respiratory infections which were caused by the SAG bacteria between January 2005 and February 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG were mostly seen in male patients with comorbid diseases and were typically complicated with pleural effusion. Pleural effusion was observed in 22 (73.3%) patients. Empyema was observed in half of the 22 patients with pleural effusion. S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus were detected in 16 (53.3 %), 11 (36.7 %) and 3 (10.0 %) patients, respectively. Six patients had mixed-infections. The duration from the onset of symptoms to the hospital visit was significantly longer in ""lung abscess"" patients than in ""pneumonia"" patients among the 24 patients with single infections, but not among the six patients with mixed-infection. The peripheral white blood cell counts of the ""pneumonia"" patients were higher than those of the ""lung abscess"" patients and S. intermedius was identified significantly more frequently in patients with pulmonary and pleural infections (pneumonia and lung abscess) than in patients with bacterial pleurisy only. In addition, the patients in whom S. intermedius was cultured were significantly older than those in whom S. constellatus was cultured. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG bacteria tended to be observed more frequently in male patients with comorbid diseases and to more frequently involve purulent formation. In addition, S. intermedius was mainly identified in elderly patients with having pulmonary infection complicated with pleural effusion, and the aspiration of oral secretions may be a risk factor in the formation of empyema thoracis associated with pneumonia due to S. intermedius."

Recent research suggests they play a role in exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). Owing to poor recovery on standard culture media and difficult differentiation from non-pathogenic streptococci, SMG may be underdiagnosed in routine settings. We aimed to establish the incidence of SMG in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients compared to CF patients and to examine possible links of SMG to exacerbations that plays a key role in progression of COPD. METHODS: Altogether, 90 respiratory tract samples of patients suffering from CF or COPD were examined during the period from July 2012 to December 2013. Semi-selective McKay agar was used for primary cultivation of SMG and MALDI TOF MS was used for species identification that was confirmed by biochemical profiling and specific PCR. RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of SMG in CF (17.6% incidence in adult patients) and newly established its presence in COPD (10.3% incidence). In COPD, SMG was detected in 4 cases of acute exacerbations, where no other bacterial pathogen was detected. In 3/4 cases, increased CRP level indicated bacterial infection as a cause of the exacerbation and in all 3 cases, patients recovered during antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate SMG may act as opportunist pathogens able to cause exacerbations in COPD."

Although several small studies have been reported, the features of SAG pneumonia remain unclear, because the identification of SAG from sputum cultures is not routinely performed in most microbiology laboratories. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics of SAG pneumonia. PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study utilizing data obtained in our hospital between September 2009 and June 2016. We investigated 31 patients with SAG pneumonia (PWP), and also assessed the difference between the 31 PWP and 37 patients without pneumonia (PWOP) in whose sputum SAG was detected. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the patients were men and the median age was 78 years in the PWP. Univariate analysis indicated that the PWP were significantly more often a bed-ridden (p &lt; 0.01) with comorbid aspiration than were the PWOP (p &lt; 0.05). Among the PWP, nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) was the more common type of pneumonia (54.8%). S. anginosus was detected significantly more frequently in sputum cultures of PWP than PWOP (p &lt; 0.01), and multiple pathogens were detected more frequently in PWP (p &lt; 0.01). Streptococcus constellatus was the most frequently detected pathogen in patients with a single bacterial infection. Empyema was observed only in patients with multiple bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: SAG should be recognized as important causative pathogens of pneumonia, particularly among elderly patients with underlying disease associated with aspiration. NHCAP was the more common type of SAG pneumonia in this study."

Our patient presented with respiratory failure and required hospitalization and treatment in the intensive care unit. Moreover, she required surgical drainage of right lung empyema as well as decortication and resection. The review of literature revealed three cases of S. intermedius pneumonia, one of which was a mortality. Comparison of the published cases showed a highly varied prehospital course and radiological presentations, with a symptomatic phase ranging from 10 days to five months. Radiological findings varied from an isolated pleural effusion to systemic disease with the presence of brain abscesses. Immunocompetence appears to correlate well with the overall prognosis. In addition, smoking appears to be an important risk factor for S. intermedius pneumonia. In 2 (50%) of cases, pleural fluid analysis identified S. intermedius. In contrast, no organism was found in our patient, necessitating the acquisition of lung tissue sample for the diagnosis. In conclusion, both medical and surgical management are necessary for effective treatment of S. intermedius pneumonia. The outcome of treatment is good in immunocompetent individuals."

Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs), characterized by abnormal direct communication between pulmonary artery and vein, are a rare underlying cause of brain abscesses.

Aiding by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample which identified S. intermedius as the causative pathogen, the patient was switched to the single therapy of large dose of penicillin G and was cured precisely and economically. CONCLUSIONS: It is an alternative way to perform mNGS to identify causative pathogens in patients with brain abscesses especially when the results of traditional bacterial culture were negative.

The patient presented with meningeal signs, severe paraplegia, sensory impairment with a sensory level, and urinary retention. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study showed pleocytosis with polymorphonuclear cells and a decreased glucose level suggesting bacterial meningitis.

The patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by Streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. The infectious diseases encountered among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. Six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. An underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. Six serum antibody titers for the S. milleri groups were examined in the First Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Ryukyus. Three cases for S. anginosus, two cases for S. intermedius, and one case for S. constellatus showed high titers of X1024 or X2048. Therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the S. milleri group. We also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by S. milleri and S. pneumoniae. There are more underlying diseases in infections caused by S. milleri than in those caused by S. pneumoniae. There were more smokers among the patients with infections caused by S. milleri than among those with S. pneumonia infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

There were predisposing conditions in 47 (38%) patients of which most common were previous surgery (14), trauma (11), malignancy (9) diabetes (6) and immunodeficiency (5). MS were the only bacteria isolated from 12 (10%) patients and mixed infections were encountered in 111, when the number of isolates varied between two and seven (average 3.0) isolates per specimen. The bacteria most commonly isolated with MS were anaerobic cocci (70 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (54), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas (34) and Escherichia coli (26). Most B. fragilis and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections, and those of skin and soft tissue adjacent to the rectum. Most pigmented Prevotella and Fusobacteria were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, head and neck sites. Most MS were recovered from abscesses (43%), the abdominal cavity (17%), sinuses (10%) and chest infections (9%). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients, in 61 this was combined with surgical drainage or correction. Three patients died.

He had mild periodontal disease and his chest radiographs and chest computed tomographic (CT) scans showed multiple pulmonary nodules. The CT scan strongly suggested septic pulmonary embolism. Aspirated pus from one of the nodules yielded pure growth of Streptococcus intermedius. Lesions resolved with antimicrobial therapy. The usual predisposing factors for septic pulmonary embolism were absent, and, the isolation of S intermedius from the pus, the antecedent toothache, and periodontal disease all suggested the gingiva as the source. We hypothesize that periodontal infection led to bacteremia, seeding of the lungs, and multiple anaerobic pulmonary abscesses, akin to reported instances of infective endocarditis from dental foci without any prior dental procedures. To our knowledge, this presentation of septic pulmonary embolism is unprecedented."

An analysis of 18 episodes].ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus milleri group streptococci (SMG). METHODS: Prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. In this study all episodes caused by SMG were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by SMG (0.16/1,000 admissions). The mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. Seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. The most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. Four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. In 13 isolates the identification was at species level (Streptococcus anginosus eight, Streptococcus intermedius four and Streptococcus constellatus one). All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Six patients (33.3%) required surgery. In ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. The infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. The mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SMB bacteremia is uncommon. It involved mainly diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues. The mortality rate was high despite surgery in one third of patients. Patients with advanced age had a poorer prognosis. All isolates investigated were susceptible to penicillin."

A total of 76 strains of viridans streptococci were isolated, of which the most common isolates were Streptococcus constellatus (21 strains), S. intermedius (17), and S. sanguis (10). Species belonging to the S. milleri group accounted for the majority (68%) of isolates. In 38 (53%) patients these organisms were recognized as the sole pathogens. Of the 72 patients, 53 had empyema, 14 had lung abscesses, and five had both empyema and lung abscess. Forty-six (64%) patients had underlying diseases. Of these, malignancies were the most common (17 patients), followed by diabetes mellitus (12 patients) and central nervous system diseases (10 patients). Of the 48 patients who underwent chest-tube drainage, 27 (56%) received further treatments, including intrapleural streptokinase (18 cases), surgery (9), and both intrapleural streptokinase and surgery (3). Two (14%) of the patients with lung abscess alone underwent surgical treatment. Although all viridans streptococcal isolates were susceptible to penicillin, the patients in the study had a high mortality (21%). Univariate and multivariate analysis of data for patients with empyema alone (n = 53) showed a significantly increased risk of death in those with underlying malignancy (OR = 16.0, p = 0.023) and those with non-S. milleri-group isolates (OR = 3.72, p = 0.030). These data imply a strong clinical significance of viridans streptococci in the pathogenesis of empyema and lung abscess, as well as the need for species identification of viridans streptococci in patients with pleuropulmonary diseases."

Diabetus mellitus and periodontal diseases were prominent underlying diseases in patients with lung abscess. Cough was complained in 13 patients, chest or back pain in 9, purulent sputum in 8 and hemosputum in 5 when the patients admitted to our hospital. A temperature higher than 38 degrees C was present in 12 patients but temperature les than 37 degrees C in 2. Multiple microorganisms were cultured from TTA in 15 patients. A mean of 2.7 bacterial species per patient was isolated, aerobes alone being isolated in 2 patients, anaerobes alone in 3, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates in 10. Seventeen strains of aerobes and 35 of anaerobes were isolated. Major pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus intermedius and other in aerobes, and Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica and others in anaerobes. Abnormality of chest X-ray was located on the right upper lobe in 6 patients, the right lower lobe in 6, the left upper lobe in 6, the left lower lobe in 4 and the right middle lobe in 1.

It was only after surgical and digital opening, drainage of pus pockets and daily pleural lavage that the clinical picture improved. The microorganisms cultured from both patients included Streptococcus milleri, probably acquired by aspiration. Thoracic empyema as a complication of pneumonia is clinically recognised by lack of response to antimicrobial agents. For the diagnosis, ultrasonographic and CT imaging, followed by pleural puncture are used. Simple parapneumonic effusions are managed by drainage with or without rinsing with normal saline, while in advanced empyema, instillations with fibrinolytic agents have proved safe and effective.

All patients admitted with a diagnosis of thoracic empyema in the Auckland region between 1993 and 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were determined at 3-6 month follow up. Radiological outcomes were scored on admission, discharge and follow up by blinded chest radiograph review based on lung field opacification, extent and thickness of pleura. Forty-six cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. Mean age was 56 +/- 21 years, 67% were male and there was no ethnic preponderance. Forty-six per cent of cases had specific underlying risk factors. Multi-loculated cases of empyema occurred in 63%, pleural aspirate was culture positive in 59% and Streptococcus milleri represented 42% of all positive cultures. Delay in appropriate management was 5.2 +/- 4.2 days. Fifty-six per cent of total procedures incorporated intrapleural streptokinase as an adjunct to drainage. The cure rate was 93.3% without requirement for surgical intervention. Two patients died early giving a 4.3% mortality rate. Radiological scores were 8.6 +/- 0.6 on admission, 6.3 +/- 1.5 on discharge and 2.5 +/- 2.5 at follow up. Improvement in radiological scores was statistically significant from admission to discharge and follow up (P &lt; 0.001). The total duration of hospitalization was 22 +/- 10 days and by univariate analysis was predicted by: pleural sepsis not involving S. milleri (P = 0.001), specific predisposing factors (P = 0.02), and frank pus on pleural aspiration (P = 0.03). Total delay in management was suggestive in prolonging the duration of hospitalization (P = 0.07). Parapneumonic thoracic empyema is an important source of morbidity which is determined by both patient and management factors. Good results can be obtained by prompt medical therapy including tube drainage and intrapleural streptokinase without need for surgical intervention."

Although debate persists about their sensitivity, most investigators consider ADTs to be highly specific. Nevertheless, reports continue to describe false-positive ADT results (positive ADT result, negative culture result). This study examined culture results from 522 adult patients with acute pharyngitis and a positive ADT result; unexpectedly, 15% had throat culture results negative for GAS. Normal bacterial flora from 30% of these ""negative"" culture results produced a positive ADT result. An ADT-reactive organism belonging to the Streptococcus milleri group was isolated from 1 culture; it carried group A carbohydrate antigen. Although S. milleri previously has been associated with false-positive ADT reactions, the frequency of this phenomenon is unknown. The present, large study suggests that false-positive ADT reactions may be more common than previously reported, an observation that must be precisely explained and epidemiologically and clinically defined."

This study was conducted to investigate the bacteriology of community-acquired lung abscess and to improve the empirical therapeutic strategy for adults with community-acquired lung abscess. METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed data on 90 consecutive adult cases of bacteriologically confirmed community-acquired lung abscess treated during 1995-2003 at a tertiary university hospital in Taiwan. RESULTS: We found that a high proportion (21%) of cases of lung abscess were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, which differs from the findings of previous studies. Lung abscess due to K. pneumoniae was associated with underlying diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-18.4; P = .039) and negatively correlated with a time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of &gt;30 days (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P = .008). A higher percentage of patients with K. pneumoniae lung abscess had concomitant bacteremia (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.1-81.9; P = .032), delayed defervesence (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.8-47.8; P = .004), and multiple cavities noted on radiographs (OR, 11.0; 95% CI, 1.3-94.9; P = .015), compared with patients with anaerobic bacterial lung abscess. The rate of nonsusceptibility to clindamycin and penicillin among anaerobes and Streptococcus milleri group isolates increased. CONCLUSION: K. pneumoniae has become a more common cause of lung abscess than before, and a high proportion of anaerobes and S. milleri strains have become resistant to penicillin and clindamycin. A beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or second- or third-generation cephalosporin with clindamycin or metronidazole is suggested as empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired lung abscess."

CT-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration was performed as a diagnostic procedure. Since both H. parainfluenzae and S. intermedius had been isolated from the lesion, pulmonary abscess caused by these two pathogens was diagnosed. The patient was treated with panipenem/betamipron, and his symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray film improved thereafter. So far, very few cases have been reported in which H. parainfluenzae caused lower respiratory tract infection. Although S. intermedius is known as one of the pathogens of pulmonary abscess, it is possible that H. parainfluenzae could also be pathogenic in infectious diseases of the lung."

METHODS: A prospective population-based study of 3675 patients with a diagnosis of CAP was carried out. Patients were classified as ""definite empyema"" based on one or more of the following criteria: presence of microorganisms in pleural fluid Gram stain or culture, pleural pH less than 7.2 associated with radiographic features of empyema, or frank pus in the pleural space at the time of thoroscopy. All others were classified as either ""suspected empyema"" or CAP. We then compared characteristics and outcomes between subgroups. RESULTS: A diagnosis of empyema was made in 47 patients (1.3%) by the attending physician; 24 patients (0.7%) met criteria for definite cases. Few clinical, laboratory, or radiographic features were useful in differentiating patients with definite empyema. The most commonly isolated pathogen from pleural fluid of patients with definite empyema was Streptococcus milleri group (50%). The in-hospital mortality rate for patients with definite empyema was 4.2%. CONCLUSION: In the 21st century, empyema is an uncommon complication of CAP with an incidence of 0.7%. The S. milleri group has emerged as the most common causative microbial pathogen. The diagnosis remains difficult, although outcomes have improved from that previously reported."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus milleriID:17161100TITLE:Streptococcus milleri infections of the pleural space: operative management predominates.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Management of patients with thoracic empyema ranges from tube thoracostomy drainage, with or without fibrinolytics, to operative intervention, with the optimal intervention remaining uncertain. Streptococcus milleri, typically a benign bacterium colonizing the oropharynx, has recently been reported as a potential pathogen in pneumonia and pleural space disease. Our initial experience indicated this infection, when in the pleural space, was particularly tenacious and often required major operative intervention to eradicate. Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with S milleri pleural space infections often require operative intervention as definitive treatment. METHODS: We reviewed all patients from June 17, 1999 to April 15, 2005 with S milleri infections at our level I academic trauma/acute care surgery department at a safety-net hospital. S milleri infections were diagnosed by thoracentesis, bronchoalveolar lavage, tube thoracostomy fluid, or intraoperative culture. RESULTS: Over the 70-month period evaluated, of 697 patients with S milleri infections, 39 patients had S milleri infections of the pleural space; 26 (67%) patients underwent operative intervention. The majority (72%) were men with a mean age of 46 (range 22 to 63); the underlying etiology in those patients requiring operation was pneumonia (26 patients; 67%), trauma (9 patients; 23%), postoperative infection (2 patients), foreign body ingestion (1 patient), and malignancy (1 patient). The vast majority of patients in the operative group were treated preoperatively with tube thoracostomy (88%) and antibiotics (96%). The average duration of chest tube drainage prior to operation was 4.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6 to 6.2) and antibiotic treatment was 6.0 days (95% CI 3.8 to 8.2). Thirteen patients (50%) underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and 13 patients required thoracotomy. VATS was performed more often when operative intervention occurred early (average hospital day 6.2) compared to initial thoracotomy or conversion from VATS to thoracotomy (average hospital day 9.8). Hospital length of stay was less in the operative group (average 24 days; 95% CI 17 to 31) than in the nonoperative group (34 days; 95% CI 19 to 49), discharge to home was greater in the operative group (77% vs. 16%), and mortality was less in operative group (0% vs. 23%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite attempts at nonoperative management, the majority of patients with a S milleri pleural space infection require operative intervention for definitive therapy. Patients diagnosed with S milleri empyema should be considered for early operative intervention due to the unrelenting nature of their infection. Operative treatment is associated with a shorter hospital length of stay, increased discharge to home, and decreased mortality."

Though not included in the approved lists of bacterial names, ""S. milleri group"" are regarded as the causative organisms of suppurative infections, such as oral abscess, brain abscess, lung abscess and empyema. I have studied the clinical significance of the ""S. milleri group"" in respiratory infections. An investigation was performed to confirm the incidence of ""S. milleri group"" colonization in healthy 120 volunteers' (20 y/o-80 y/o) throats, and it was found that 11.7% (14/120) were positive. On the other hand, attention should be paid to the fact that the ""S. milleri group"" was highly isolated, 24 (24.7%) in 97 purulent respiratory specimens (94 sputa and 3 throat swabs) from which no other significant microorganism was recovered. I have measured the serum antibody titers of the ""S. milleri group"", employing the IFA technique, in 10 patients from whose specimens ""S. milleri group"" was predominantly isolated, and compared with those of 18 healthy volunteers. Whereas all of the titers of healthy volunteers reveal less than 1:256, those of the patients reveal more than 1:512. And antibody titers to ""S. milleri group"" showed the highest in two weeks after ""S. milleri group"" isolation, and came down to healthy adult levels in six weeks or more. Thus far, about half of the causative organisms of acute pneumonia have been reported unknown. In this study I have suggested that the ""S. milleri group"" plays an important role as the causative organism in respiratory infections including pneumonia."

However, SMG disease has rarely been identified in cystic fibrosis (CF). Inherent difficulties in both growing the organisms and distinguishing SMG from less virulent oropharyngeal viridans streptococci may have led to a decreased recognition of this as a CF pathogen. We report on six cases of SMG-related infection over a 4-year time-frame occurring within an adult CF clinic in Canada, and a further four cases identified through a literature review. SMG manifested disease as bronchopulmonary exacerbations in 7 of 10 patients, and 4 of 10 patients had extra-pulmonary dissemination of SMG infection. Noticeably, pulmonary exacerbations were frequently associated with atypically malodorous sputum. Furthermore, patients clinically responded to anti-microbial therapies with no anti-Pseudomonal activity. There was a consistent correlation of SMG disease and co-colonization with P. aeruginosa leading to speculation of polymicrobial interactions resulting in enhanced virulence. SMG deserves considerable attention as a potential pathogen within the airways of patients with CF."

DESIGN: Examination of medical records on diabetic inpatients between January 1984 and December 1986. SETTING: Alice Springs Hospital in central Australia, covering an Aboriginal population of about 12,500 people. PATIENTS: Subjects admitted with a bacterial infection (n = 165) were selected from the database of all Aboriginal people known to have diabetes in the region (n = 374; all had non-insulin dependent diabetes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of admissions, type and site of infections, causative organisms, duration of hospital stay and cause of death. RESULTS: The 281 admissions for infections accounted for 4.6% of adult Aboriginal admissions to hospital. Thirteen patients died. Eleven patients required amputation of a digit or limb. In 1986, 13/200 patients admitted with diabetes had bacteraemia compared with 14/1885 patients who did not have diabetes. One patient had Fournier's gangrene, one had malignant otitis externa, one community acquired Acinetobacter pneumonia, one pneumonia with Succinivibrio spp. found in blood cultures, and one meningitis and transverse myelopathy with Streptococcus milleri found in blood cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, type and severity of infections in the relatively young patients result in high personal costs to the community and financial costs to the health care system. Standard preventive measures must be implemented to control severe bacterial infections among subjects with diabetes in this socially and economically marginalised population group."

A modest number of bacterial pathogens have been correlated with pulmonary function decline; however, microbiological and molecular evidence suggests that CF airway infection is polymicrobial. To obtain a more complete assessment of the microbial community composition and dynamics, we undertook a longitudinal study by using culture-independent and microbiological approaches. In the process, we demonstrated that within complex and dynamic communities, the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) can establish chronic pulmonary infections and at the onset of 39% of acute pulmonary exacerbations, SMG is the numerically dominant pathogen. We report the comprehensive polymicrobial community dynamics of a CF lung infection in a clinically relevant context. If a given organism, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, becomes resistant to antibiotic therapy, an alternative treatment avenue may mediate the desired clinical response by effectively managing the composition of the microbial community."

Treatment was so difficult that it required surgical debridement by video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), even after the appropriate administration of antibiotics. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) prophylaxis guidelines for preventing infective endocarditis indicate that it is uncommon to prescribe antibiotics to patients without background disease after dental extraction. No appropriate Japanese guidelines exist considering the prevention of SPE causing severe pyothorax as in our case.

GMS tend to cause purulent infections often resulting in abscess formation. Little is known about the significance of these organisms in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this retrospective study, a collection of 636 GMS positive isolates from 475 patients was used to identify 39 (8.2 %) paediatric patients (age &lt; 18 years) with GMS infections (46 isolates) during a four-year period. RESULTS: There were 19 intra-abdominal, eleven dental/oropharyngeal, seven soft tissue and two central nervous system infections. Thirty-five patients (95 %) underwent primary surgical interventions. Furthermore, two patients - one with GMS meningitis that progressed to cerebral empyema and another with a liver abscess - initially treated with antibiotic agents alone eventually required surgical intervention to cure the infection. Only two children were treated with antibiotics alone. Polymicrobial infection was found in 22 (48 %) isolates; polymicrobial infection was most common in patients with intra-abdominal infection with 74 % and lowest in dental/oropharyngeal patients with 9 % (p = 0.001); Escherichia coli (n = 9) and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 9) were the most common secondary pathogens. Complications due to GMS infections were found in five cases (13 %). No patient died from GMS infection. Preferred antibiotics were penicillins (56 %) and cephalosporins (37 %). GMS tested susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins, carbapenems in 100 % and clindamycin in 93 %. CONCLUSIONS: GMS infections in paediatric patients usually require both antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. These infections may become life-threatening if not diagnosed in a timely fashion and treated aggressively."

CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old man with a history of transient Parinaud syndrome at 37 years complained of headache for 2 months before acute onset of a left cerebellar syndrome without fever. CT-scan and MRI of the head revealed a heterogeneous left cerebellar lesion. A brain abscess was drained and all signs resolved. CT-scan of the chest revealed a left lingual PAVM; occlusion was incomplete after coil embolization. He had no feature of HHT and no mutation in ENG and ACVRL1 genes. A second embolization was performed 5 months later, but the malformation was not occluded at 6 months. DISCUSSION: We report the seventh case of PAVM complicated by a cerebellar abscess. The right to left shunt in PAVM results in hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia and paradoxical embolization of infective organisms bypassing the pulmonary filter. CONCLUSION: Combining different MRI techniques (in particular diffusion and proton MR spectroscopy) provides invaluable data for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Careful search for PAVM must be undertaken, particularly in adults with cryptogenic abscess, to avoid further abscess formation or stroke."

We have recently observed a number of cases of this infection among pediatric patients at our tertiary care, children's hospital. Our purpose was to investigate the computed tomographic (CT) findings and clinical features of S. milleri group pleuropulmonary infection in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used our hospital information system to identify all consecutive pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) who had both a microbiologically proven S. milleri group infection and a chest CT scan between December 1996 and May 2009. Each scan was systemically reviewed by 2 pediatric radiologists for pleural and lung parenchymal abnormalities. Pleural effusions were classified as either simple or complex and correlated with results of pleural fluid analysis. Computed tomographic findings were compared with chest radiographic findings in the subset of patients who underwent radiography within 24 hours of CT. Microbiological data, risk factors, immune status, patient management, and clinical outcome were systematically reviewed. RESULTS: The final study cohort consisted of 15 children (6 boys and 9 girls), ranging in age from 4.2 years to 17.7 years (mean, 10.8 years). All patients were immunocompetent without recognized risk factors for this infection. Thirteen pleural effusions were identified in 10 (67%) of the 15 patients, including 10 complex and 3 simple pleural effusions. All complex effusions at CT were consistent with empyemas by pleural fluid analysis. Lung parenchymal abnormalities were identified in 7 (47%) of the 15 patients, including lung abscess in 4 patients, consolidation in 2, and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules and lung abscesses in 1. In the subset of 7 patients with comparison radiographs, radiographic and CT findings were concordant for the detection of lung abnormalities, except one case in which consolidation was diagnosed on chest radiography, whereas CT scan showed a lung abscess. Radiographs detected all 4 complex pleural effusions seen on CT scan, although it was not possible to characterize the effusions as simple or complex on the radiographs. Interventional procedures were required in all 15 patients, most commonly thoracentesis (n = 11) and chest tube drainage (n = 9). CONCLUSIONS: In children with S. milleri group pleuropulmonary infection, CT often demonstrates complex pleural effusions and lung abscesses, which usually require interventional procedures for effective treatment."

Patients with Klebsiella spp. associated PLA tended to have more complications: bacteremia (61.6% vs. 31.6%, p &lt; 0.01) septic shock (33.6% vs. 19%, p = 0.11), disseminated intravascular coagulation (20.7% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.04), metastatic infections (10.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.06), acute renal and respiratory failure (5% vs. 0%, p = 0.14). However, both were effectively managed by the combination of antibiotics and image-guided aspiration with/without drainage, and their mortality rates were comparable to each other. Those patients with metastatic infection might need a longer duration (6.07 vs. 5.32 week, p = 0.144) of antibiotic therapy, which was due to the longer mean duration (3.85 vs. 2.86, p &lt; 0.04) of an intravenous counterpart. CONCLUSION: SM associated PLA tends to have a distinct clinical syndrome as compared with that of Klebsiella spp. with regard to risk factors, clinical manifestations and complications. However, both can be effectively treated with a combination of antibiotics and image-guided aspiration with/without drainage."

She has an atrial septal defect with atrial septal aneurysm, which remained undiagnosed until this clinical presentation. She presented with a short history of right-sided hemiplaegia and neuroimaging revealed a heterogeneous lesion in the left frontoparietal region. Neuronavigation-guided left frontoparietal craniotomy was performed to debulk the lesion and preoperatively frank pus was drained, which grew Streptococcus constellatus. She was successfully treated with antibiotics for 6 weeks and her clinical condition improved. We believe that the patients' previous dental extraction has possibly resulted in a paradoxical embolism through the atrial septal defect bypassing the pulmonary circulation. The MRI scan picture was misleading, as it was initially thought to be a high-grade brain tumour."

There are very few reports of disseminated infections sustained by members of this streptococcal group. We report a case of a highly disseminated infection and analyse previous literature reports. Disseminated pyogenic infection has been defined as an infection affecting two or more of the following organs/systems: central nervous system, lung, liver and spleen. We performed a PubMed search using the terms: S. milleri, S. anginosus, brain abscess, pulmonary abscess, hepatic abscess, spleen abscess. We reviewed 12 case reports including the one presented in this paper. Underlying conditions such as dental infections, malignancy, gastrointestinal and respiratory tract disease accounted for 42% of cases. No definite endocarditis was encountered, even though positive blood cultures were found in 67% of patients. Concomitant brain-liver, brain-lung and brain-spleen involvement occurred in 50%, 42% and 8% of cases respectively. Ninety-one percent (91%) of patients were treated with beta-lactams, and surgical procedures were performed in 67% of patients. Infections caused by S. anginosus group members are satisfactorily treated with penicillin G and cephalosporins. It is very important to associate surgery to antimicrobial chemotherapy in order to achieve a full or nearly full clinical recovery."

CSF samples were obtained 2 weeks apart, first by lumbar puncture and 2 weeks later from an external ventricular drain that was inserted into the right ventricle. Both CSF cultures were negative. A Gram stain of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was notable for many Gram-positive cocci (GPC), but cultures of BAL fluid and subcarinal lymph node biopsy tissue were negative. PCR/ESI-MS detected Streptococcus intermedius, a common cause of brain abscesses, in both CSF samples as well as in the fixed tissue from the biopsy. This unique case confirms S. intermedius pulmonary infection as the source of metastatic CNS infection and reveals the potential of PCR/ESI-MS to detect a streptococcal pathogen not captured by conventional cultures."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with acute S. milleri pneumonia who had undergone high-resolution CT chest examinations between January 2004 and March 2010 were retrospectively identified. Twenty-seven patients with concurrent infections were excluded. The final study group comprised 33 patients (25 men, 8 women; aged 20-88 years, mean 63.1 years) with S. milleri infection. The patients' clinical findings were assessed. Parenchymal abnormalities, enlarged lymph nodes, and pleural effusion were evaluated on high-resolution CT. RESULTS: Underlying conditions included malignancy (n = 15), a smoking habit (n = 11), and diabetes mellitus (n = 8). CT images of all patients showed abnormal findings, including ground-glass opacity (n = 24), bronchial wall thickening (n = 23), consolidation (n = 17), and cavities (n = 7). Pleural effusion was found in 18 patients, and complex pleural effusions were found in seven patients. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary infection caused by S. milleri was observed mostly in male patients with underlying conditions such as malignancy or a smoking habit. The CT findings in patients with S. milleri consisted mainly of ground-glass opacity, bronchial wall thickening, pleural effusions, and cavities."

(1985.2-1989.1) S. milleri was isolated from the following specimens: sputum (15 strains), urine (10), ascites (9), postoperative wound (9), pleural effusate (6), bile (5), genital discharge (3), aspirated fluid from lung abscess (2) and others (12). In 12 patients (18%), S. milleri was isolated in pure culture and in 56 patients (82%) as part of a mixed flora. Other bacteria isolated in association with S. milleri were obligate anaerobes (41%), Gram-negative rods (40%), Gram-positive cocci (16%) and others (3%). In 71 strains of S. milleri, 9 strains (13%) were beta-haemolytic, 62 (87%) were alpha-haemolytic (week) or non-haemolytic. In 68 patients, type specific male-female ratio was 15:9 for S. milleri I, 20:15 for II and 1:8 for III respectively. The patient's age ranged from 7 to 86 years and 75% of patients were more than 50 years old. In respiratory infection, 10 cases (pyothorax, 6; pneumonia, 3; lung abscess, 1) were related to S. milleri infection and considered clinically significant. 8 cases had underlying disease, however, 2 cases (pyothorax, lung abscess) had no underlying disease. In these 2 cases, S. milleri was isolated in pure culture. Successful treatment of these ten cases usually required either antibiotic therapy or drainage of the lesion. S. milleri was isolated from various clinical specimens and some cases were associated with serious infections. S. milleri was more commonly associated with suppurative infections than other viridans group streptococci. S. milleri may therefore have different characteristics which other streptococcal species of normal flora have not."

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study used laboratory records (January 2009 - May 2013) from a major hospital in Bahrain. Opportunistic infections (OIs); absolute CD4 counts, CD4%, and CD4/CD8 ratio were recorded. RESULTS: CD4% and absolute CD4 count in HIV patients with associated infections (157 +- 295) was significantly lower than in those without associated infections (471 +- 285) (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in CD4/CD8 ratio between the two groups. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest infection, present in 9.8% of total HIV-infected patients and 28.7% of members of the AIDS patient group with OIs, followed by yeast infections (9.2% and 27.2%, respectively). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was present in 3.6% of total HIV-infected patients and 10.6% of the group with OIs, while mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was present in 2.5% and 7.5%, respectively. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) was observed in 5.1% and 15.1%, respectively. Herpes simplex II (HSV-II) was observed in 3% and 9%, respectively, while Cytomegalovirus antigenemia was only present in 2% and 6%, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus milleri, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Citrobacter species were bacterial infections observed least frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Studying the pattern of OIs in HIV-infected patients in Bahrain is of paramount importance due to the scarcity of data in the Arab world. This will help to improve physicians' awareness to improve care of HIV-infected patients."

It is ordinarily difficult to distinguish them from contaminations as the causative pathogens of respiratory infections because they are often cultured in respiratory specimens. Therefore, it is important to understand the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of respiratory infections caused by the SAG members. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of the SAG bacteria in respiratory infections. METHODS: A total of 30 patients who were diagnosed with respiratory infections which were caused by the SAG bacteria between January 2005 and February 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG were mostly seen in male patients with comorbid diseases and were typically complicated with pleural effusion. Pleural effusion was observed in 22 (73.3%) patients. Empyema was observed in half of the 22 patients with pleural effusion. S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus were detected in 16 (53.3 %), 11 (36.7 %) and 3 (10.0 %) patients, respectively. Six patients had mixed-infections. The duration from the onset of symptoms to the hospital visit was significantly longer in ""lung abscess"" patients than in ""pneumonia"" patients among the 24 patients with single infections, but not among the six patients with mixed-infection. The peripheral white blood cell counts of the ""pneumonia"" patients were higher than those of the ""lung abscess"" patients and S. intermedius was identified significantly more frequently in patients with pulmonary and pleural infections (pneumonia and lung abscess) than in patients with bacterial pleurisy only. In addition, the patients in whom S. intermedius was cultured were significantly older than those in whom S. constellatus was cultured. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory infections caused by the SAG bacteria tended to be observed more frequently in male patients with comorbid diseases and to more frequently involve purulent formation. In addition, S. intermedius was mainly identified in elderly patients with having pulmonary infection complicated with pleural effusion, and the aspiration of oral secretions may be a risk factor in the formation of empyema thoracis associated with pneumonia due to S. intermedius."

Recent research suggests they play a role in exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). Owing to poor recovery on standard culture media and difficult differentiation from non-pathogenic streptococci, SMG may be underdiagnosed in routine settings. We aimed to establish the incidence of SMG in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients compared to CF patients and to examine possible links of SMG to exacerbations that plays a key role in progression of COPD. METHODS: Altogether, 90 respiratory tract samples of patients suffering from CF or COPD were examined during the period from July 2012 to December 2013. Semi-selective McKay agar was used for primary cultivation of SMG and MALDI TOF MS was used for species identification that was confirmed by biochemical profiling and specific PCR. RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of SMG in CF (17.6% incidence in adult patients) and newly established its presence in COPD (10.3% incidence). In COPD, SMG was detected in 4 cases of acute exacerbations, where no other bacterial pathogen was detected. In 3/4 cases, increased CRP level indicated bacterial infection as a cause of the exacerbation and in all 3 cases, patients recovered during antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate SMG may act as opportunist pathogens able to cause exacerbations in COPD."

Although several small studies have been reported, the features of SAG pneumonia remain unclear, because the identification of SAG from sputum cultures is not routinely performed in most microbiology laboratories. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics of SAG pneumonia. PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study utilizing data obtained in our hospital between September 2009 and June 2016. We investigated 31 patients with SAG pneumonia (PWP), and also assessed the difference between the 31 PWP and 37 patients without pneumonia (PWOP) in whose sputum SAG was detected. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the patients were men and the median age was 78 years in the PWP. Univariate analysis indicated that the PWP were significantly more often a bed-ridden (p &lt; 0.01) with comorbid aspiration than were the PWOP (p &lt; 0.05). Among the PWP, nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) was the more common type of pneumonia (54.8%). S. anginosus was detected significantly more frequently in sputum cultures of PWP than PWOP (p &lt; 0.01), and multiple pathogens were detected more frequently in PWP (p &lt; 0.01). Streptococcus constellatus was the most frequently detected pathogen in patients with a single bacterial infection. Empyema was observed only in patients with multiple bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: SAG should be recognized as important causative pathogens of pneumonia, particularly among elderly patients with underlying disease associated with aspiration. NHCAP was the more common type of SAG pneumonia in this study."

We conducted a prospective study to compare the sensitivity of the sputum and urinary antigen kits. Methods Pneumonia patients who were treated from April 2014 to September 2015 were recruited for the present study. Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who could not participate in the prospective arm of the study were analyzed in the retrospective arm. Results Nine of the 69 participants in the prospective study had pneumococcal pneumonia. The sputum antigen kit results correlated well with the sputum culture results. The sensitivity of the sputum antigen kit was 88.9% (8/9), which was higher than that of the urinary antigen kit (5/9; 55.6%). When patients from the retrospective arm of the study were included, the sensitivity of the sputum culture was 93.5% (29/31), which was significantly higher than that of the urinary antigen kit (19/31; 60.6%). False positives were obtained using the sputum antigen kit in four cases. Three of the four false positives were suspected to have resulted from the administration of antibiotics prior to the use of the kit; the remaining case likely occurred due to a false reaction to S. milleri-induced pyothorax. Conclusion Collectively, our findings suggest that the sputum antigen kit has a higher sensitivity for detecting S. pneumoniae than the urinary antigen kit. However, the prior administration of antibiotics can render the sputum culture results negative or lead to a false-positive result."

In the course of time, diagnostic criteria have been updated and validated to reduce misdiagnosis. Some risk factors and epidemiology have shown dynamic changes since degenerative valvular disease became more predominant in developed countries, and the mean age of the affected population increased. Despite streptococci have been being well known as etiologic agents, some groups, although rare, have been increasingly reported (e.g., Streptococcus milleri.) Intracardiac complications of IE are common and have a worse prognosis, frequently requiring surgical treatment. We report a case of a middle-aged diabetic man who presented with prolonged fever, weight loss, and ultimately severe dyspnea. IE was diagnosed based on a new valvular regurgitation murmur, a positive blood culture for Streptococcus anginosus, an echocardiographic finding of an aortic valve vegetation, fever, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Despite an appropriate antibiotic regimen, the patient died. Autopsy findings showed vegetation attached to a bicuspid aortic valve with an associated septal abscess and left ventricle and aortic root fistula connecting with the pulmonary artery. A large thrombus was adherent to the pulmonary artery trunk and a pulmonary septic thromboemboli were also identified."

In fact the ocular signs and symptoms may be associated with systemic complications which should be investigated and identified as soon as possible to avoid a poor prognosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old white woman presented to our emergency room with proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and conjunctival chemosis of her left eye. An ophthalmologist, having diagnosed orbital cellulitis in her left eye, suspected a cavernous sinus thrombosis. Hematochemical and radiological examinations confirmed the cavernous sinus thrombosis and also showed septic pulmonary embolism. A blood culture indicated Streptococcus constellatus, which is a member of the Peptostreptococcus family, a saprophyte of the oral mucosa that can be pathogenic in immunocompromised persons. The odontogenic origin was then confirmed by dental radiography which showed a maxillary abscess. Her eye signs regressed after antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This complex case shows the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for the management of orbital cellulitis, for the prompt diagnosis and treatment of eye injuries and possible complications, so as to avoid serious and permanent sequelae."

In 51 patients (median age: 43 years, no underlying diseases in 29 patients), the isolates were associated with significant infections. They were beta-hemolytic in 32 cases and non-hemolytic in 19. The primary infection sites were the head and neck area (21 cases), the lungs (5 cases of pneumonia), the gastrointestinal tract (12 cases), the urogenital tract (3 cases), the soft tissues (6 cases), and the heart (2 endocarditis). Two septicemias were of unknown origin. Head and neck infections and pneumonia were most often associated with beta-hemolytic strains, and bacteremia, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract infections with alpha-hemolytic strains. S. milleri was found in pure culture in 24 cases. Polymicrobial associated flora (27 cases) was more frequent in the abdominal infections (87%) than in supra-diaphragmatic infections (42%). Severe complications were observed in 12 head and neck infections (57%) (cerebral abscesses 3, lethal mediastinitis 2, osteitis 1, meningitis 1, other suppurative lesions 5). When abscesses were present (27 cases), surgery was required in all cases. Despite the high frequency and severity of local complications, the clinical outcome was usually favorable. However, deaths directly related to S. milleri infections occurred in 2 cases of mediastinitis complicating the course of apparently harmless primary infections. Owing to the possible occurrence of life-threatening complications, S. milleri infections require early identification, treatment and surgery when indicated."

Therefore, the major causative organisms are oral or gastric bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the anaerobic bacteria which can cause aspiration pneumonia, Fusobacterium spp., Finegoldia magna, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Streptococcus milleri group to ceftriaxone, cefmetazole, flomoxef, ampicillin/sulbactam, and ampicillin. We also tested the beta-lactamase activities of each of the bacterial strains. Fusobacterium spp. and Finegoldia magna were susceptible to all of the tested antimicrobial drugs, except ampicillin, and showed no beta-lactamase activity. The Streptococcus milleri group, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. showed decreased susceptibility to cefmetazole or flomoxef as compared to the susceptibility levels documented in a previous report. There was one strain of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius which was not susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam, but also showed no beta-lactamase activity, suggesting that this strain harbored a mechanism of resistance other than the production of beta-lactamase. The susceptibility of Prevotella spp. to ceftriaxone was also decreased as compared to the susceptibility level documented in a previous report. Furthermore, beta-lactamase-positive strains were found even among ceftriaxone-susceptible strains. Elderly persons with swallowing dysfunction carry a risk of recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia and repeated use of antibiotics increases the risk of development of antibiotic resistance. In the present study, the antibiotic susceptibilities of some of organisms which can cause aspiration pneumonia were found to be decreased as compared to the susceptibility levels documented in a previous report. Therefore, surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these bacteria is recommended to prevent the development of resistance."

Accurate understanding of the clinical characteristics and etiology of bacterial pleuritis is an issue that must be addressed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of the bacterial species in bacterial pleuritis. METHODS: Pleural effusion samples were obtained from 29 patients with bacterial pleuritis. The microbiota of pleural effusion samples was analyzed with clone library analysis using the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. RESULTS: The phylotypes of Fusobacterium spp. (24.1%) were most frequently the predominant phylotypes, followed by those of Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) (20.7%) and S. aureus (17.2%). The predominant phylotypes of obligate anaerobes, including the Fusobacterium spp., were detected in 11 of 29 patients (37.9%). Patients in the SAG group were significantly older and presented lower serum albumin levels than those in the obligate anaerobe and other bacteria groups. Patients from the obligate anaerobe group took longer to present symptoms, and therefore diagnosis of pleuritis was also delayed, in comparison to patients in the other bacterial group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that there were characteristic differences between patients in SAG, obligate anaerobe, and other bacterial groups. Physicians may need to consider treatment strategy options based on the clinical characteristics of patients with bacterial pleuritis."

Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs), characterized by abnormal direct communication between pulmonary artery and vein, are a rare underlying cause of brain abscesses. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a previous healthy 55-year-old man who presented with 5 days of headache and fever. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested a brain abscess. Thoracic CT scan and angiography demonstrated PAVFs. Aiding by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample which identified S. intermedius as the causative pathogen, the patient was switched to the single therapy of large dose of penicillin G and was cured precisely and economically. CONCLUSIONS: It is an alternative way to perform mNGS to identify causative pathogens in patients with brain abscesses especially when the results of traditional bacterial culture were negative. Further thoracic CT or pulmonary angiography should also be undertaken to rule out PAVFs as the potential cause of brain abscess if the patient without any known premorbid history."

Methods: A total of 26 patients diagnosed in Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University from January 2014 to October 2019 were enrolled. The analyzed clinical data included baseline data, clinical symptoms, imaging manifestations, therapies, and outcomes. The microbiological diagnosis was established based on the specimens collected by lung needle biopsy, bronchoscopy, artificial airway aspiration, thoracentesis or thoracoscopy. Results: Among the 26 patients, there were 23 (88.5%) males and 3 (11.5%) females aged (63.0+-12.5) years, and 21 cases (80.8%) had potential diseases. The distribution of clinical manifestations included 21 cases (80.8%) with fever, 13 cases (50.0%) with pectoralgia, 13 cases (50.0%) with cough, and 13 cases (50.0%) with expectoration. Chest CT displayed 18 cases (69.2%) with nodules, 18 cases (69.2%) with pleural effusion, 17 cases (65.4%) with patchy shadows, 12 cases (46.2%) with consolidation, 4 cases (15.4%) with cavity, 3 cases (11.5%) with spontaneous pneumothorax. 13 cases (50.0%) of Streptococcus constellatus, 12 cases (46.2%) of Streptococcus anginosus and 1 case (3.8%) of Streptococcus intermadius were observed through the bacterial culture. After anti-infection treatment and invasive operation (including tracheoscopy, thoracoscopy, lung puncture, and thoracic puncture drainage), the prognosis of 24 cases (92.3%) became satisfactory, and 2 (7.7%) died. Conclusion: Pulmonary infection caused by SAG is mainly seen in male patients with underlying diseases. No specificity is displayed in clinical manifestations.

CASE PRESENTATION: We described a woman with poorly controlled diabetes and steroid-dependent asthma who presented in a deep coma. She was found to have Streptococcus intermedius bacteremia and pyogenic ventriculitis that originated from right middle lobe pneumonia. Also, multiple small parenchymal lesions were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging and increased protein concentration was noted in cerebral spinal fluid. Initially, her coma was thought to be due to diabetic ketoacidosis and septic encephalopathy. However, her lowered level of consciousness was disproportionate to either diabetic ketoacidosis or septic encephalopathy, and her clinical course was not as expected for these two conditions. Treatment with antibiotic, corticosteroid and antihelminthic drugs was administered resulting in improving consciousness. The Streptococcus intermedius pneumonia progressed to form a large cavity that needed an early surgical lobectomy and resulted in the unexpected diagnosis of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosus.

While the ""viridans"" streptococci cannot be serologically differentiated, physiological separation of the species offers a satisfactory method of classifying human isolates. We review the microbiology of Lancefield group F and related streptococci (S. milleri, S. anginosus), emphasizing microbial ecology and current taxonomic considerations. A series of 28 patients infected with these organisms is presented. There was a striking male predominance in the series (6:1) as well as an obvious association with underlying diseases and/or antecedent trauma. The most remarkable feature of these pathogens is their predilection for abscess formation, confirming their overdue recognition as the most common ""viridans"" streptococcus recovered from abscesses within internal organs. We observed purulent disease of the nervous and skeletal systems, oral cavity, lung and pleural space, abdomen and subcutaneous tissues. Microbial synergy (i.e. polymicrobic infection) was not a requisite for abscess formation. Four of the five deaths in this series occurred in patients 60 years of age of older.

Although several small series have been reported, the clinical and laboratory features have yet to be fully characterised. METHODS: Twenty five cases were identified and the clinical and laboratory data from case records were analysed. RESULTS: There were 16 empyemas, five lung abscesses, and four with both lung abscess and empyema. The mean age of the patients was 61 years (range 36-89) and 84% were men. The most common symptoms at presentation were shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and weight loss; only 36% had a fever. Four of the nine patients with lung abscess required a diagnostic lobectomy because of suspected malignancy. Predisposing factors were present in 80% of patients and included the following: pneumonia, periodontal disease, excess alcohol intake, previous thoracic surgical procedures, and malignancy. Laboratory features of S milleri infection were leucocytosis, neutrophilia, anaemia, abnormal liver function tests, and hypoalbuminaemia. In the group with empyema five patients had a pneumothorax on initial presentation and pleural loculation occurred in 10 of these patients. The median stay in hospital was 34 days (range 11-88). Six patients died, five of whom had significant underlying illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary infection with S milleri may result in considerable morbidity and mortality, and is characterised by a strong male predominance, non-specific symptoms (often without toxicity), the presence of predisposing factors, pleural loculation, pneumothorax, and a protracted stay in hospital."

The patients (six males and two females) with infectious diseases caused by Streptococcus milleri ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old with an average age of 62.0 years. The infectious diseases encountered among the patients were pyothorax in three patients, and in one patient each pyothorax and lung abscess, pleurisy, a secondary infection of pulmonary emphysema, skin infection related to a tracheostomy, a subdural abscess and a brain abscess, respectively. Six out of the eight cases had infections which formed pus. An underlying disease existed in seven cases, and, in five of these seven cases, it influenced the general condition of these patients. Six serum antibody titers for the S. milleri groups were examined in the First Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Ryukyus. Three cases for S. anginosus, two cases for S. intermedius, and one case for S. constellatus showed high titers of X1024 or X2048. Therefore, the examination of the serum antibody titer seems useful for the diagnosis of infections caused by the S. milleri group. We also carried out a comparative investigation of the backgrounds and factors of infectious diseases caused by S. milleri and S. pneumoniae.

CASE REPORT: A 12.5 year-old boy was admitted because he had suffered from fever for 6 days. He also had headache, diffuse abdominal pain, chills and a cough. Laboratory investigations showed leukocytes: 9,300/mm3 (PMN: 6,700/mm3; lymphocytes: 1,400/mm3; monocytes: 1,200/mm3); hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dl; platelets: 106,000/mm3; sedimentation rate: 120 mm at 1 hour; blood fibrinogen: 5.6 g/l and C-reactive protein: 193 mg/l. His chest X-rays was normal. Four blood cultures showed Streptococcus milleri. The patient was given amoxicillin (150 mg/kg/d) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg/d). Two foci of dental infection were found and treated by tooth extraction. Blood cultures remained positive 2, 3 and 6 days after onset of treatment and a second chest X-rays and CT scan showed several bilateral pulmonary abscesses. Cardiac ultrasonographs showed no valvular vegetations. The patient was then given ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d) plus rifampicin (20 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d). Blood culture was negative two days later, but the fever persisted and ceftriaxone was then successfully replaced by vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) for three weeks.

Clinical features of upper respiratory tract infection and pyogenic pharyngitis as well as colony counts were tabulated for each patient according to throat culture results. Of 1,480 patients, Lancefield group C Streptococcus equisimilis was isolated from 45 (3%) patients and Streptococcus anginosus (""Streptococcus milleri"") was isolated from 164 (11.1%) patients. Patients from whom S. equisimilis was isolated had clinical features more suggestive of pyogenic infection than did patients from whom S. anginosus was isolated. Colony counts on primary throat culture plates from patients from whom S. equisimilis and Streptococcus pyogenes were isolated were higher than those from patients from whom S. anginosus was isolated. This study presents epidemiologic evidence supporting a role for S. equisimilis in causing pharyngeal infection and for S. anginosus as representing part of the normal oropharyngeal flora."

Nineteen cases were male and 4 female, with a mean age of 59.6 years (range; 33 to 84 y.o.). There were 15 cases of community-acquired infection and 8 of nosocomial infection. Acute pneumonia and/or lung abscess developed into empyema in 19 cases. Sixteen cases had associated predisposing conditions, such as diabetes, chronic bronchitis, disorders with dysphagia, and excess alcohol intake. Forty-one strains were isolated from empyema in 22 cases. The predominant organisms, in order of prevalence, were ""Streptococcus milleri"" group (11 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp. (6), Prevotella spp. (6), Fusobacterium spp. (5) and other viridans streptococci (3). The majority of streptococcal infections, which were primarily caused by ""S. milleri"" group, were mixed with anaerobes and/or aerobes/facultatives. These results demonstrate that oral streptococci, especially ""S. milleri"" group, and anaerobes play a significant role as pathogens in empyema."

Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%).

In the studies reviewed here, a specific pathogen was identified in 39% to 88% of patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Depending on the demographics of the study, between 2% to 43% of cases have been attributed to legionella or Chlamydia pneumoniae.

An analysis of 18 episodes].ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus milleri group streptococci (SMG). METHODS: Prospective evaluation of all bacteremic episodes with clinical significance from 1990 to 1995 in two general hospitals. In this study all episodes caused by SMG were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 905 bacteremic episodes with clinical significance were detected; 18 (1.98%) were caused by SMG (0.16/1,000 admissions). The mean age of patients were 43 years and the male/female ratio 1.6. Seventeen patients (94.4%) had some underlying disease; nine patients had diabetes, four were parenteral drug abusers, and two had neoplasms. The most common sources of bacteremia were intraabdominal in four episodes (two liver abscesses, one subphrenic abscess and one pancreatic pseudocyst), cutaneous and/or soft tissues in four, surgical wound in two and respiratory in two; no source was identified in five episodes. Four episodes had a polymicrobial origin. In 13 isolates the identification was at species level (Streptococcus anginosus eight, Streptococcus intermedius four and Streptococcus constellatus one). All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Six patients (33.3%) required surgery. In ten episodes a favorable outcome was recorded, although four patients required surgery. The infection associated mortality rate was 31.2%. The mean age of deceased patients was higher than for cured patients (62.2 +/- 20.2 versus 35.3 +/- 20.3; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SMB bacteremia is uncommon. It involved mainly diabetic patients or parenteral drug abusers, commonly with an intraabdominal suppurative source or in skin or soft tissues.

A total of 76 strains of viridans streptococci were isolated, of which the most common isolates were Streptococcus constellatus (21 strains), S. intermedius (17), and S. sanguis (10). Species belonging to the S. milleri group accounted for the majority (68%) of isolates. In 38 (53%) patients these organisms were recognized as the sole pathogens. Of the 72 patients, 53 had empyema, 14 had lung abscesses, and five had both empyema and lung abscess. Forty-six (64%) patients had underlying diseases. Of these, malignancies were the most common (17 patients), followed by diabetes mellitus (12 patients) and central nervous system diseases (10 patients). Of the 48 patients who underwent chest-tube drainage, 27 (56%) received further treatments, including intrapleural streptokinase (18 cases), surgery (9), and both intrapleural streptokinase and surgery (3). Two (14%) of the patients with lung abscess alone underwent surgical treatment. Although all viridans streptococcal isolates were susceptible to penicillin, the patients in the study had a high mortality (21%). Univariate and multivariate analysis of data for patients with empyema alone (n = 53) showed a significantly increased risk of death in those with underlying malignancy (OR = 16.0, p = 0.023) and those with non-S. milleri-group isolates (OR = 3.72, p = 0.030). These data imply a strong clinical significance of viridans streptococci in the pathogenesis of empyema and lung abscess, as well as the need for species identification of viridans streptococci in patients with pleuropulmonary diseases."

The clinical histories and microbiology reports were reviewed in 27 cases of thoracic infection caused by SM over a period of 8 yrs. Cases of pneumococcal empyema that occurred during the same period were also analysed. Diagnoses were made of cases of empyema, including six with pneumonia and one with pulmonary abscess, three cases of pneumonia and two of mediastinitis. In 17 cases, SM was the only pathogen isolated. There was a history of instrument or surgical procedures on the digestive or respiratory tract in 59%. Secondary bacteraemia was documented in three cases. The treatment administered, a combination of antibiotics and surgery, was successful in 22 of 27 (81%) of cases. All strains were susceptible to penicillin. When the characteristics of the empyemas caused by monomicrobial SM infection were compared with those of pneumococcal aetiology from the same period of study, significant differences were found with respect to age, origin of the infection and the need for surgery. In conclusion, thoracic infections caused by Streptococcus milleri are largely pleural. They are polymicrobial in one-third of cases, commonly acquired in hospital and, in most patients, associated with major surgery and/or surgical procedures of the respiratory or digestive tract. The empyema frequently requires thoracotomy for complete resolution."

DESIGN: Prospective study over a 3-year period. SETTING: A community general hospital in Japan. PATIENTS: Three hundred twenty-six episodes of community-acquired pneumonia in 318 patients admitted to the hospital between July 1994 and June 1997. METHODS: The microbiological diagnosis was based on the results of quantitative sputum culture, blood culture, and other invasive procedures, including transthoracic needle aspiration or bronchoscopic examination. Serologic tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp, Legionella spp, and viruses were also routinely performed. RESULTS: Causative pathogens were identified in 199 episodes (61%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (23%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (7.4%), M pneumoniae (4.9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.3%). The Streptococcus milleri group and Chlamydia pneumoniae were detected in 3.7 and 3.4% of the episodes, respectively. Pneumonia due to Legionella spp was recognized in only two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan did not differ markedly when compared with that of Western countries except for the low incidence of Legionella pneumonia.

In conjunction with the case report, the authors review the literature on the pathogenesis of brain abscesses and discuss therapeutic strategies concerning the topic. In the case presented, the primary infection persisted in the lung causing subclinical bronchitis. The hemoculture showed evidence of Streptococcus mitis infection. Although the etiological role of this bacterium in meningitis is known, it rarely causes bacterial meningitis without underlying predisposing factors. In their case, the patient was free of the most common predisposing factors such as congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency. Following the 2 month period of latency, a rapid onset of the symptoms of intracranial inflammation could be observed: fever, headache, meningeal symptoms, focal neurological symptoms and coma. They were not able to identify any bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid; the Streptocossus mitis could be cultivated only from the haemoculture. The cytological analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid showed typical signs of bacterial infection and the cranial Computed Tomography revealed multiple cerebral abscesses. Neurosurgical intervention was not recommended because of the number, localization and size of the focal lesions.

The pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae), an important human pathogen, is traditionally distinguished from the most closely related oral streptococcal species Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis on the basis of three differentiating characteristics: optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination with antipneumococcal polysaccharide capsule antibodies. However, there are many reports in the literature of pneumococci lacking one or more of these defining characteristics. Sometimes called ""atypical"" pneumococci, these isolates can be the source of considerable confusion in the clinical laboratory. Little is known to date about the genetic relationships of such organisms with classical S. pneumoniae isolates. Here we describe these relationships based on sequence analysis of housekeeping genes in comparison with previously characterized isolates of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis, and S. oralis. While most pneumococci were found to represent a closely related group these studies identified a subgroup of atypical pneumococcal isolates (bile insoluble and/or ""acapsular"") distinct from, though most closely related to, the ""typical"" pneumococcal isolates. However, a large proportion of isolates, found to be atypical on the basis of capsule reaction alone, did group with typical pneumococci, suggesting that they have either lost capsule production or represent as-yet-unrecognized capsular types. In contrast to typical S. pneumoniae, isolates phenotypically identified as S. mitis and S. oralis, which included isolates previously characterized in taxonomic studies, were genetically diverse. While most of the S. oralis isolates did fall into a well-separated group, S. mitis isolates did not cluster into a well-separated group. During the course of these studies we also identified a number of potentially important pathogenic isolates, which were frequently associated with respiratory disease, that phenotypically and genetically are most closely related to S. mitis but which harbor genes encoding the virulence determinants pneumolysin and autolysin classically associated with S. pneumoniae."

The severity of this case of endocarditis was illustrated by the importance of the vasculitis, the biological signs of infection (disseminated intravascular coagulation), and the size of the vegetation. The vegetation extended from the tricuspid valve as far as the pulmonary orifice which was partially obstructed, causing signs of right ventricular failure. The portal of entry was not found. Surgical ablation of the vegetation with tricuspid valvuloplasty was necessary after 48 hours of antibiotherapy. The outcome after one year's follow-up is good. The diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis must be considered even in very young children, especially those with congenital heart disease, and, in particular, ventricular septal defect."

Ten (11%) of these 88 cases were associated with serious complications: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) plus septic shock (5 cases), ARDS (3), and septic shock (2). Streptococcus mitis was the species most frequently isolated (7 of 10 episodes). Four viridans streptococci showed a diminished susceptibility to penicillin (MICs ranged from 0.25 to 4 microg/mL), and 5 strains were resistant to ceftazidime (MICs ranged from 2 to &gt;32 microg/mL). Patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia (VSB) who developed serious complications were compared with patients with VSB without complications. Severe oral mucositis (70% vs. 32.5%, respectively; P=.036), high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (60% vs. 25%, respectively; P=.043), and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (40% vs. 10%, respectively; P=.040) were the only variables found to be significantly associated with the development of complications. Neither a specific species of viridans streptococci nor resistance to penicillin was associated with the occurrence of complications. The mortality rate was higher in case patients than in control patients (80% vs. 17.5%, respectively; P&lt;.001).

Although in general these cocci are quite indolent, Streptococcus mitis is associated with serious complications such as sepsis and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome. Neutropenia is the most significant predisposing factor but the impact of mucositis, i.e. damage to the mucosal barrier of mouth and intestines (mucosal barrier injury, MBI), is very much greatly underestimated. Oral mucositis is a strong predictor of OVS bacteremia and simultaneously CoNS bacteremia is clearly associated with mucositis. Treatment with especially high dose cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and idarubicin, when given to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, predictably results in mucositis. Hence, the occurrence of mucositis should have implications for complementing empirical therapy with specific drugs such as glycopeptides, because risk patients can be selected based upon the chemotherapeutic therapy administered. An algorithm is presented for dealing with patients at high risk of mucositis and bacteremia due to Gram-positive cocci."

METHOD: Retrospective clinical study of 17 consecutive adult patients who presented to the Royal Melbourne Hospital between January 1988 and December 2000 was undertaken. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 47 years (range 20-87 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 1.8 : 1.0. Peak incidence occurred in September during early spring. All patients presented with sore throat and dysphagia; however, respiratory distress was only noted in 65%. The most common signs were temperature and tachycardia. Four patients (23%) required endotracheal intubation, which was performed electively in three and as an emergency in one. Three of 14 blood cultures were positive, two yielded Haemophilus influenzae type b and one yielded Streptococcus mitis. One of the four throat cultures was positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b. Twelve patients underwent awake flexible laryngoscopy under topical anaesthetic as part of their initial assessment, and there were no complications associated with this procedure. There was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of acute epiglottitis in the adult population is difficult as respiratory distress may be absent. Patients who have a significant sore throat with no obvious aetiology should have direct visualization of their larynx by flexible laryngoscopy. Lateral X-ray of neck is of limited value.

They concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. These patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). Seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. During 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. In six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). Most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten Streptococcus mitis, five S. oralis, two S. sanguis, three S. pneumoniae). A single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The enterococci were one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium. Ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L of penicillin G, ten were less susceptible (0.5 &lt; or = MIC &lt; 32 mg/L), and a strain was resistant (MIC = 32 mg/L). Eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. For three strains, the MICs of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/L and 8-32 mg/L, respectively) were higher. Levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. All species were susceptible to glycopeptides. Three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. Their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. This results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients."

Risk factors in this patient population include severe neutropenia, oral mucositis, administration of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and antimicrobial prophylaxis with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone. In some patients with cancer and neutropenia who develop viridans streptococcal bacteremia, a toxic shock-like syndrome has been described; Streptococcus mitis has been the causative species in most cases. Because resistance of viridans streptococci to a variety of antimicrobial agents is increasingly recognized, penicillin susceptibility cannot be assumed, and empirical vancomycin therapy should be used to treat neutropenic patients with cancer who have shock or are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Given the seriousness of septicemia caused by viridans streptococci and the potential for selection of other resistant microorganisms, the routine practice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for neutropenic patients with cancer should be reconsidered."

Our aim was to investigate healthy adults for oropharyngeal carriage of VGS that are resistant to macrolides, as well as to other common antibiotics. METHODS: Macrolide-resistant VGS were isolated from throat samples of 154 healthy Belgian adults, and phenotyped and genotyped for erm(A), erm(B) and mef(A). In vitro susceptibilities to 10 antimicrobials and the presence of tetracycline resistance genes were also determined. RESULTS: Carriage was detected in 71% of the population screened, from whom 157 unique, macrolide-resistant VGS were isolated. A constitutive (cMLS) phenotype was present in 105 isolates, of which 102 isolates carried either erm(B) or erm(B) + mef(A). The remaining three isolates did not present with any of the genes studied. All 45 isolates showing the M phenotype carried mef(A). The least abundant inducible (iMLS) isolates (n = 7) carried either erm(B) or erm(B) + mef(A). The most abundant macrolide-resistant VGS species was Streptococcus mitis (51%). Co-resistance to tetracycline was identified in 114 isolates, of which tet(M) was present in 105, tet(O) in two and both tet(M) and tet(O) in one, while the remaining six isolates did not present with either gene. tet(M) was also present in four tetracycline susceptible and two intermediately resistant isolates. Fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin MIC &gt; or = 4 mg/L) was detected in 16 isolates. Resistance to telithromycin, penicillin and chloramphenicol was appreciably low.

Forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microL). Only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. Twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. Five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome. The source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection.

","SPECIES:Streptococcus mitisID:17712470TITLE:Clinical features and complications of viridans streptococci bloodstream infection in pediatric hemato-oncology patients.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Viridans streptococci (VS) are part of the normal flora of humans, but are fast emerging as pathogens causing bacteremia in neutropenic patients. The clinical features, outcomes, and antibiotic susceptibilities of VS bloodstream infections in children with hemato-oncological diseases are reported in this study. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients (&lt; or =18 years) diagnosed with VS infections between January 1998 and December 2004 was conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital. RESULTS: Among the 26 episodes noted in 25 pediatric patients, the incidence rate of VS bacteremia was found to be significantly higher in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared with other hemato-oncological conditions. Most of the patients had profound neutropenia related to chemotherapy for a median of 5 days on the day of positive blood culture. Eight of the 25 patients had undergone stem cell transplantations. Streptococcus mitis was the most common bloodstream isolate and only 12 (44%) of the 27 isolated strains of VS were penicillin-susceptible. Empirical antibiotic treatments were not effective in half of the episodes, but did not affect overall mortality. Isolated bacteremia (63%) and pneumonia (22%) were the two leading clinical presentations. Complications were recognized more frequently in patients with pneumonia. Hypotension and mechanical ventilation each developed in 8 patients (31%). The overall mortality rate was 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin non-susceptible VS infection has emerged as a threat in children with hemato-oncological diseases, especially those with acute myeloid leukemia. S. mitis is the most common spp. of VS causing bacteremia in children and is associated with serious complications. The development of pneumonia resulted in clinical complications and higher mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatments with activity against the infecting strains did not reduce the overall mortality rate in this study."

General aspects and case report].ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis due to viridans streptococci is associated with a mortality of 5-10%. Even today, it remains difficult to diagnose it at an early stage, to select a sufficient antibiotic therapy and to choose the right time for surgical intervention. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old male patient presented with anemia, fever, adynamia and a loud systolic murmur over the base of the heart. Blood culture data were positive for Streptococcus mitis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valve with regurgitations as well as a hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The hemodynamically stable patient was treated with penicillin G, gentamicin and verapamil. Because of an extension of valve vegetations and a decline in the hemodynamic situation with an incipient sepsis, the patient was surgically treated urgently by replacement of the aortic and mitral valve as well as a Morrow septal myectomy. A postoperative sepsis required the application of high catecholamine doses. Because of a respiratory insufficiency, a prolonged mechanical ventilation was required. Finally, the patient could be discharged for in-hospital rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: The indication for surgical therapy in patients with endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valve as well as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy should be critically discussed with regard to the patient's age, the aims of conservative therapy, and the consequences of a surgical intervention. If there are any indices of a disease progress in spite of antibiotic therapy, patients should be subjected to cardiac surgery immediately."

However, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions have been reported. In this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of HIV-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. Conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci as Streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all bile soluble. However, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. Genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true S. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. Of these, 10 most closely resembled a subgroup of Streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. CGH also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the non-typable isolates. Sequencing of part of the 16S rRNA gene and investigation for the presence of ply by PCR corroborated these results. In conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the Mitis group, and show that both MLSA and CGH enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other Mitis group streptococci."

The etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in Taiwan, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of CALA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 Japanese adult patients with CALA to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. We used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle aspiration and protected specimen brushes. RESULTS: Of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. Pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. The four most common etiologic pathogens were Streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), Gemella species (9.8%), and K. pneumoniae (8.2%). Streptococcus mitis was the most common among the Streptococcus species. Mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. Six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. Two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. CONCLUSIONS: The first and second most common etiologic pathogens of CALA in our hospital were Streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. The etiologies in our study differ from those in Taiwan and are similar to those in the West with the exception that Streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in Western countries. S. mitis and Gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. The identification of Actinomyces and Nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration."

METHOD: A retrospective hospital infection study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from January 2005 to December 2008. RESULT: Six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as HAP. The incidence of HAP was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset HAP and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset HAP. The HAP patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). The proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. Main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. There was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in ICU, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. Two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. One hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. There were 30 (13.0%) Gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%) fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. The predominant bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations cephalosporins. The main pathogens of early-onset HAP were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset HAP were ESBLs-positive Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: HAP in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. The main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. RSV was an important pathogen of HAP. The pathogens of early-onset HAP are different from those of late-onset HAP. These results may be of some help in prevention and control of HAP in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice."

METHODS: The clinical data of 230 neonates who were admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and received mechanical ventilation for equal to or longer than 48 hrs in 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The isolated pathogens were compared with those of eight years ago. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP (25.2%) in the year 2008 was lower than that of eight years ago (36.1%; P&lt;0.05). The development of VAP was negatively correlated with the gestational age and the birth weight, but positively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation, intubation times, duration of hospitalization, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. The main isolated pathogens were opportunistic antibiotics resistant bacteria, and the majority was gram negative bacilli (77%). The most frequently detected gram negative bacilli were Klebsiella (20%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18%) and Acinetobacter (13%). Streptococcus mitis was the most frequently detected gram positive bacilli (14%). The distribution pattern of pathogens isolated in the same NICU eight years ago was somewhat different: Klebsiella (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Acinetobacter (16%), Streptococcus mitis (11%), Fungi (1%) and Candida albicans (1%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VAP is correlated with gestational age, birth weight, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, intubation times, presence of gastrointestinal bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. The main isolated pathogens are usually antibiotic resistant opportunistic bacteria. The detection rate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia increased and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased when compared with eight years ago."

Four of the patients had been treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside as part of the cytostatic regimen, six had a central venous line and four patients had oral lesions prior to the infection. Selective gut decontamination consisted of co-trimoxazole/colistin in five patients and quinolones in three patients. The first three patients died, either due to interstitial pneumonia with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or due to infection-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation despite prompt empiric antibiotic therapy including vancomycin. The other patients improved after empiric supplementation of penicillin G (30 Mega/day) to the antibiotic regimen. Beginning ARDS in two of these patients dramatically responded to high-dose steroids. We conclude that St. mitis is a major pathogen in neutropenic leukemic patients. Infection appears to occur independently of acute leukemic cell type, regimen of selective gut decontamination, venous access, visible oral lesions or treatment with high-dose cytosine arabinoside. The clinical course of our patients raises questions about the value of commonly recommended empiric antibiotic regimens, which were clearly ineffective to control infections with St. mitis in this patient group. Our data indicate that immediate antibiotic therapy with penicillin G is indicated and may be life-saving for suspected St. mitis infections in neutropenic leukemic patients."

One-hundred and thirty-two isolates were characterized by: optochin susceptibility in ambient and CO(2)-enriched atmosphere; bile solubility; PCR-based assays targeting pneumococcal genes lytA, ply, pspA, cpsA, Spn9802, aliB-like ORF2, and a specific 16S rRNA region; multilocus sequence analysis; and antimicrobial susceptibility. By multilocus sequence analysis, 61 isolates were S. pseudopneumoniae, 34 were pneumococci, 13 were S. mitis, and 24 remained unclassified as non-pneumococci. Among S. pseudopneumoniae isolates, 51 (83.6%) were collected from respiratory tract samples; eight isolates were obtained from sterile sources. High frequency of non-susceptibility to penicillin (60.7%) and erythromycin (42.6%) was found. Only 50.8% of the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates displayed the typical optochin phenotype originally described for this species. None harbored the cpsA gene or the pneumococcal typical lytA restriction fragment length polymorphism. The Spn9802 and the specific 16S rRNA regions were detected among the majority of the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates (n = 59 and n = 49, respectively). The ply and pspA genes were rarely found. A high genetic diversity was found and 59 profiles were identified. Among the S. pneumoniae, 23 were capsulated and 11 were non-typeable. Three non-typeable isolates, associated to international non-capsulated lineages, were recovered from invasive disease sources. In conclusion, half of the atypical pneumococcal clinical isolates were, in fact, S. pseudopneumoniae and one-fourth were other streptococci. We identified S. pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable pneumococci as cause of disease in Spain including invasive disease."

The incidence of viridans streptococci cultured from the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was 15% (123/832), occurring within 15 days of bone marrow transplant in 78% of patients, usually during profound neutropenia. Strep. mitis was the most frequent isolate (47%). Only 27% (33/123) of patients were symptomatic beyond fever, usually with neurologic, pulmonary, and/or cardiovascular manifestations. Ten (8%) of 123 culture positive patients developed a fulminant cardiorespiratory collapse, with a 60% mortality. One additional death occurred due to cerebritis. However, a time dependent covariate analysis found no significant difference in overall mortality (p = 0.30) or duration of hospitalization (p = 0.50) in patients with or without viridans streptococci infections. A multivariate analysis revealed that age less than 18 years (RR = 1.5, p = 0.04) and a primary diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 1.5, p = 0.07) were independent and significant risk factors for viridans streptococci infections.

VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius. "

If micafungin is not effective against a fungal infection, is it unreasonable to switch to caspofungin? CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Asian man presented to our hospital with brain and lung abscesses. Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli were identified by sputa culture and Streptococcus mitis was identified in the brain abscess culture obtained by drainage surgery. He was treated with antibiotics and both abscesses shrank after the treatment. But he continued to have a high fever and Candida glabrata was identified by blood culture. The origin of the infection was not clarified and micafungin was administered intravenously. The fungus showed poor susceptibility to micafungin; we then switched the antifungal from micafungin to caspofungin. After caspofungin treatment, his body temperature remained below 37  C and his beta-D-glucan levels decreased remarkably. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, micafungin is considered more effective against C. glabrata because its minimum inhibitory concentration against C. glabrata is lower than that of caspofungin. However, in vivo, there is no significantly different effect between the two drugs. When micafungin is not effective against candidiasis, a switch to caspofungin might be applicable because the pharmacokinetics in each echinocandin is slightly different."

The goal of our study was to evaluate clinical course and microbiological susceptibility of VGS BSI at our center. Retrospective analysis of all microbiologically documented bloodstream infections caused by VGS during the 9-year time period (from January 2006 until December 2014) was carried out. Only patients with severe neutropenia (&lt; 500/muL) were included in the study. Clinical outcome and microbiological susceptibility pattern of isolates were recorded. Fifty-one individual patients with episode of VGS BSI were identified. The most frequent agent was Streptococcus mitis (23/51 cases, 45.1%). 88.2% (45/51) of patients were on recommended ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. 20/51 (39.2%) of patients suffered from mucositis at the time of diagnosis (10 patients had oral mucositis, 2 patients had bowel mucositis, and 8 patients both). Twenty-six patients (51.0%) had clinically relevant lung damage caused by VGS BSI (i.e., acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome). Twenty-four (47.0%) patients presented with bilateral lung infiltrated upon chest imaging, and two (4.0%) patients had unilateral lung infiltrates. Three patients (5.9%) died due to VGS BSI until day 28 of observation. No difference in signs of shock syndrome was observed in the patients during transplantation procedures compared to patients without transplantation as well as in a group received previous high-dose chemotherapy with cytosinarabinoside or in patients with mucositis. Only 3/51 of isolates (5.9%) were resistant to penicillin. All isolates were susceptible to empirical treatment. While the penicillin resistance of VGS remains low in middle Europe, initial antibiotic therapy of febrile neutropenia are still effective in most cases. The mortality and complication rates of VGS BSI were comparable to other studies, and no specific risk factor of shock presence could be identified."

Biopsy of the lesions revealed abscesses with detection of Streptococcus mitis. The child was successfully treated with antibiotics, finished chemotherapy per protocol and has been in complete remission for 14 months. Infectious lesions involving organs of typical metastatic dissemination can easily be misdiagnosed as metastases, especially in the absence of symptoms. Histologic proof of lesions suspicious of metastases is mandatory if it leads to a change of prognosis and therapy. Streptococcus mitis can be a causative organism of pulmonary and hepatic abscesses in oncological patients."

A month earlier, she had undergone catheter radiofrequency ablation for treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of her brain revealed septic emboli with multiple bilateral cerebral and cerebellar infarcts, as well as extensive bilateral leptomeningeal enhancement. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus mitis, Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Candida albicans, which suggested a connection between gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. A chest computed tomography scan with contrast showed a curvilinear low attenuation structure communicating between the esophagus and the left pulmonary vein-an atrioesophageal fistula. Ten days after admission, the patient died from multiple cerebral septic emboli secondary to atrioesophageal fistula following radiofrequency ablation."

The aim of the study was to clarify the bacterial etiologic diagnosis in infants with CAP. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional and descriptive study in patients 6 months to 2 years 11 months of age with CAP with poor outcome was conducted. Patients were admitted to the Pediatric Pneumology Service and underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), taking appropriate measures during the procedure to limit the risk of contamination. RESULTS: Aerobic bacteria isolated were Moraxella sp. 23%, Streptococcus mitis 23%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 18%, Haemophilus influenzae 12%, Streptococcus oralis 12%, and Streptococcus salivarius 12%. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other reports, we found Moraxella sp. to be a major bacterial pathogen, possibly because of improved detection with bronchoscopy plus BAL."

Observations: A 57-year old patient on CPAP presented with unilateral bleb-associated endophthalmitis 32 months after routine ExPress Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. The offending organism, Streptococcus mitis, is a nonmotile and generally non-virulent pathogen which predominates in the normal human respiratory flora. Conclusions and importance: This conceptual report underscores a potential relationship between CPAP use and bleb-associated endophthalmitis. Streptococcal species are the most commonly reported causative organisms in bleb-associated endophthalmitis, and S. mitis is of particular concern as the most abundant microbe among all human oral flora. A logical risk factor for infection, the CPAP device may inadvertently deliver such organisms to the vulnerable conjunctival filtering bleb."

A 28-year-old man presented with 2 months of persistent cough. He had a large lung abscess involving almost the entire right upper lobe. The mass continued to progress in spite of appropriate antibiotic administration. Given the extent of involvement, he was not a surgical candidate. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies demonstrated diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Initial cultures were positive for Group G Streptococci A CT-guided percutaneous drain was placed with initial purulent drainage that grew Prevotella and Streptococcus mitis; however, drainage quickly abated without adequate evacuation of the abscess cavity. To further optimise drainage in anticipation of chemotherapy administration, intracavitary fibrinolytic therapy including tissue plasminogen activator and deoxyribonuclease was attempted to better evacuate the infected space."

It is unusual for it to occur in structurally normal hearts or to cause recurrent symptoms after targeted antibiotics. Although guidelines suggest follow-up with repeat echocardiography and inflammatory marker surveillance, this case demonstrates that these are not always useful investigations, and instead imaging of the chest may be more appropriate. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 74-year-old man who presented with respiratory symptoms and was originally misdiagnosed with pneumonia but later found to have a large pulmonary valve vegetation caused by Streptococcus mitis. Despite initially responding to antibiotic therapy, the vegetation continued to cause pulmonary emboli and cavitating lung abscesses months later, necessitating pulmonary valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that pulmonary valve endocarditis can present atypically with recurrent respiratory symptoms, and in such cases, echocardiography should be considered to investigate for right-sided infective endocarditis. In addition, despite correct treatment, with normalization of inflammatory markers and improvement in vegetation size, infective endocarditis can continue to cause systemic symptoms. Finally, clinicians should consider chest computed tomography routinely as part of right-sided infective endocarditis follow-up."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus mitisID:31020138TITLE:A rare late finding in corrected tetralogy of Fallot: a case report.ABSTRACT:Introduction: Isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis is a rare phenomenon. Pulmonary prosthesis endocarditis is even more unusual, with only about 50 descriptions in worldwide literature, and its diagnosis and treatment is a challenge. Due to the increasing number of surgically corrected tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) patients, that often include pulmonary valve implantation, this clinical scenario is likely to become more frequent. Case presentation: We describe a 37-year-old man with a previously implanted biologic pulmonary prosthesis after a TOF correction that presented to the emergency department with new-onset fever, orthopnoea, and lower limb oedema. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus mitis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mobile mass in the right ventricular outflow tract, apparently originating from the pulmonary prosthesis. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed the presence of multiple mobile structures arising from the arterial surface of the prosthesis, extending into the right pulmonary artery and causing right ventricular obstruction. Antibiogram guided treatment was administered and surgery was performed, removing a 9 cm vegetation and replacing the valve. Patient recovered well and was discharged 35 days after. Discussion: In right-sided endocarditis, surgery indications and its timing are much less clear than in left-sided infections, but current literature describes it as associated with a significant morbidity, mortality, and high likelihood of requiring surgery. Large vegetations and clinical signs of haemodynamic impact should prompt consideration of early surgical intervention. The combination of transthoracic and TOE allowed a correct diagnosis and a timely treatment."

Echocardiography is regarded as the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of IE, and plays a key role in both the diagnosis and management of endocarditis. We report on a case in which one could have overlooked an endocarditis of a pulmonary homograft if one had relied on echocardiography alone. Case summary: A 38-year-old man presented with intermittent fever and fatigue for 1 month. He had undergone a Ross procedure for a bicuspid aortic valve stenosis at the age of 17 years. At the age of 36 years a valve-sparing aortic root replacement was performed because of aortic root dilatation. Besides a systolic murmur 3/6 noted at the left sternal border, physical examination was normal. Multiple blood cultures grew Streptococcus mitis. Both transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiogram could not detect any signs of endocarditis. As endocarditis can be overlooked due to reverberations and acoustic shadowing, we performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) and cardiac computed tomography angiogram (cardiac CTA). Both imaging modalities showed large vegetations attached to the pulmonary homograft. Discussion: Endocarditis poses diagnostic challenges. While echocardiography is the cornerstone of imaging, one may overlook a pulmonary homograft endocarditis due to reverberations and acoustic shadowing. Therefore, if clinical suspicion of endocarditis is strong, one should consider additional imaging by means of cardiac CTA and/or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging to assess valves in pulmonary position, especially in those whom have had prior surgical intervention at this location."

In elderly individuals, infective endocarditis can be difficult to diagnose and poses a challenge for the physician. The course of subacute infective endocarditis is indolent, and the onset of cardiac structural lesion is slow and gradual. In elderly patients, anemia and weight loss are occasionally the only or the most striking symptoms. In such cases, the clinical reasoning process leads to a hypothesis of wasting syndrome or neoplastic disease, especially when there is no fever. We report the case of an elderly patient who had mitral insufficiency due to degenerative valve disease and presented with bacterial endocarditis due to Streptococcus mitis. The patient was not treated, because the diagnosis was not established in a timely manner. It is of note that the patient presented with marked weight loss and no fever. The autopsy revealed impairment of the mitral valve and left atrium due to endocarditis, as well as lung involvement due to chronic inhalation of smoke from biomass burning, such as that produced by wood-burning stoves."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus mitisID:32968689TITLE:Normal Respiratory Flora as a Cause of Community-Acquired Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Background: Intensive studies have failed to identify an etiologic agent in >50% cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Bacterial pneumonia follows aspiration of recognized bacterial pathogens (RBPs) such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus after they have colonize the nasopharynx. We hypothesized that aspiration of normal respiratory flora (NRF) might also cause CAP. Methods: We studied 120 patients hospitalized for CAP who provided a high-quality sputum specimen at, or soon after admission, using Gram stain, quantitative sputum culture, bacterial speciation by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, and viral polymerase chain reaction. Thresholds for diagnosis of bacterial infection were >=105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL sputum for RBPs and >=106 cfu for NRF. Results: Recognized bacterial pathogens were found in 68 of 120 (56.7%) patients; 14 (20.1%) of these had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Normal respiratory flora were found in 31 (25.8%) patients; 10 (32.2%) had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Infection by >=2 RBPs occurred in 10 cases and by NRF together with RBPs in 13 cases. Among NRF, organisms identified as Streptococcus mitis, which share many genetic features of S pneumoniae, predominated. A respiratory virus alone was found in 16 of 120 (13.3%) patients. Overall, an etiologic diagnosis was established in 95.8% of cases. Conclusions: Normal respiratory flora, with or without viral coinfection, appear to have caused one quarter of cases of CAP and may have played a contributory role in an additional 10.8% of cases caused by RBPs. An etiology for CAP was identified in >95% of patients who provided a high-quality sputum at, or soon after, the time of admission."

A collection of 218 strains was investigated: 30 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 alpha-streptococci, and 68 strains representing other species. Strong crossreactions were observed with 36% of the alpha-streptococci and with two of 11 Staphylococcus aureus strains. The collection of alpha-streptococci consisted of 90 fresh clinical isolates and 30 stock strains. Almost all crossreactions of alpha-streptococci were found among the clinical isolates. Among the stock strains only one of four Streptococcus mitis strains was positive. Pneumococcal C-polysaccharide and phosphorylcholine inhibited the reactions in ELISA with monoclonal antibodies against pneumococcal C-polysaccharide, as well as with a polyclonal antiserum against pneumococcal C-polysaccharide. We suggest that the cross reactions between alpha-streptococci and pneumococci depend on the presence of phosphorylcholine as a common antigenic determinant. The crossreaction in the ELISA with some Staphylococcus aureus strains may be explained by the presence of protein A binding to the Fc portion of the antibodies. When the 10 alpha-streptococci that showed the strongest crossreactions and ten pneumococci representing different types were tested in different concentrations the absorbance values were lower for most alpha-streptococci compared with the pneumococci. This explains that false positive results with alpha-streptococci do not seem to constitute a practical problem in this ELISA developed for detection of pneumococcal C-polysaccharide in samples from patients with pneumonia."

The bacteremia may have contributed to the two deaths among these 13 patients. In 45 cases the viridans streptococci may have contributed to the patient's illness: 15 patients had an infection of the lower respiratory tract and 7 an infection of the upper respiratory tract, 8 were neonates with suspected septicemia, 3 had soft tissue infections, 3 had leukemia and sepsis, and 9 had miscellaneous infections; the bacteremia was unrelated to the two deaths in this group. In another 13 cases the viridans streptococci could not be related to the patient's illness. The species most frequently isolated were Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius. The outcome of the bacteremia was generally good, even among the 11 patients not treated with antibiotics. When viridans streptococci are cultured from a single blood sample, further samples of blood and, if feasible, specimens from the associated focus of infection should be obtained for culture; further blood cultures are especially important in cases of suspected endocarditis."

Complications related to the bacteremia were observed in 10 episodes: unilateral pulmonary infiltrates (4), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (4), hypotension (3), and endocarditis (2). All patients with ARDS had received high doses of cytosine arabinoside and had bacteremia due to Streptococcus mitis. Death occurred in three patients (12%) but was possibly related to bacteremia in only one case. Case patients who had received prophylaxis with quinolones were compared with matched control patients who received similar prophylaxis but who did not have bacteremia due to viridans streptococci. Multivariate analysis of predisposing factors showed that high doses of cytosine arabinoside (P = .01), the presence of mucositis (P = .02), and the absence of previous therapy with parenteral antibiotics (P = .01) were independent risk factors for the development of viridans streptococcal bacteremia. Of 259 patients who had received quinolone prophylaxis during the study period, 22 (8.5%) developed an episode of viridans streptococcal bacteremia as compared with three episodes (3.7%) in 82 patients who had received a quinolone and penicillin (P = .07). However, the latter three episodes were caused by strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, thus suggesting that resistance to penicillin might limit the use of this antibiotic as a prophylactic agent in the future."

More recently, however, these bacteria have become a major concern in neutropenic patients undergoing a chemotherapeutic treatment. In this high-risk population, they can be responsible for up to 39% of bacteremia cases and are the most frequent cause of this type of infection. The most frequently isolated species in blood cultures are Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II. Viridans streptococcus bacteremia can be accompanied by serious complications, like adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3% to 33%), shock (7% to 18%) or endocarditis (7% to 8%). Mortality rates range from 6% to 30%. Case-control studies have identified the following risk factors: severe neutropenia (&lt; 100 neutrophils/mm3), prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolone or co-trimoxazole, absence of intravenous antibiotics at the time of bacteremia, high doses of cytosine arabinoside, oropharyngeal mucositis, and heavy colonization by viridans streptococci. The introduction of penicillin in prophylactic antibiotic treatments has reduced the incidence of these infections, but the long-term use of penicillin could be compromised by the emergence of resistant strains."

A 48-year-old man with a past history of post-streptococcic aortic regurgitation was hospitalized twice within 1 week for fever (38 degrees C) and junctional tachycardia which responded to amiodarone. Subsequently, infero-apical necrosis was documented. Based on the result of the laboratory tests, coronary embolism was suspected although 12 blood cultures were negative. The patient recovered well with a standard antibiotic treatment. Fifteen days later, the blood cultures revealed Cardiobacterium hominis. Antibiotic therapy was adapted and aortic valve replacement was programmed. Two months later the patient died from uncontrollable left heart failure. A 63-year-old man who had had mitral valve replacement 10 years earlier for Streptococcus mitis endocarditis was hospitalized for fever (38 degrees C) and a painful left calf. Phlebocavography eliminated deep vein thrombosis and a complete cardiac work-up was inconclusive. Endocarditis was suspected although blood cultures were negative. The patient was given oral penicillin and discharged after one week. Three months later, the patient was again febrile (38 degrees C) and suffered a cerebral vascular event. Fourteen days after blood sampling, cultures revealed Cardiobacterium hominis. The patient's haemodynamic status worsened and valve replacement with atrioplasty was performed. Outcome after 4 years follow-up has been favourable. Endocarditis due to Cardiobacterium hominis, a saprophitic germ of the upper airway and the female genital tract, has been reported in 64 cases in the literature. The clinical picture is often limited to fever and a heart murmur and laboratory tests show an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hyperleukocytosis. Inflammatory type anaemia is often found due to the latency of the endocarditis. Complications are frequent and can be fatal due to massive pulmonary emboli, cerebral vascular events or irreversible heart failure. C. hominis is sensitive to amoxycillin and netilmicin.

During 166 consecutive treatment courses for leukemia, eight episodes of Streptococcus mitis septicemia were observed in 35 septicemic patients. In seven out of eight episodes (88%), severe mucositis developed after aggressive chemotherapy, suggesting that oral mucosa might be the site of entry for Streptococcus mitis. The isolates were sensitive to imipenam/cilastatin and cefuzonam, and were relatively resistant to amikacin. Although none of the patients died of Streptococcus mitis septicemia, life-threatening adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in two independent treatment courses.

METHODS: Isolates of S pneumoniae were cultured from specimens obtained from patients who had been admitted to a care of the elderly ward where an outbreak had occurred. Penicillin resistant S pneumoniae were also obtained from a series of surveillance throat swabs taken from patients in the same ward. In addition, all penicillin resistant S pneumoniae isolated from specimens submitted for culture at the time of the outbreak were included. Four sensitive strains isolated from a routine microbiology laboratory were included as controls. A simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based genotyping method for the penicillin binding protein (PBP) genes 1a, 2x, and 2b was used to characterise the genotypes. RESULTS: Nine patients were infected with serotype 9 S pneumoniae. Four of these patients died; two deaths were directly attributable to the infection. Tested against a battery of haemolytic streptococci and other organisms found in the respiratory tract, only two false positive reactions for PBP 2x were found among S mitis. The method demonstrated that the outbreak strain had altered PBP 1a, 2b, and 2x genes, a pattern clearly distinguishable from other penicillin resistant strains isolated at the same time. CONCLUSIONS: This method is simple to perform and would enable many laboratories to characterise the genotype of penicillin resistant S pneumoniae and investigate transmission in their hospitals."

METHODS: We analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. RESULTS: The most frequent causative organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), Escherichia coli (5 cases), and Streptococcus mitis (3 cases). Overall, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (P&lt; .001). Thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. All strains of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. Forty-seven percent of streptococcal strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/mL). Five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. Attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both P. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci."

CLINICAL PICTURE: We report a case of thoracic empyema due to Gemella morbillorum in an elderly Chinese male who had been having symptoms for 3 months and no response to multiple courses of antibiotics. INTERVENTION: The collection was drained with ultrasound guidance. OUTCOME: Drainage of the empyema produced rapid resolution of symptoms and no antibiotics were started. CONCLUSIONS: Gemella is a very rare cause of empyema which usually responds well to treatment.

The case is reported of Gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis, which was associated with an underlying colonic carcinoma. An association with colonic neoplasm has been described in three previous cases of endocarditis attributed to Gemella. It is well documented that Streptococcus bovis endocarditis may occur in the setting of colonic neoplasia.

It is considered a member of the normal upper respiratory tract flora including the oropharynx and also the gastro-intestinal and female genital tract. However severe infections are reported like endocarditis, septic shock and septic arthritis, more often in immunocompromised hosts. It is an infrequently isolated organism and a rare cause of pulmonary or pleural infections. CASE REPORT: We report a case of necrotizing pneumonia due to Gemella morbillorum in a 45-years-old Melanesian, smoker patient. The presentation was subacute with a four month history of loss of appetite, progressive weight loss and cough without fever. Initial presentation seems to be a malignant disease. The positive diagnosis has been established on the results of BAL fluid and the protected specimen brush samples. It was an immunocompetent patient presenting dental inflammation but not oral infection. Further management included intravenous administration of amoxicillin during two weeks. We recommended oral antibiotic treatment for another six weeks. After two months the patient was reevaluated. The CT scan showed no evidence of persistent infection. The HR CT scan will reveal multiple kystic bronchiectasies not seen on the first CT scan. CONCLUSION: Gm can be found endoscopic samples.

CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case reported of a 28-year-old Chinese male with endocarditis caused by pulmonary valve infection of Gemella morbillorum associated with congenital ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect and double-chambered right ventricle. The patient presented with fever, shortness of breath, progressively worsening exertional fatigue, dyspnea and weight loss for 3 months. The diagnosis was made with transthoracic echocardiogram, blood cultures, and post-operative pathology. The patient developed congestive heart failure and was managed with aggressive antibiotic therapy followed by surgery. He underwent replacement of the pulmonary valve with an aortic bioprosthetic valve, repair of ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect, reconstruction of the right ventricular outlflow tract, and excision of vegetations. His postoperative recovery was uneventful. No bacteria were isolated from the excised tissues. He was asymptomatic without recurrence at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The rare pathogen such as Gemella morbillorum can be the cause of infective endocarditis and timely surgical repair is necessary if the infection is refractory or there is progression of congestive heart failure under antibiotic cover."

G. morbillorum is a commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract; it gained access to the bloodstreams in these patients, and bacteremia occurred. A clinical drawback is that the initial colonial morphology of this organism leads to presumptive identification as a viridans streptococcus, an organism not commonly associated with septic shock syndrome.

We diagnosed tricuspid valve endocarditis in two elderly nonaddicted patients with recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, anemia, and microscopic hematuria that occurred during several months and was caused by Gemella morbillorum and Candida glabrata, respectively. We have reviewed 27 other cases of nonaddicted patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis from the literature and discussed etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcome. Mean age was 53.5 years (range, 22 to 74 years old), and 72% had underlying medical conditions. Staphylococcus oureus, Streptococcus bovis, and candida species were the causative organisms in 70% of the cases. Average duration of infection before diagnosis was 9.3 months. We conclude that isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis in nonaddicted patients occurs mainly in the middle-aged and older persons, mimicking chronic illness and community-acquired pneumonia. In the absence of a history of intravenous drug use, diagnostic delays are common. We suggest that right-sided endocarditis must be considered in any patient with the ""Tricuspid Syndrome,"" consisting of recurrent pulmonary events, anemia, and microscopic hematuria. Careful evaluation of prior medical records and clinical course can be very helpful. Echocardiography and serial blood cultures provide the key to diagnosis."

They are responsible for 40-60% of the endocarditis cases occurring on the normal valves, especially in male patients and over 45 years of age. A change in the bacterial flora of the oral cavity is taking part after orthodontic fixed appliances are introduced into the oral cavity, change that is associated with an increased concentration of the acidogenic bacteria. Bacteraemia is the consequence of oral cavity infections, the association of infective endocarditis with fixed orthodontic appliance, as it has been described by us for the first time, caused by Abiotrophia defectiva. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female Caucasian patient, aged 22 years, who developed infective endocarditis with Streptococcus viridans associated with fixed orthodontic appliance, located on the mitral valve, without previous cardiac pathology, and the therapeutic difficulties associated with allergic reactions (to vancomycin, and spironolactone). DIAGNOSES: Repetitive haemocultures were positive with Streptococcus viridans, while transthoracic echography revealed a severe mitral failure through anteromedial segment of the anterior mitral valve leaf prolapse with eccentric jet to the posterior wall. INTERVENTIONS: During hospitalization, the decision to undergo surgical intervention was taken after obtaining negative haemocultures. The patient underwent surgically intervention, and a mitral valve plasty with insertion of neochords was performed. OUTCOMES: Intraoperative and subsequently post-discharge transesophageal echography, highlighted normofunctional mitral plasty with a remaining regurgitation grade I-II of IV, with good openness, minor tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. LESSONS: Endocarditis with oral streptococci associated with fixed orthodontic appliance seems to be not so unlikely even in young or without previous cardiac pathology patients, requiring attention in identifying possible pre-existing cardiac conditions like mitral valve prolapse with clinical and echographic monitoring of such cases. Educating and motivating the patient to observe the oral hygiene represent key steps for an optimal oral health during orthodontic treatment. Mechanical tooth cleaning helps maintaining a good oral hygiene during fixed orthodontics and decreasing the oral health risks."

The pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae), an important human pathogen, is traditionally distinguished from the most closely related oral streptococcal species Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis on the basis of three differentiating characteristics: optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination with antipneumococcal polysaccharide capsule antibodies. However, there are many reports in the literature of pneumococci lacking one or more of these defining characteristics. Sometimes called ""atypical"" pneumococci, these isolates can be the source of considerable confusion in the clinical laboratory. Little is known to date about the genetic relationships of such organisms with classical S. pneumoniae isolates. Here we describe these relationships based on sequence analysis of housekeeping genes in comparison with previously characterized isolates of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis, and S. oralis. While most pneumococci were found to represent a closely related group these studies identified a subgroup of atypical pneumococcal isolates (bile insoluble and/or ""acapsular"") distinct from, though most closely related to, the ""typical"" pneumococcal isolates. However, a large proportion of isolates, found to be atypical on the basis of capsule reaction alone, did group with typical pneumococci, suggesting that they have either lost capsule production or represent as-yet-unrecognized capsular types. In contrast to typical S. pneumoniae, isolates phenotypically identified as S. mitis and S. oralis, which included isolates previously characterized in taxonomic studies, were genetically diverse. While most of the S. oralis isolates did fall into a well-separated group, S. mitis isolates did not cluster into a well-separated group. During the course of these studies we also identified a number of potentially important pathogenic isolates, which were frequently associated with respiratory disease, that phenotypically and genetically are most closely related to S. mitis but which harbor genes encoding the virulence determinants pneumolysin and autolysin classically associated with S. pneumoniae."

They concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. These patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). Seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. During 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. In six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). Most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten Streptococcus mitis, five S. oralis, two S. sanguis, three S. pneumoniae). A single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The enterococci were one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium. Ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L of penicillin G, ten were less susceptible (0.5 &lt; or = MIC &lt; 32 mg/L), and a strain was resistant (MIC = 32 mg/L). Eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. For three strains, the MICs of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/L and 8-32 mg/L, respectively) were higher. Levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. All species were susceptible to glycopeptides. Three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. Their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. This results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients."

Linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. Linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, after screening &gt;40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. METHODS: During 2001-2002, 8 resistant strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating SENTRY institutions in the US were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus oralis. Resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated MICs (&gt; or =8 microg/mL) and small inhibitory zone diameters (&lt; or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone AZD2563. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. All enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (S. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. E. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002. Resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. Clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. Longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions."

METHODS: The adenoids from 10 patients who were undergoing adenoidectomy for either hypertrophy or recurrent otitis media were used. RESULTS: Streptococcus oralis Parker and S. oralis Booth (two organisms isolated from the nasopharynges of patients undergoing adenoidectomy only and patients undergoing adenoidectomy and bilateral tympanostomy with tubes, respectively) uniformly inhibited both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Although both strains of S. oralis inhibited the growth of both S. pneumoniae strains, strain Parker provided more complete inhibition than did strain Booth. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that some strains of S. oralis may inhibit the growth of the most serious pathogens in the nasopharynx. It is therefore possible that colonization of inhibitory strains of viridans streptococci may be used in the nasopharynx as a relatively safe and inexpensive approach to prevention of recurrent otitis media in some children and of recurrent suppurative sinusitis in both children and adults."

After a bout of respiratory tract infection, she was diagnosed to have bacterial endocarditis associated with mitral valve disease. The causative agents isolated included Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides bivius. At the same time, the patient was found to have developed IgA immunodeficiency. A complication accompanying the cardiac disease was spontaneous pneumothorax. Since antibiotic therapy had failed, the mitral valve was replaced by a prosthetic one. After the procedure, the patient had her teeth examined. The examination revealed complete destruction of tooth 36, thick layers of calculus and chronic gingivitis. E. corrodens was isolated also after microbiological examination of the patient's oral cavity. The reason for reporting on what we regard as an interesting case is that bacterial endocarditis with E. corrodens implicated as the causative agent is relatively rare; to date, polymicrobial endocarditis due to E. corrodens and other microorganisms has been described in intravenous drug addicts only."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the NRL from different regions of the Czech Republic. Generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the Quellung reaction. Since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay has been introduced. The novel assay was tested on 210 S. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species S. pseudopneumoniae, S. sanguinis, and S. oralis. RESULTS: The NRL for Streptococcal Infections has included a novel mPCR assay in the algorithm of S. pneumoniae identification and typing. The mPCR assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the isolates of the related species remaining negative. The mPCR assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. The pCR appeared to be an excellent tool for S. pneumoniae typing. CONCLUSION: Until recently, S. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (Quellung reaction), but the NRL for Streptococcal Infections has switched to a novel mPCR assay. This molecular tool improves S. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate."

VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius. "

In one child, stroke occurred in the context of acute infection with Mycoplasma pneumonia. In another child, stroke occurred in the context of Streptococcus oralis (viridans subgroup) infection. In two other children, stroke occurred in the context of a bibasilar pneumonia for which an etiologic agent was not found. All patients had evidence of selective IgG4 subclass deficiency. We followed 8 other children with down syndrome with infectious diseases, but without stroke and a control group of healthy children, and measured the value of IgG4 for each group. We found a statistical significant difference of levels of IgG4 subclass deficiency in the group of stroke, in comparison with the other two groups (P values &lt;0.001). We, therefore, suggest an association between IgG4 subclass deficiency and stroke in DS patients. IgG4 subclass deficiency could conceivably play a role in the high frequency of para-infectious related stroke in this population. "

The patient did not have an associated murmur, which is commonly seen in right-sided infectious endocarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a thickened PV leaflet, with subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram showing a PV mass. Speciation of blood cultures revealed Streptococcus oralis. In right-sided infective endocarditis, usually the tricuspid valve is involved; however, in our case the tricuspid valve was free of any mass or vegetation. The patient did meet Duke criteria and was thus started on long-term intravenous antibiotics for infectious endocarditis. The patient's symptoms quickly improved with antibiotics. A careful history and evaluating the patient's risk factors are key in earlier detection of infective endocarditis (IE). Because of early detection and a high index of suspicion, the patient had no further complications and did not require any surgery. In conclusion, clinical suspicion of right-sided IE should be high in patients who present with persistent fevers and pulmonary symptoms in order to reduce the risk of complications, and to improve outcomes.

More than 80% of children under three years of age experience at least one episode, and about one-third of these report significant recurrence of episodes. In recent years, several studies reported that normal nasopharyngeal flora inhibits growth of common otopathogens, suggesting that maintenance of an ""adequate"" nasopharyngeal flora might prevent occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections, including AOM. This study aims to determine whether five-month treatment with Streptococcus salivarius 24SMB and Streptococcus oralis 89a nasal spray prevents recurrence of AOM and prescription of antibiotics in children with diagnosis of recurrent AOM. METHODS: Observational prospective cohort study including children aged 1-6 years with diagnosis of recurrent AOM registered with 31 Italian family pediatricians. 81 children were enrolled in the study from September 2016 to the end of the five therapeutic cycles of the Streptococcus salivarius 24SMB and Streptococcus oralis 89a supplied 7 days each month for 5 consecutive months. For each treated child, one untreated control was randomly selected, 1:1 matched for gender, age, and follow-up. RESULTS: 158 children (79 treated and 70 untreated) were included into the analysis (mean age, 3.9 years; 47% female). Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant 34% (95% CI 1%-56%) reduction in number of AOM episodes in treated children compared with those not treated. Significantly fewer antibiotics were dispensed among treated children (24%, 95% CI 1%-41%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intermittent treatment of children with diagnosis of recurrent AOM with nasal spray containing Streptococcus salivarius 24SMB and Streptococcus oralis 89a for a period of five months might be effective in preventing antibiotic use associated with recurrent episodes of AOM. Additional larger studies to address this important clinical problem are recommended."

In this study, we set out to verify the frequency, usefulness, and costs of blood cultures in RSV infections. We addressed the issue by reviewing medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days-121 months, who were hospitalized during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57 patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10 cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1; Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1; Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to $1980. If performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached $5490. In conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection, with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus, blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children hospitalized due to RSV infection."

Conventional laboratory methods may sometimes fail to identify S. pneumoniae. The aims of this study were i) to compare the conventional methods and molecular methods which detected pneumococcal surface antigen A (psaA) and autolysin (lytA) genes; ii) to determine the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae isolated from the respiratory samples. Randomly chosen 62 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from respiratory samples of patients with clinically proven pneumococcal pneumonia (age range: 1-79 years) between years 2000-2006, were included in the study. Classical microbiological analysis for the isolates included Gram staining, optochin sensitivity test performed in 5% CO2 and ambient air and bile solubility test. Capsular serotyping was performed by using latex particles sensitized with mono-specific typing sera (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark). Quellung reaction (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) was used for serotyping the isolates that gave equivocal results using latex agglutination. Pneumococcal surface antigen A and autolysin genes were detected by in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using psaA1 (5'-CTT TCT GCA ATC ATT CTT G), psaA2 (5'-GCC TTC TTT ACC TTG TTC TGC), lytAF (5'-ACG CAA TCT AGC AGA TGA AGC) and lytAR (5'-TGT TTG GTT GGT TAT TCG TGC) primers. Twenty six different serotypes were detected in 62 S. pneumoniae isolates. The most prevalent capsule serotype was 14 (n= 6), followed by 19A (n= 5). Four isolates could not be typed by the available antisera. All the isolates were optochin sensitive with or without carbondioxide incubation and were bile soluble. All the isolates included in the study have harboured (100%) psaA and lytA genes. No difference was found between the classical and molecular methods for the identification of S. pneumoniae isolates. In conclusion, detection of psaA and/or lytA genes by molecular methods is of value especially in ""nonserotypeable strains"" when they are performed with conventional methods in clinically proven S. pneumoniae isolates."

It has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens including anaerobes and intracellular organisms, as well as strains resistant to beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics. For relevant respiratory pathogens, MXF attains the threshold values of pharmacodynamic indices predictive of clinical efficacy and minimization of resistance development. On the other hand, due to its limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it is less suitable for 'late-onset' nosocomial infections. In clinical trials, it has been found to be at least as effective and safe as comparators, while often showing higher bacteriological success rates. In some randomized studies MXF has shown superiority over comparator regimens in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. A consistent observation in many clinical trials of respiratory tract infections is the early onset of effect and a faster resolution of symptoms compared with standard therapy, possibly resulting from its fast distribution into tissue and high bactericidal activity leading to more rapid bacterial eradication. Although originally developed for respiratory tract infections, MXF over the years as been shown to be effective, and consequently received approval for additional indications."

Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components--emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment."

Study participants included 46 children hospitalized from July 2009 to January 2010. Infection with the virus was confirmed using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The epidemic month was October 2009; 34 patients were boys, and median age was 7 years. Pandemic influenza-associated respiratory diseases included pneumonia (n = 42), bronchitis (n = 3), and pharyngitis (n = 1). The median time from onset to admission was 3 days. Children were divided into those with severe (n = 32) versus nonsevere illnesses (n = 14) according to Japanese guidelines. Significant features in the severe group were younger age, previous asthmatic attack, exacerbation of asthma, decreased oxygen saturation, elevated white blood cell/neutrophil counts and serum lactate dehydrogenase, and longer times from admission to being afebrile and discharged. Both groups showed lymphopenia at admission. Additional infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae was frequent in the severe group. Whereas 44 patients received antiviral therapy (median times from onset to initiation 2 days), 32 received antibiotics (median duration 7 days). All children recovered, with a median hospital stay of 8 days. Our observations suggest that history of asthma and preschool age might be risk factors for severe illness. Prompt initiation of antiviral and antibiotic treatments should be considered to prevent development of severe illness."

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of all medical records of children from infancy to 60 months of age seen in our specialty clinic from 1999 to 2009 with protracted cough, wheeze, and/or noisy breathing in whom BAL found &gt;= 10(4) colony forming units per milliliter of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Children with other major diagnoses were excluded. RESULTS: With quantitative culture from BAL, &gt;= 10(4) colony forming units per milliliter of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, or Moraxella catarrhalis, separately or in combination, were found in 70 children. Neutrophilia was present in 87% of BALs. Tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, or both was present in 52 children (74%). Symptoms were eliminated with antibiotics in all 61 children with follow-up data. Relapse and subsequent successful re-treatment occurred in 43 children. CONCLUSIONS: High colony counts of potentially pathogenic bacteria associated with neutrophilia in the BAL identifies protracted bacterial bronchitis. The predominance of airway malacia in these patients suggests an etiologic role for those airway anomalies. The potential for chronic airway damage from protracted bacterial bronchitis warrants further investigation."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 155 patient isolates of S. pneumoniae were collected between February 2003 and December 2009 from the Iasi ""Sf. Parascheva"" Infectious Diseases Hospital. Susceptibility to antibiotics was assessed by disk diffusion method (CLSI 2003-2008); minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to penicillin and cefotaxime were determined by broth dilution method or E-test method. RESULTS: Of these isolates, 32.6% were penicillin non-susceptible (MIC &gt; or = 0.12 microg/mL for nonmeningeal isolates before 2008 and all meningeal isolates and MIC &gt; or =2 microg/mL for nonmeningeal isolates after 2008). The percentage of penicillin resistance increased from 0% to a maximum of 50% in 2008. Resistance rates (intermediate and resistant strains) among non-beta-lactam agents were as follows: macrolides, 30.9%; clindamycin, 9%; tetracycline, 34.3%; chloramphenicol, 2.1%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 57.5%. No resistance to vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin was observed. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics was higher among penicillin-resistant strains than penicillin-susceptible strains. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was higher among isolates from respiratory tract comparing with isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and blood. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance rates with S. pneumoniae have markedly increased in Romania during the last years. Pneumococcal isolates from lasi, Romania are often resistant to beta-lactams and available non-beta-lactam agents, especially if penicillin non-susceptible."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  SUBJECTS: 70 children aged one month - five years, admitted to the above mentioned pediatrics hospitals in Bucharest, who were negative for the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and the human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) by Reverse Transcription -Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). 48 of them presented pneumonia upon admission to hospital, 6--acute bronchiolitis and 16 respiratory viral infections. Samples (nasal swabs) were taken from patients and introduced in viral transport medium. DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: RT-PCR for RSV and hMPV, Multiplex PCR by seeplex multi-detection system with Seeplex RV/PB 18 ASE Detection for detection of 5 pneumonial bacteria and Real-Time PCR, Duplica Real Time Adenovirus Detection for ADV. RESULTS: Of the total 70 patients negative for RSV, hMPV and 5 pneumonial bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila), 10 were ADV positive; none of the children &lt; 6 months (N = 16) presented ADV infection. In the 6 months - 2 years group (N = 35), 6 were ADV positive. In the 2 - 5 years group (N = 19), 4 were ADV positive. CONCLUSIONS: The percent of ADV infections in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARI) caused by neither RSV or hMPV is 14.2%. ADV is most frequently encountered in the 6 months - 2 years and then 2 - 5 years groups, but the most severe pneumonia forms can be seen in the 6 months - 2 years group. In children &lt; 6 months with acute bronchiolitis ADV was not found to be an etiologic agent."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:22894879TITLE:Epidemiology and outcome of severe pneumococcal pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit: a multicenter study.ABSTRACT:INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) account for a high proportion of ICU admissions, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the main pathogen responsible for these infections. However, little is known on the clinical features and outcomes of ICU patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The aims of this study were to provide epidemiological data and to determine risk factors of mortality in patients admitted to ICU for severe S. pneumoniae CAP. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of two prospectively-acquired multicentre ICU databases (2001-2008). Patients admitted for management of severe pneumococcal CAP were enrolled if they met the 2001 American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia, had life-threatening organ failure and had a positive microbiological sample for S. pneumoniae. Patients with bronchitis, aspiration pneumonia or with non-pulmonary pneumococcal infections were excluded. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty two patients were included, with a median SAPS II score reaching 47 [36-64]. Acute respiratory failure (n = 154) and septic shock (n = 54) were their most frequent causes of ICU admission. Septic shock occurred in 170 patients (77%) and mechanical ventilation was required in 186 patients (84%); renal replacement therapy was initiated in 70 patients (32%). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7%. Although antibiotherapy was adequate in 92.3% of cases, hospital mortality reached 28.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were age (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08)), male sex (OR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.16-6.91)) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.78 (95% CI: 1.71-8.36)). Co-morbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, mortality of pneumococcal CAP remains high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Baseline demographic data and renal replacement therapy have a major impact on adverse outcome."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:22911476TITLE:Bacterial bronchitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae in children: the impact of vaccination.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Protracted bacterial bronchitis is a major cause of persistent cough in childhood. The organisms most commonly isolated are nontypable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae . There are no studies addressing typing of these organisms when recovered from the lower airways. METHODS: Isolates of these two organisms (identified in BAL samples from children undergoing routine investigation of a chronic cough thought to be attributable to a protracted bacterial bronchitis) were subject to typing. Samples were collected in Sheffield, England, and Athens, Greece. The majority of the children from Sheffield had received pneumococcal-conjugate vaccines 7 or 13 (PCV-7 or PCV-13) conjugate vaccine but only a minority of Greek children had received PCV-7. RESULTS: All 18 S pneumoniae isolates from Greek BAL samples are serotypes contained in PCV-13 while 10 are contained in PCV-7. In contrast, 28 of the 39 samples from Sheffield contained serotypes that are not included in PCV-13. All 26 of the nontypable H influenzae samples obtained in Sheffield produced distinct multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis profiles. There was a significant difference between children from Athens and Sheffield in the distribution of serotypes contained or not contained in the pneumococcal vaccine ( P = .04). More specifically, immunization with pneumococcal vaccine was related with isolation of S pneumoniae serotypes not included in the vaccine (OR, 0.021; CI, 0.003-0.115; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that both vaccine and nonvaccine S pneumoniae serotypes may play a role in protracted bacterial bronchitis and provide some hints that serotype replacement may occur in response to the introduction of conjugate vaccines."

Case report and review of literature.ABSTRACT:Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare condition in middle-aged women with a history of uterine leiomyomata. It is  characterized by the proliferation of, usually multiple, smooth muscle nodules. Approximately 100 cases have been reported  in the literature, and the lungs were the most common site of metastases.  We report a case of 52-year-old obese woman (BMI 31), hospital worker, smoker, admitted to the hospital with exertional  dyspnoea, night sweats, loss of weight, and productive cough.  Hysterectomy for a uterine leiomyoma was performed 9 years earlier. In addition, a history of two episodes of superficial  vein thrombosis 3 and 2 years before admission was noted. Chest X-ray and subsequently CT chest examinations revealed  multiple, non-calcified nodules within the middle and lower parts of both lungs. Specimens obtained by transbronchial  biopsy (TBLB) and from open lung biopsy displayed benign muscle cell proliferation compatible with BML. The levels of sex  hormones were characteristic for the menopause; therefore, observation was advised. Additionally, Streptococcus  pneumoniae was cultured from bronchial washing, and bronchitis was diagnosed. Antibiotics, bronchodilators, and  mucolytics were administered, and dyspnoea and cough with expectoration were diminished. Two years later pulmonary  lesions have been stable; however, she has put on weight. Subsequently the patient has developed deep vein thrombosis  with pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulant treatment was introduced, with some improvement."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:23163186TITLE:The bacteriology of lower respiratory infections in Papua New Guinean and Australian indigenous children.ABSTRACT:Indigenous children in Australia and children in Papua New Guinea (PNG) share a high burden of respiratory disease. In PNG the focus has been on pneumonia as a major cause of mortality. While pneumonia incidence remains high in Australian Indigenous children, improved access to better health care has resulted in reduced mortality. However, severe and recurrent pneumonia are risk factors for chronic suppurative lung disease or bronchiectasis in Australian Indigenous children. Bronchiectasis is associated with significant morbidity, and early death in adulthood. This paper includes an outline of the disease manifestations of acute and chronic lower respiratory infections. The main bacterial pathogens involved in pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis and bronchiectasis have been determined. Capsular organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b are more often implicated in acute infections, while chronic infections are frequently associated with nontypeable (noncapsular) H. influenzae. Moraxella catarrhalis is more often isolated from very young children. Possible reasons for the high burden of respiratory disease in Papua New Guinean children and Australian Indigenous (primarily Aboriginal) children include early and dense colonization with multiple species and strains of respiratory pathogens. There is a role for vaccines in preventing lower respiratory infection."

They have long been detected together in a multispecies biofilm in infected tissue. However, an understanding of their interplay is a recent field of study, and while over recent years, there has been research that has identified many specific elements important in these biofilms, to date, it remains questionable whether the relationship between H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae is competitive or cooperative. Additionally, the factors that govern the nature of the interspecies interaction are still undefined. This review aims to collate the information that has emerged on the cocolonization and co-infection by S. pneumoniae and nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) and their formation of a multispecies biofilm."

Of 414 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 407 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 64, Streptococcus pneumoniae 96, Haemophilus influenzae 87, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 52, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 20, and Moraxella catarrhalis 44. Of 64 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 27 (42.2%) and 37 (57.8%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, vancomycin and linezolid showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (45.8%) and clindamycin (20.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (50.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 49.2% and 28.1% of all the respiratory infections, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (29.2%), S. aureus (20.8%), and H. influenzae (12.9%). H. influenzae (25.0%) and P. aeruginosa (21.7%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the antibacterial agent administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (27.5%) and H. influenzae (22.5%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides was P. aeruginosa, and its isolation frequently was 39.4%."

However, no studies have performed molecular sequencing of HAdVs from the lower airways of children with chronic endobronchial suppuration. We thus examined the major HAdV genotypes/species, and relationships to bacterial coinfection, in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and mild bronchiectasis (BE). METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 245 children with PBB or mild (cylindrical) BE were included in this prospective cohort study. HAdVs were genotyped (when possible) in those whose BAL had HAdV detected (HAdV(+)). Presence of bacterial infection (defined as &gt;=10(4) colony-forming units/mL) was compared between BAL HAdV(+) and HAdV negative (HAdV(-)) groups. Immune function tests were performed including blood lymphocyte subsets in a random subgroup. RESULTS: Species C HAdVs were identified in 23 of 24 (96%) HAdV(+) children; 13 (57%) were HAdV-1 and 10 (43%) were HAdV-2. An HAdV(+) BAL was significantly associated with bacterial coinfection with Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio [OR], 3.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-7.75; P = .007) and negatively associated with Staphylococcus aureus infection (P = .03). Young age was related to increased rates of HAdV(+). Blood CD16 and CD56 natural killer cells were significantly more likely to be elevated in those with HAdV (80%) compared with those without (56.1%) (P = .027). CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-C is the major HAdV species detected in the lower airways of children with PBB and BE. Younger age appears to be an important risk factor for HAdV(+) of the lower airways and influences the likelihood of bacterial coinfection."

Unlike in adults, these abscesses are difficult to diagnose in small children, and can rapidly develop into deep neck or mediastinal abscesses. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old Japanese boy recently presented to our department with a chief complaint of neck swelling. Physical examination revealed bilateral tonsillitis and swelling of the left posterior pharyngeal wall. Emergency neck computed tomography angiography showed a contrast-enhanced abscess cavity posterior to the left retropharyngeal space, and a low-density area surrounded by an area without contrast enhancement in the posterior neck. The latter was suspected to be a deep neck infection secondary to a retropharyngeal abscess. After surgery, the patient was diagnosed with a retropharyngeal abscess and concurrent cystic lymphangioma. The lesions improved after intraoral incision and drainage, and administration of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Lymphangiomas and retropharyngeal abscesses are both known to be more common in children than in adults. However, we found no other reports of concomitant presentation of lymphangioma and retropharyngeal abscess in the literature."

This study assessed clinical cure rates in azithromycin-treated subjects with CARTI caused by azithromycin-susceptible (Azi-S) or azithromycin-resistant (Azi-R) SPN. METHODS: 1127 subjects with CARTI (402 acute otitis media, 309 community-acquired pneumonia, 255 acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and 161 acute bacterial sinusitis) in 13 Phase 3 clinical trials (1993-2007) had a confirmed pathogen, received azithromycin and were assessed for clinical cure/failure. 34.4% of subjects (388/1127) had a positive culture for SPN; 33.4% (376/1127) had Azi-S or Azi-R SPN. RESULTS: 28.9% (112/388) of subjects with SPN had Azi-R SPN: 35.7% (40/112) were low-level Azi-R SPN (LLAR; MIC 2-8 mg/L), while 64.3% (72/112) were high-level Azi-R SPN (HLAR; MIC &gt;=16 mg/L). Among Azi-S and Azi-R SPN CARTI subjects, clinical cure rates were: 86.2% (324/376) overall; 89.4% (236/264) for subjects with Azi-S SPN; 78.6% (88/112) for subjects with Azi-R SPN (P = 0.003, versus Azi-S); 77.5% (31/40) for subjects with LLAR SPN (P &lt; 0.001); and 79.2% (57/72) for subjects with HLAR SPN (P = 0.122). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical cure rates in CARTI subjects treated with azithromycin were higher for Azi-S SPN (89.4%) versus Azi-R SPN (78.6%; P = 0.003). However, cure rates were not different for subjects infected with LLAR-SPN versus HLAR-SPN. At the observed prevalence of Azi-R SPN of 28.9%, an additional 3.1 clinical failures would be predicted, as a consequence of azithromycin resistance (LLAR and HLAR), per 100 subjects treated empirically with azithromycin."

The study group included 18 patients with a diagnosis of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma or renal angiomyolipoma related to TSC. The median duration of therapy was 15 months. All clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities including complete blood count, fasting lipid profile, glucose level, and liver and kidney function tests were analyzed as potential AEs. The most common AEs of everolimus therapy were laboratory abnormalities (100% of patients) and infection complications (83 episodes in 15 patients). Infectious episodes of pharyngitis (67%), diarrhea (44%), stomatitis (39%), and bronchitis (39%) were the most common infections. They were mostly mild or moderate in severity (grade 1-2). In two cases, life-threatening conditions related to mTOR inhibitor treatment were encountered. The first was classified as grade 4 pleuropneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis, whereas the second was classified as death related to AE (grade 5) Escherichia coli sepsis. The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypercholesterolemia (13/18 patients - 72%) and hypertriglyceridemia (12/18 patients - 66%). Neutropenia (12/18 patents - 66%) and anemia (8/18 patients - 44%) were the most common hematologic toxicities. Everolimus treatment in TSC patients may lead to life-threatening outcomes, including sepsis and death. Long-lasting effects of everolimus treatment in the context of high incidences of different laboratory abnormalities found in TSC patients are another subject that should be researched further. "

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:25917807TITLE:Recurrent, protracted and persistent lower respiratory tract infection: A neglected clinical entity.ABSTRACT:Community-acquired pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening disease affecting children worldwide. Recurrent pneumonia episodes can lead to the development of chronic respiratory morbidity. Chronic wet cough, a common pediatric complaint, is defined as a wet cough indicating excessive airway mucus that lasts for a minimum of 4 weeks. Most children with a chronic wet cough do not suffer from underlying debilitating pulmonary disorders. Rather, chronic wet cough is generally associated with neutrophilic airway inflammation and bacterial infections of the conducting airways. Failure to characterize endobronchial infections has led to under-recognition of chronic wet cough as an important clinical entity in children. Under-recognition and under-treatment of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), a diagnosis made by the presence of isolated cough &gt;4 weeks that resolves with appropriate antibiotic treatment, may lead to the development of chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis. The burden of bronchiectasis is highest in developing countries and in specifically vulnerable populations in developed countries, in particular indigenous children living in remote communities. The incidence, hospitalization rates and risk of long term sequelae of childhood pneumonia in indigenous children are higher than in non-indigenous children residing in the same area. The overlapping clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis are the presence of a chronic wet cough, impaired mucociliary clearance of the conducting airways, the presence of endobronchial bacterial infection (mainly non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis) and neutrophilic airway inflammation. The principles of managing PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis are the same. More research and public health interventions are required to improve the awareness, diagnosis and management of these causes of chronic wet cough in children. "

Acute purulent pericarditis is an uncommon complication of S. pneumoniae in the antibiotic era. A healthy 4-year-old girl was admitted with pneumonia and pleural effusion. She had received one catch-up dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at 2 years of age. She rapidly developed necrotizing pneumonia, complicated by bronchopleural fistula presenting as subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax and acute purulent pericarditis. S. pneumoniae serotype 19A was subsequently identified from blood, empyema and pericardial fluid cultures. After appropriate antibiotic therapy and a right lower lobectomy, her condition stabilized and she promptly recovered. This case highlights two rare potential clinical complications of pneumococcal disease in a child: necrotizing pneumonia and acute purulent pericarditis. This is the first report of a child who received just one catch-up dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at 2 years of age, as per the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice's recommendations, but who still developed severe invasive pneumococcal disease with life-threatening complications caused by S. pneumoniae serotype 19A."

METHODS: Retrospective data on demographics, clinical presentation, outcomes and laboratory findings of 116 children admitted into Tuanku Jaafar Hospital in Seremban, Malaysia from 2012 to 2013 with documented diagnosis of community-acquired adenovirus ARI were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Male to female ratio was 1.70. Median age was 14 (1-107) months. The commonest symptoms were fever (94.8%; 110/116), cough (82.8%, 96), rhinorrhea (63.8%; 74), interrupted feeding (66.4%; 77), diarrhea (33.6%; 39) and conjunctivitis (21.6%; 25). Mean temperature on admission was 38.4 C+-0.9 C. Among all 116 subjects, 20.7% (24) needed oxygen supplementation, 57.8% (67) required intravenous hydration, 11.2% (13) were admitted into the pediatric intensive care unit and 6.9% (8) required mechanical ventilation. Only 1% (1/87) had positive blood culture (Streptococcus pneumoniae) among 87 who received antibiotic treatment. Case fatality rate was 2.6% (3/116) and 1.7% (2/116) developed bronchiolitis obliterans. Median length of hospital stay was 4 (1-50) days. CONCLUSION: Adenovirus ARI caused significant morbidity and substantial resource utilization among hospitalized Malaysian children. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants below two years presenting with ARI associated with high fever. Antibiotics should not be prescribed as secondary bacterial infections are uncommon."

In 2008, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in the childhood vaccination schedule and then replaced by 13-valent PCV in 2010. First dose is given at 2 months of age. Protection of neonates is expected with universal vaccination. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation, microbiology and outcome of neonates with pneumococcal invasive infections (PII) detected in two hospitals in Uruguay in 2001-2007 (pre-vaccination), 2008 (intervention) and 2009-2013 (post-vaccination). METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study was done at Pereira Rossell Hospital and Paysandu Hospital. All isolates of S. pneumoniae obtained from normally sterile fluids were included. Data were obtained from the clinical records and the microbiology laboratory. A statistical analysis with absolute frequencies, relative, rates and relative risk was performed. RESULTS: 25 neonates were enrolled with diagnosis of: sepsis (n = 13), meningitis (n = 9), bacteremia (n = 1), pneumonia with empyema (n = 1) and pneumonia (n = 1). The incidence of PII in the prevaccination period was 19/25, with a rate of 0.30/1,000 births, compared to post-vaccination rate of 0.04/1,000. The relative risk was 5.9. 6/20 (30%) cases of death were reported (meningitis n = 3; sepsis n = 2; empyema n = 1). Most common serotypes were 5 and 1 (14/25) and 24/25 strains were susceptible to penicillin. DISCUSSION: The symptoms were indistinguishable to infections caused by other pathogens. PII cases decreased and no deaths occurred in the post-vaccination period. No increase in non-vaccine serotypes was observed."

However, data regarding their clinical characteristics are limited. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical and radiologic features of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with or without parapneumonic effusion caused by VS. METHODS: Of 455 consecutive CAP patients with or without parapneumonic effusion, VS were isolated from the blood or pleural fluid in 27 (VS group, 5.9%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified as a single etiologic agent in 70 (control group) patients. We compared various clinical parameters between the VS group and the control group. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the VS group was characterized by more frequent complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema and bed-ridden status, lower incidences of productive cough, elevated procalcitonin (&gt;0.5 ng/mL), lower age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score, and more frequent ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation on computed tomography (CT) scans. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, productive cough, bed-ridden status, and GGO or consolidation on CT scans were independent predictors of community-acquired respiratory tract infection caused by VS. CONCLUSION: CAP caused by VS commonly presents as complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema. It is characterized by less frequent productive cough, more frequent bed-ridden status, and less common CT pulmonary parenchymal lesions. However, its treatment outcome and clinical course are similar to those of pneumococcal pneumonia."

S.pneumoniae and IPDs are situated in the focus of the vaccine studies because of being encompassed of a significant burden of disease in the world, severe mortality and morbidities, and location in vaccine-preventable diseases group. Although S.pneumoniae has more than 90 defined serotypes, certain serotypes are often identified as the cause of IPDs. Individuals with comorbid and chronic diseases, primary or secondary immune deficiencies, and &lt;2 years or &gt;65 years of age are at increased risk for IPDs. Currently, a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine and also 7, 10 and 13 valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCV) have been produced for pneumococci. Phase studies of protein based vaccines, which will provide protection independent of serotypes, and 15-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine are still ongoing. In Turkey, in November 2008 PCV7 and in April 2011 PCV13 have been implemented in the national immunization program. First case of the pneumococcal unvaccinated cases presented in this report was a 6-year-old girl patient with pneumonia and pleural empyema due to S.pneumoniae serotype 1, without any underlying risk factors. The other case is a 52-days-old male patient, who had a history of pneumococcal septicemia in the newborn period and was followed for bacteremia associated S.pneumoniae serotype 12B and diagnosed as complement deficiency on follow-up. S.pneumoniae serotype 1 is within serotypes covered by 10 and 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine that are in use today, and is a highly invasive strain often isolated in pneumococcal lobar pneumonia and empyema. S.pneumoniae serotype 12B is a non-vaccine serotype not included in any of conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines, and usually obtained in respiratory infections and nasopharyngeal carriage studies. The first case of this report was presented because of an IPD with a serotype included in PCV13 implemented in the routine childhood vaccination schedule and to give an idea about pneumococcal strains circulating in the community. The second case was discussed to draw attention for the evaluation of immune deficiencies and other risk factors in recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococci. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contribute the public immunity with the reduction of vaccine-type pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, IPD incidence, and IPD associated morbidity and mortality especially in young children, at the same time cause a decrease in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections. Application of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines covering the whole society is important, according to all these important results."

We retrospectively investigated a total of 66 hospitalized infants under the age of three years with chronic wet cough enrolled in the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Soochow University from October 2010 to March 2014. All patients underwent bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples were processed for microbiological and cytological analysis. Of 66 patients with wet cough, 50 (75.8%) were diagnosed with PBB. In the PBB group, wet cough was accompanied by wheezing (90%). Airway malacia were identified in 22 cases (44%). The clinical manifestations of PBB with airway malacia did not differ from those without malacia. Haemophilus influenzae (47.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (36.8%) were the most commonly identified pathogens. Furthermore, CD3(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) cells were significantly lower in the PBB group (p &lt; 0.01), while CD19(+), CD16(+)CD56(+) and CD23(+) cells were elevated (p &lt; 0.01) in the PBB group. Our study revealed PBB is an important cause of chronic wet cough in Chinese infants, and that changes of lymphocyte subsets are observed in children with PBB. Airway malacia frequently co-existed with PBB, but did not exacerbate the disease. "

The effects of SPn nasopharyngeal colonization on respiratory tract infections are poorly studied. We evaluated the association of SPn colonization with features of respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Children under the age of 6 years who visited a primary care physician because of respiratory tract infections were enrolled in the study. History was taken, children were clinically assessed by the physician, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and cultured for SPn. Positive samples were serotyped. Associations of SPn colonization with clinical signs and symptoms, recovery duration, absence from day care centre, frequencies of specific diagnoses, and treatment with antimicrobials were evaluated. RESULTS: In total 900 children were enrolled. The prevalence of SPn colonization was 40.8 % (n = 367). There were minor differences between male and female subjects (199 of 492, 40.4 % vs 168 of 408, 41.2 %, p = 0.825). Children with and without siblings had similar colonization rates (145 of 334, 43.4 % vs 219 of 562, 39.0 %, p = 0.187). Clinical signs and symptoms were not associated with SPn colonization. Children colonized with SPn had longer recovery duration compared to non-colonized children (114 of 367, 31.1 % vs 98 of 533, 18.4 %, p &lt; 0.001) and were longer absent from day care (270 of 608, 44.4 % vs 94 of 284, 33.1 %, p = 0.001). Pneumonia, sinusitis, and acute otitis media were more frequently diagnosed in children colonized with SPn. Children attending day care centres had significantly higher prevalence of SPn colonization (270 of 367, 44.4 % vs 338 of 533, 33.1 %, p = 0.001). Children with pneumonia, sinusitis and acute otitis media were more frequently treated with antimicrobials than children with other diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: SPn nasopharyngeal colonization has a negative impact on the course of respiratory tract infection, likely because of SPn being the cause of the disease or a complicating factor. It is also associated with and may be responsible for higher frequencies of bronchitis, pneumonia, acute otitis media, sinusitis and the need of antimicrobial treatment."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:26524622TITLE:Etiology and Outcome of Diffuse Acute Infectious Bronchiolitis in Adults.ABSTRACT:RATIONALE: The etiology and outcome of diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis (DAIB) in adults is not well known. OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively review adult patients with DAIB without pneumonia, document the etiologies and outcomes, and assess the relation between DAIB and postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 1,664 patients with lower respiratory tract infections admitted to our institution in Saitama, Japan. DAIB was diagnosed when patients developed acute feverish lower respiratory tract infection and chest computed tomography demonstrated mainly multiple centrilobular nodules in four or more lobes. Pneumonia was diagnosed when patients developed acute feverish lower respiratory tract infection and chest computed tomography demonstrated consolidation and/or ground-glass opacities with or without centrilobular nodules. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1,664 patients, 20 (1.2%) and 1,644 (98.8%) patients were diagnosed as having DAIB and pneumonia, respectively. Of the 20 patients with DAIB, the etiology was determined in 16 (80%): 13 (65.0%) had a single pathogen and 3 (15.0%) had two pathogens. Detected organisms included Mycoplasma pneumoniae in eight (40.0%) patients, influenza virus in two (10.0%), influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in two (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae in three (15.0%), and respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in one (5.0%) patient. All patients improved and none developed postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. CONCLUSIONS: The three most common etiologies of DAIB in the studied adults were M. pneumoniae, influenza virus, and H. influenzae. None of the patients with DAIB developed postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans."

We report the case of a Spanish female aged 22 and diagnosed of selective IgA deficiency, a long history of bronchitis, several episodes of pneumonia, bilateral bronchiectasis, normal IgG, IgM, IgG subclasses, and detectable pre-vaccination IgG antibodies against tetanus toxoid and Streptococcus pneumoniae. She was evaluated in our clinic in order to rule out common variable immunodeficiency. We observed good antibody response to tetanus toxoid, absence of circulating switched memory B cells, decreased response to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens and a lack of response to Salmonella typhi vaccine. Most SIgAD patients presents with upper respiratory tract infections or mild diarrhea. Those with lower tract infections, pneumonia or untreatable diarrhea should follow B-cell subpopulations' study and antibody response to vaccines. Absence of response to Salmonella typhi vaccine allowed us to expose the defective antibody production. "

Overall, 108 PF and 5811 Pn episodes were recorded. Children with PF were older. Prematurity (6.6% vs 14.0%) and asthma (9.9% vs 23.5%) were less common in PF. Mean temperature and saturation were higher in PF while hemoglobin and sodium levels were lower in PF compared with Pn. Nasal washes were obtained in 30.6% and 39.9% of PF and Pn episodes, respectively, with respiratory syncytial virus identified more commonly in Pn (24.2% vs 42.3%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 5.2% and 0.9% of blood cultures in PF and Pn, respectively. In conclusion, PF differed from Pn in demographic and clinical characteristics, possibly due to differences in etiology. Although both diseases are considered bacterial, a high proportion of viral etiology was found in both, especially in Pn."

METHOD: A retrospective analysis included 182 children in Children's Hospital of Fudan University, diagnosed with measles from January 1, 2012 to December 31. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, including the gender, age, the incidence of seasonal trends, measles vaccine vaccination history, contact history and other clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and so on were analyzed. And the reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was adopted to detect sputum specimens from suspected patients with measles,who were selected randomly,the sequence of the part of the PCR products was analyzed. RESULT: (1) Clinical and epidemiological data: Totally were 182 children with measles (125 males, 57 females) were enrolled into this study. The age of the patients ranged from 3 months to 89 months, 127 cases were younger than 9 months (69. 8%). The prevalence season was from April to August, while the peak month was April and May (22. 5%, 23. 1%). Among 182 hospitalized children, only 11 cases underwent measles vaccination (6. 0%), and among them 5 cases were within 2 weeks before disease onset. A total of 167 cases (91. 8%) had not been vaccinated, most of whom were immigrants, and the measles vaccination history of the remaining 4 cases were unknown. There was a positive correlation between the measles vaccination ratio in children of the floating population (8. 45%, 6/71) and the settled children (29.4%, 5/17, chi =8. 11 P =0. 004). In total, 24 cases (13. 2%) had definite measles exposure history, with 153 cases (84. 1%) of unknown origin,5 cases (2.7%) without any history of contact. (2) Clinical manifestations: All the 182 patients had fever (100%) and obvious rashes (100%), among them 145 cases had body temperature higher than 39  C (79. 7%). The fever period ranged from 2 to 38 days. Among 182 hospitalized children,165 cases (90. 7%) had typical measles,17 cases had atypical measles. Among the 17 cases, two had severe measles, one had heterotypic measles. (3) The common complica tions: 96 cases had pneumonia (52. 8%), 80 had laryngitis (44. 0%), 38 had bronchitis (20. 9%),15 had hepatic dysfunction (8. 2%), 11 had myocardial damage (6. 0%), 3 had febrile seizures (1. 6%), and no patient had encephalitis. Of the 96 cases with pneumonia, 92 received sputum test; 38 were sputum culture positive (41%). The dominant pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae(11/38,29%), Haemophilus influenzae (6/ 38,16%), Moraxella catarrhalis (4/38, 11%), Escherichia coli (4/38, 11%), Candida albicans (4/38, 11%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4/38, 11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (3/38, 8%). (4) The H1a genotype was the only one genotype in the detected sequence of 54 measles virus strains. CONCLUSION: Measles was more often seen in the children under the age of 9 months from the floating population. The morbidity peak month was from April to May in Shanghai. The H1a genotype was the only one genotype. We should try to improve vaccination coverage rate in the children who are at the age for vaccination, so as to prevent measles outbreak."

Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia frequently overlap those present with viral infections or reactive airway disease. Optimally, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia should be supported by a chest radiograph before starting antimicrobials. Factors such as age, vital signs and other measures of illness severity are critical when deciding whether to admit a patient to hospital. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children, prescribing amoxicillin or ampicillin for seven to 10 days remains the mainstay of empirical therapy for nonsevere pneumonia. If improvement does not occur, consideration should be given to searching for complications (empyema or lung abscess). Routine chest radiographs at the end of therapy are not recommended unless clinically indicated. "

METHOD: The clinical data of patients seen from October, 2010 to March, 2014 in Department of Respiratory Diseases of our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were over 4 weeks cough, receiving fiberoptic bronchoscopy, positive bacterial culture and (or) the increased percentage of neutral granulocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). RESULT: Twenty eight patients were involved, 26 were male (93%) and two were female (7%). The median age of patients was 8.5 months. The median duration of cough was four weeks. The average length of hospital stay was (8.3 +- 3.9)days. The main clinical feature was wet cough in 28 cases, wet cough with wheezing was seen in 21 cases. The wet cough phase distribution was irregular in 21 cases. The crackles with wheeze (in 21 cases) was main signs of PBB. The percentage of CD3- CD16+ 56+ cells increased in peripheral blood. The fiberoptic bronchoscopic manifestations of PBB were luminal mucosal edema. Eleven patients also had airway malacia. The neutrophil median in BALF was 0.2. The positive rate of bacterial culture of BALF was 36%. The main bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (50%) and Haemophilus influenzae (30%). The main treatment for PBB patients included amoxycillin/clavulanate potassium and second-generation cephalosporins. The average duration of treatment was (17.3 +- 3.2)days, the prognosis was good. CONCLUSION: PBB is common in male infants. Persistent wet cough with wheezing was the main characteristic of PBB. PBB is commonly accompanied by immune dysfunction and airway malacia, and the pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae."

There is no report concerning lung abscess in Korean children. We aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of pediatric lung abscess and compare the difference between primary and secondary abscess groups. METHODS: The medical records of 11 lung abscess patients (7 males and 4 females) from March 1998 to August 2011 at two university hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics, symptoms, underlying disease, laboratory and radiologic findings, microbiological results, and treatments were examined. RESULTS: Six patients had underlying structural-related problems (e.g., skeletal anomalies). No immunologic or hematologic problem was recorded. The mean ages of the primary and secondary groups were 2.4 and 5.3 years, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. The mean length of hospital stay was similar in both groups (22.8 days vs. 21.4 days). Immunologic studies were performed in 3 patients; the results were within the normal range. Most patients had prominent leukocytosis. Seven and 4 patients had right and left lung abscess, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and antimycoplasma antibodies were detected in both groups. Two patients with primary lung abscess were administered antibiotics in the absence of other procedures, while 8 underwent interventional procedures, including 5 with secondary abscess. CONCLUSION: The most common symptoms were fever and cough. All patients in the primary group were younger than 3 years. Structural problems were dominant.

We studied the impact of the serotype shift on clinical syndromes and outcomes. METHODS: Pneumococcal isolates from hospitalized IPD patients obtained from nine sentinel microbiology laboratories, covering 25% of the Dutch population, were serotyped. Clinical syndromes, outcomes and patient characteristics in the post-PCV7 (2008-2012) period were compared with the pre-PCV7 period (2004-2006). Serotype specific propensity of the association with empyema, meningitis and death was calculated. RESULTS: Invasive pneumonia incidence significantly decreased in children &lt;5 years and elderly &gt;=65 years, but increased in 5-64 years old from 4.92 to 5.58 cases/100.000/year (RR 1.13 95% CI 0.99-1.29). Empyema incidence significantly increased in elderly 65 years and older from 0.61 to 2.60 cases/100.000/year (RR 4.28 95% CI 1.97-9.33), mainly due to serotype 1. The incidence of meningitis only declined significantly in children &lt;5 years. IPD case-fatality decreased in children &lt;5 years from 5% to 3%, in 5-64 years old from 9% to 7% and in elderly &gt;=65 years significantly from 22% to 17%, due to lower case-fatality rates for most emerging non-PCV7 serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in empyema incidence was observed in persons &gt;=65 years old in the post-PCV7 era, mainly due to the emergence of serotype 1, although overall IPD case-fatality decreased. Extended conjugate vaccines that target serotype 1 or serotypes with high case-fatality may offer further reduction of pneumococcal disease burden."

STUDY DESIGN: In the region of Madrid, universal immunization with the PCV13 started in May 2010. In July 2012, public funding ceased. Vaccination coverage decreased from &gt;95% to 82% in 2013 and to 67% in 2014. We performed a multicenter surveillance and case-control study from 2009-2014. Cases were hospitalized children with bacteremic CAP. Controls were children selected 1:1 from next-admitted with negative blood cultures and typical, presumed bacterial CAP. RESULTS: Annual incidence of bacteremic CAP declined from 7.9/100,000 children (95% CI 5.1-11.1) in 2009 to 2.1/100,000 children (95% CI 1.1-4.1) in 2012. In 2014, 2 years after PCV13 was withdrawn from the universal vaccination program, the incidence of bacteremic CAP increased to 5.4/100,000 children (95% CI 3.5-8.4). We enrolled 113 cases and 113 controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae caused most of bloodstream infections (78%). Empyema was associated with bacteremia (P = .003, OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.4-8.9). Simple parapneumonic effusion was not associated with bacteremia. Incomplete PCV immunization was not a risk factor for bacteremic pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: High rate of PCV13 immunization was associated with decreased incidence of bacteremic CAP; this incidence increased when rate of immunization fell.

However the rate of occult bacteremia in infants with RSV infection is not well established. The aim was to determine the actual rate and predictive factors of bacteremia in children admitted to hospital due to confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI), using both conventional culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011-2013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. RESULTS: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2). In those patients with bacteremia, there was a previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection and had received empirical antibiotic treatment 6 out of 7 (85.7%) patients. There were significant differences in terms of severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015); respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value &lt; 0.001); Wood-Downes score (mean = 8.7 vs. 4.8 points, P-value &lt; 0.001); GENVIP scale (mean = 17 vs. 10.1, P-value &lt; 0.001); and length of hospitalization (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence, etiology, clinical features, treatment strategies and outcomes of PPE/PE in children treated in a referral pulmonary center in central Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological and laboratory data of all children aged between 1 month and 18 years with PPE/PE due to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) between January 2002 and December 2013. RESULTS: One thousand nine hundred and thirty three children with CAP were hospitalized between 2002 and 2013. Parapneumonic effusion or PE was diagnosed in 323 children (16.7%). The proportion of children with CAP related PPE/PE increased from 5.4% in 2002 to 18.8% in 2013.

Few data describing GAS pleural empyema in children are available. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and microbiological features, management and outcome of GAS pleural empyema in children and compare them with those of pneumococcal empyema. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Fifty children admitted for GAS pleural empyema between January 2006 and May 2013 to 8 hospitals participating in a national pneumonia survey were included in a descriptive study and matched by age and centre with 50 children with pneumococcal empyema. RESULTS: The median age of the children with GAS pleural empyema was 2 (range 0.1-7.6) years. Eighteen children (36%) had at least one risk factor for invasive GAS infection (corticosteroid use and/or current varicella). On admission, 37 patients (74%) had signs of circulatory failure, and 31 (62%) had a rash. GAS was isolated from 49/50 pleural fluid samples and from one blood culture. The commonest GAS genotype was emm1 (n=17/22). Two children died (4%). Children with GAS empyema presented more frequently with a rash (p&lt;0.01), signs of circulatory failure (p=0.01) and respiratory disorders (p=0.02) and with low leucocyte levels (p=0.04) than children with pneumococcal empyema.

As only few data on etiology of PPE/PE in Central Europe have been reported, we undertook a study on the etiology of PPE/PE in children, using both standard culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between June 2011 and December 2013. Consecutive children with PPE/PE complicating community acquired pneumonia, who required diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis were included. Blood and pleural fluid samples for microbiological cultures were collected. Molecular methods were applied to identify Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses in pleural fluid. RESULTS: The study group included 64 children, median age 4 (1-15). Seven of 64 (10.9%) blood cultures and 11 of 64 (17.2%) pleural fluid cultures revealed bacterial growth. The most common bacteria detected was S. pneumoniae (13 blood and pleural fluid samples from 11/64 (17.2%) children). DNA sequences of typical bacteria were found in 29/64 (45.3%) pleural fluid samples. S. pneumoniae was identified in 90% of these samples. The most common serotypes were: serotype 6B in 9/26 (36.6%), 19A in 6/26 (23%), serotype 3 in 3/26 (11.5%), 6A and 23F (both in 2/26 i.e. 7.7%) patients. Molecular methods identified atypical bacteria in 8/58 (13.8%) and respiratory viruses in 12/58 (20.7%) pleural fluid samples. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, in particular serotype 6B and 19A, is the most common etiologic agent of PPE/PE in Polish children.

Since July 2010, PCV13 has been the most commonly used PCV. In a study conducted at the University General Hospital of Larissa, Central Greece, from January 2012 to January 2016, 85.7% of children born after the implementation of PCV13 and aged 24-59 months had received the complete series (3 + 1 immunization schedule) of PCV13. METHODS: We studied all paediatric community-acquired pneumonia cases with empyema hospitalized at the University General Hospital of Larissa from January 2008 to January 2016. RESULTS: There were 30 cases of parapneumonic empyema. Among 27 empyema cases of known aetiology, 19 (70.4%) were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (identifiable serotypes 3, 19A, 7F, and 9N/L). After September 2011, no more cases caused by serotypes 7F and 19A were observed, whereas serotype 3 emerged as the predominant pathogen of pneumococcal empyema (9 of 11 cases). Serotype 3 continued to cause empyema despite vaccination with PCV13 either fully with a 3 + 1 schedule (n = 3) or with one booster dose at the age of 21 months (n = 1). CONCLUSION: In Central Greece during the first five years of high coverage with PCV13, serotype 3 was the only PCV13 serotype that clearly persisted in children with empyema."

Questions addressed: Are different types of PCACP one disease? How do different treatment protocols affect the outcome? METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of PCACP hospitalizations in the three major hospitals in Jerusalem in the years 2001-2010 for demographics, clinical presentation, management, and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 144 children (51% aged 1-4 years), 91% of Jewish origin; 40% had para-pneumonic effusion (PPE), 40% empyema (EMP), and 20% necrotizing pneumonia (NP). Bacterial origin was identified in 42% (empyema 79%, P = 0.009), most common S. pneumoniae (32%), group A streptococcus (9%). Patients with EMP, compared to PPE and NP, were less likely to receive prior antibiotic treatment (35% vs. 57% and 59%, respectively, P = 0.04). Mean hospitalization was longer in patients with NP followed by EMP and PPE (16.4 +- 10.6, 15.2 +- 7.9, and 12.7 +- 4.7 days, respectively), use of fibrinolysis was not associated with the outcome. All children had recovered to discharge regardless of antibiotic therapy or fibrinolysis. ANSWER: NP is a more severe disease with prolonged morbidity and hospitalization in spite of prior antibiotic treatment. All types had favorable outcome regardless of treatment-protocol.

METHOD: A retrospective review of 31 patients with PBB from Octorber 2010 to May 2014 in Department 2 of Respiratory Diseases in Beijing Children's Hospital was undertaken. RESULT: (1) The patients (17 boys and 14 girls) were 6 months to 3 years old. The main complaint was chronic wet cough (&gt;4 weeks); 13 cases had fever and 25 cases had wheezing. Rattle was heard on auscultation in all patients. (2) Chest X ray showed an increase in bronchovascular markings in all cases, accompanied by patchy infiltration in 6 cases. The high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrated bronchial wall thickening in 25 cases, associated with peri-bronchial patchy infiltration in 18 cases, with organized pneumonia in 7 cases ( atelectasis in 5 cases). Centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacity were observed in the remaining 6 patients. (3) Purulent secretion was seen in endobronchial cavity by bronchoscopy. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from sputum culture or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture in 16 patients. (4)Patients recovered completely after over 2 weeks'treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate or the second and third generation cephalosporin (including enzyme inhibitors) in 28 cases, carbapenems, teicoplanin , linezolid in 1 case respectively. CONCLUSION: PBB often occurred in 3 years old or younger patients and had chronic wet cough for more than 4 weeks, fever and wheezing. HRCT may reveal bronchial wall thickening, respiratory secretions culture may reveal Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Specifically, bacterial pericarditis, although now very rare, is often fatal because of its fulminant process. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 61-year-old man with metastatic small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy who presented with fatigue, poor appetite, and altered mental status. He was found to have a large-volume pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. He underwent emergent pericardiocentesis. The pericardial effusion was nonmalignant, with cultures growing Streptococcus pneumoniae. It was only after his emergent pericardiocentesis that previous imaging from one month prior was able to be reviewed, which showed possible right upper lobe abscess. CONCLUSIONS Most pericardial effusions in cancer patients are related to their malignancy, either due to direct metastasis or secondary physiologic effects. This case is a unique example of a lung cancer patient presenting with a pneumococcal pericardial effusion, which in itself is a rare phenomenon. This case report demonstrates the importance of considering early antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with pericardial effusion, especially given the high mortality rates of infectious pericardial effusions.

The aim of this study was to assess the burden of pneumonia in a large general population. METHODS: All pneumonia-related hospitalizations from 2004 to 2013 in north-east Italy were identified from the hospital records with a first-listed diagnosis on discharge of bacterial pneumonia, or a first-listed diagnosis on discharge of meningitis, septicemia or empyema associated with a secondary diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. We identified major comorbidities, calculated agespecific case-fatality rates (CFR), and estimated the related cost to the health care system. RESULTS: Of the 125,722 hospitalizations identified, 96.9% were cases of pneumonia, 2.4% of septicemia, 0.4% of meningitis, and 0.3% of empyema; 75.3% of hospitalizations involved &gt;= 65-yearolds. The overall CFR was 12.4%, and it increased with age, peaking in people over 80 (19.6%). The mean annual pneumonia-associated hospitalization rate was 204.6 per 100,000 population, and it peaked in 0- to 4-year-old children (325.6 per 100,000 in males, 288.9 per 100,000 in females), and adults over 65 (844.9 per 100,000 in males, 605.7 per 100,000 in females). Hospitalization rates dropped over the years for the 0-4 year-olds, and rose for people over 80. The estimated overall annual cost of these pneumonia-related hospitalizations was approximately $ 41 million. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the burden on resources for pneumonia-related hospitalization is an important public health issue. Prevention remains the most valuable tool for containing pneumonia, and vaccination strategies can help in the primary prevention of infection, possibly reducing the number of cases in all age groups."

METHODS: All pneumococcal pneumonias, empyemas or primary bacteraemias treated at two hospitals in Majorca from 2010 to 2015 were included. Clinical variables, serotypes, and antibiotic susceptibility were collected. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-nine pneumonias, 11 primary bacteraemias, and 2 empyemas in 243 patients were studied; 181 (69.1%) men, median age 76 years (range: 66-99). Seven (2.6%) were pneumococcal-vaccinated. Bacteraemia was present in 127 (61.9%) cases and related to a higher severity, p= 0.02, and not having chronic lung disease, p = 0.002. Ninety-seven (37%) episodes involved complications and 30 (11.5%) patients died. Mortality was related with the presence of complications at admission, p &lt; 0.001. Only septic shock was more frequent in patients &gt;=65 years during the period 2010-2015 compared to the period 2006-2010: 38 of 262 (14.5%) vs. 17 of 212 (8%), p = 0.02. Most infections (57.6%) were due to PCV-13 serotypes but were not related to a worse prognosis. The proportion of PCV-13 serotypes tended to decrease from 61% (non-invasive) and 80% (invasive) in 2010-2011 to 33% and 47% in 2014-2015. The antibiotic susceptibility remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of pneumococcal vaccination in elderly patients with pneumococcal infections were very low. Except for septic shock, the main outcome variables (including mortality) were similar to the ones observed in the period preceding PCV-13 authorization. PCV-13 serotypes were responsible for most infections although they showed a decreasing trend."

We compared the serotype distribution, antibiotic susceptibility, and outcomes of children with PP 4 years before and 4 years after the introduction of PCV13. Methods.: We identified patients &lt;=18 years with PP at 8 children's hospitals in the United States (2006-2014). Pneumococcal isolates were collected prospectively. Serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility were performed in a central laboratory. Clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively. Annual pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalization rates per 100 000 admissions with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Dichotomous variables were analyzed by chi2 test and continuous variables with Mann-Whitney U test. Results.: A total of 377 patients with PP requiring hospitalization were identified. Hospitalization rates of PP decreased from 53.6 to 23.3 per 100000 admissions post PCV13 (P &lt; .0001). Complicated PP rates also decreased (P &lt; .0001). Need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and invasive procedure remained unchanged after the introduction of PCV13. Comorbidities were more common among children with uncomplicated than complicated pneumonia (52.2% vs. 22.5%, P &lt; .001). Overall, PCV13 serotypes 19A, 3, 7F, and 1 caused 80% of PP. Hospitalization rates of PCV13 serotype pneumonia decreased from 47.2 to 15.7 per 100000 admissions post PCV13. In 2014, the most common serotypes were 3, 19A and 35B. Conclusions.: PP requiring hospitalization significantly decreased in children after PCV13 introduction. Complicated PP rates decreased steadily in 2011-2014. PCV13 serotypes 19A and 3 were still responsible for half of the cases of PP in 2011-2014."

Fully immunized cases with pneumoccal vaccine may sometimes develop a complicated pneumonia with empyema caused by a vaccine serotype. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old male patient was admitted with the complaints of fever. On the basis of findings and laboratory results, the patient was diagnosed as having empyema. He was successfully treated with parenteral antibiotics and chest tube drainage. The pleural fluid culture and hemoculture of the patient yielded penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and the isolate was identified as serotype 9V. The patient had been vaccinated with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine according to the Turkish national immunization schedule at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. His medical history and basic immunological profile were inconsistent with a primary immunodeficiency. CONCLUSION: The failure of the PCV13 vaccine may results in a complicated pneumonia with empyema. It is important to investigate serotypes of pneumococci in these cases to determine other possible vaccine failures due to PCV13 and to study the underlying mechanisms."

The prevalence of atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis among patients with these illnesses in the ambulatory setting has not been previously summarized. We set out to derive prevalence information from the existing literature. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE for prospective, consecutive-series studies reporting the prevalence of M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, L pneumophila and/or B pertussis in outpatients with cough, acute bronchitis, LRTI, or CAP. Articles were independently reviewed by 2 authors for inclusion and abstraction of data; discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion. A meta-analysis was performed on each pathogen to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates using a random effects model of raw proportions. RESULTS: Fifty studies met our inclusion criteria. While calculated heterogeneity was high, most studies reported prevalence for each pathogen within a fairly narrow range. In patients with CAP, the overall prevalences of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were 10.1% (95% CI, 7.1%-13.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%), respectively. Consistent with previous reports, M pneumoniae prevalence peaked in roughly 6-year intervals. Overall prevalence of L pneumophila was 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%), but the organism was rare in children, with only 1 case in 1,765. In patients with prolonged cough in primary care, the prevalence of B pertussis was 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-19.8%), although it was higher in studies that included only children (17.6%; 95% CI, 3.4%-31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical bacterial pathogens are relatively common causes of lower respiratory diseases, including cough, bronchitis, and CAP. Where surveillance data were available, we found higher prevalences in studies where all patients are tested for these pathogens. It is likely that these conditions are underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in current clinical practice."

Imaging methods and serology establish the diagnosis in most cases. Chest x-ray can diagnose uncomplicated pulmonary hydatid cysts, whereas superinfection and/or rupture of the hydatid cyst (complicated cysts) may change the radiographic appearance and lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a patient with hemoptysis and chest pain, where computer tomography scan of the lung suggested a large, ruptured hydatid cyst. However, serological tests with indirect hemagglutination (IHA)for Echinococcus granulosus antibodies were negative, and there was massive growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae in sputum. Based on this, we concluded that the patient had a bacterial lung abscess. The diagnosis of CE was only made after surgical removal of the cyst followed by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction."

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen causing parapneumonic effusions. In Morocco, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13-valent (PCV13) was introduced in the national immunization program in October 2010 in 2 + 1 schedule for prevention of pneumococcal disease, and replaced by the PCV10 in July 2012 in the same schedule. We report a case of parapneumonic pleural effusions caused by S. pneumoniae serotype 19A in a child immunized with 3 doses of PCV13. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a 2.5 years old previously healthy Moroccan female, fully vaccinated by PCV13 and immunocompetent, admitted to a private medical clinic with a six months history of persistent asthma. On arrival (7 February 2015), she was febrile to 40.3  C with a brutal flu syndrome, chills, dry cough and serous rhinitis, for which she received symptomatic treatment. A biological assessment was done that confirmed the clinical diagnosis of flu. Seven days after, she presented a progressive deterioration of its general condition and the onset of severe abdominal pain. She was hospitalized and a second biological assessment, computed tomography scans and chest radiography were done that confirmed a diagnosis of a pneumococcal parapneumonia with abscess of the left lower lobe with encysted empyema. Microbiological analysis of the pleural fluid showed a S. pneumoniae serotype 19A with susceptibility intermediate to penicillin. The patient was treated by antibiotics including amoxicillin, cefixime ceftriaxone and vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a case of parapneumonic pleural effusions caused by a vaccine serotype pneumococcal 19A occurring in an immunocompetent child immunized with 3 doses of PCV13."

However, the true value of the clinical and laboratory predictors of pediatric CAP still needs to be assessed. This prospective cohort study in three emergency departments enrolled 142 children with radiological pneumonia. Pneumonia with lung consolidation was the primary endpoint; complicated pneumonia (bacteremia, empyema, or pleural effusion) was the secondary endpoint. We showed that three clinical signs (unilateral hypoventilation, grunting, and absence of wheezing), elevated procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), negative nasopharyngeal viral PCR, or positive blood pneumococcal PCR (P-PCR) were significantly associated with both pneumonia with consolidation and complicated pneumonia. Children with negative clinical signs and low CRP values had a low probability of having pneumonia with consolidation (13%) or complicated pneumonia (6%). Associating the three clinical signs, CRP &gt;80 mg/L and a positive P-PCR ruled in the diagnosis of complicated pneumonia with a positive predictive value of 75%. CONCLUSION: A model incorporating clinical signs and laboratory markers can effectively assess the risk of having pneumonia. Children with negative clinical signs and low CRP are at a low risk of having pneumonia. For children with positive clinical signs and high CRP, a positive blood pneumococcal PCR can more accurately confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. What is Known:   Distinguishing between bacterial and viral pneumonia in children is challenging.   Reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics is a priority. What is New:   Children with negative clinical signs and low C-reactive protein (CRP) values have a low probability of having pneumonia.   Children with high CRP values can be tested using a pneumococcal PCR to rule in the diagnosis of pneumonia with a high positive predictive value."

The current trend in Streptococcus pneumoniae infections has been the rise of multi-drug resistance in the last two decades. We present the case of a pair of 16-month old African-American fraternal twins who presented to the emergency room on the same day for symptoms consistent with pneumonia. Upon further examination, the twins showed remarkably similar symptoms, and cultures revealed penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in both twins. The pneumonia affected both twins in the same way, but a tomography scan did not reveal any shared anatomical abnormalities to account for this near-identical progression. In a review of literature and case reports, there are no reported cases of fraternal twins with simultaneous or non-simultaneous pneumococcal pneumonia or effusions. This case suggests that there may be possible anatomical abnormalities in the fraternal twins which were not evident in routine testing that may have led to near-identical illnesses. The pathophysiology of the simultaneous and near identical infections is not clear but may reflect subtle genetic factors in the siblings."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:28770121TITLE:Necrotizing pneumonia: an emerging problem in children?ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: In children, necrotizing pneumonia (NP) is an uncommon, severe complication of pneumonia. It is characterized by destruction of the underlying lung parenchyma resulting in multiple small, thin-walled cavities and is often accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae. REVIEW: NP in children was first reported in children in 1994, and since then there has been a gradual increase in cases, which is partially explained by greater physician awareness and use of contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, and by temporal changes in circulating respiratory pathogens and antibiotic prescribing. The most common pathogens detected in children with NP are pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood, but likely relate to multiple host susceptibility and bacterial virulence factors, with viral-bacterial interactions also possibly having a role. Most cases are in previously healthy young children who, despite adequate antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia, remain febrile and unwell. Many also have evidence of pleural effusion, empyema, or pyopneumothorax, which has undergone drainage or surgical intervention without clinical improvement. The diagnosis is generally made by chest imaging, with CT scans being the most sensitive, showing loss of normal pulmonary architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and multiple thin-walled cavities. Blood culture and culture and molecular testing of pleural fluid provide a microbiologic diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases. Prolonged antibiotics, draining pleural fluid and gas that causes mass effects, and maintaining ventilation, circulation, nutrition, fluid, and electrolyte balance are critical components of therapy. Despite its serious nature, death is uncommon, with good clinical, radiographic and functional recovery achieved in the 5-6 months following diagnosis. Increased knowledge of NP's pathogenesis will assist more rapid diagnosis and improve treatment and, ultimately, prevention. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider that our understanding of NP is limited to individual case reports or small case series, and treatment data from randomized-controlled trials are lacking. Furthermore, case series are retrospective and usually confined to single centers. Consequently, these studies may not be representative of patients in other locations, especially when allowing for temporal changes in pathogen behaviour and differences in immunization schedules and antibiotic prescribing practices."

METHODS: We examined 458 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from 22 pediatric institutions throughout Japan from January to June 2010 (immediately after the introduction of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV-7]), and 370 strains obtained from 19 institutions from January to June 2012 (after PCV-7 became widely used). The samples were collected from children aged 0-14 years with conditions such as respiratory tract infections (upper airway inflammation, bronchitis, and pneumonia), meningitis, and sepsis. RESULTS: The most frequent serotype in the 2010 strains was 19F (17.3%), followed by 6B (16.8%), and 23F (15.1%). The most frequent serotype in the 2012 strains was 6C (10.0%), followed by 19F (9.7%), 15A (8.9%) and 15B (8.9%), indicating a significant change in the distribution. The serotypes contained in PCV-7 were detected in 280 strains (61.1%) in 2010 and in 81 strains (21.9%) in 2012 (P &lt; 0.01). The serotypes contained in PCV-13 were detected in 356 strains (77.7%) in 2010 and in 146 strains (39.5%) in 2012 (P &lt; 0.01). A total of 129 subjects who had not been vaccinated with PCV-7 and 127 subjects who had been vaccinated with PCV-7 at least once, were compared with regard to the 2012 strains. The serotypes contained in PCV-7 were found in 21 strains (16.5%) in those who had been vaccinated and in 37 strains (28.7%) in those who had not been vaccinated (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The increased use of PCV-7 led to decreases in the serotypes contained in PCV-13 and increases in the serotypes not contained in PCV-13, suggesting serotype replacement."

Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TA) is present on erythrocytes, platelets and glomeruli, and it can be activated during pneumococcal infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of TA activation for pneumococcal infection and association with the severity of complicated pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with lobar pneumonia were routinely tested for TA at the Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital from January 2010 to December 2015. We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed their charts and data including age, sex, etiology of infection, chest tube insertion or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, length of hospital stay, TA activation, white blood cell count and level of C reactive protein. RESULTS: A total of 142 children with lobar pneumonia were enrolled, including 35 with empyema, 31 with effusion, 11 with necrotizing pneumonia and four with lung abscess. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly identified pathogen. Twenty-two patients (15.4%) had activated TA, all of whom were infected with S. pneumoniae. TA activation had 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value for pneumococcal infection. In the multivariate analysis in lobar pneumonia, TA activation (OR, 15.8; 95% CI, 3.0-83.5; p = 0.001), duration of fever before admission (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; p = 0.013) and initial CRP level (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1; p = 0.004) were independent predictors of empyema. CONCLUSIONS: TA activation is a specific marker for pneumococcal pneumonia and might indicate higher risk for complicated pneumonia."

However, its role in chronic endobronchial infections and accompanying lower airway neutrophilic infiltration has received little attention. Severe and recurrent pneumonia are risk factors for chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis; the latter causes considerable morbidity and, in some populations, premature death in children and adults. Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is another chronic endobronchial infection associated with substantial morbidity. In some children, PBB may progress to bronchiectasis. Although nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is the main pathogen in PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis, pneumococci are isolated commonly from the lower airways of children with these diagnoses. Here we review what is known currently about pneumococci in PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis, including the importance of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization and how persistence in the lower airways may contribute to the pathogenesis of these chronic pulmonary disorders. Antibiotic treatments, particularly long-term azithromycin therapy, are discussed together with antibiotic resistance and the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Important areas requiring further investigation are identified, including immune responses associated with pneumococcal lower airway infection, alone and in combination with other respiratory pathogens, and microarray serotyping to improve detection of carriage and infection by multiple serotypes. Genome wide association studies of pneumococci from the upper and lower airways will help identify virulence and resistance determinants, including potential therapeutic targets and vaccine antigens to treat and prevent endobronchial infections. Much work is needed, but the benefits will be substantial."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:28981235TITLE:[Lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent adult].ABSTRACT:Lower respiratory tract infections represent one of the main causes of mortality in the world. They essentially consist of bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary diseases (COPD) and acute pneumonia. If acute bronchitis is mainly of viral origin, acute exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia are mainly due to a trio of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Other pathogens as many viruses and atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella, some Enterobacteriaceae and very rarely Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also implicated. S. pneumoniae is the pathogen associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality and empirical antibiotic treatment should always be active on this germ. According to the type of infection and factors of comorbidity, empirical antibiotic treatment should cover a number of other pathogens. Beta-lactams, associated or not with macrolides/azalides are the first line treatment. Fluoroquinolones, although highly active against all pathogens, must be used only in restricted situations in order to avoid emergence of resistance to these antibiotics."

The objective of this study was to ascertain the clinical utility of a Streptococcus pneumoniae real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay compared with standard blood culture for the diagnosis of pneumococcal bacteremia in children in the post-vaccine era. METHODS: A systematic retrospective review of laboratory and patient records from Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, during a 6-year period was performed. Paired blood PCR and blood culture specimens from children younger than 16 years of age were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed to measure the diagnostic accuracy of PCR versus routine bacterial culture techniques. RESULTS: More than 1900 PCR test requests were examined from 2010 to 2015, of which 1561 paired PCR and blood culture specimens met criteria for inclusion in the statistical analysis. The PCR assay demonstrated high specificity (99%, confidence interval 95%: 98.81%-99.69%); however, the sensitivity was low compared with that of blood culture (47%, confidence interval 95%: 21.27%-73.41%). Investigation of 10 PCR-positive/culture-negative cases revealed that these cases ranged from definite, probable, and possible significance, indicating a low false positivity rate associated with the assay. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the limited utility of blood PCR testing for S. pneumoniae in pediatric patients without radiographic evidence pneumonia or empyema. Moreover, we report that PCR may be a useful diagnostic tool when blood cultures are negative because of antimicrobial therapy before sampling. Given that the incidence of pneumococcal disease has decreased considerably in recent years, justification of S. pneumoniae PCR requisition is necessary. Hence, new guidelines for pediatric pneumococcal blood PCR testing have been introduced at the Irish Meningitis and Sepsis Reference Laboratory."

The aims of this study were to describe and compare demographic characteristics, clinical, laboratory, microbiological findings and treatment modalities of patients with PPE and empyema. We retrospectively reviewed 116 pediatric patients with PPE and empyema. Seventy (60.3%) had pleural empyema and 46 patients (39.6%) had PPE. The median age of patients with empyema [72.0 months (IQR 68.0 months)] was lower than the patients with PPE [92.5 (IQR 80.0 months)] (p=0.003). Children in the empyema group had significantly more dyspnea symptoms than the children with PPE (p=0.022). Mean fever duration before hospitalization was similar in both groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A streptococcus were the most common causes of empyema. All of the patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics. In addition to medical treatment, tube thoracostomy was performed in 59 of 70 (84.3%) patients in empyema group; 27 (45.8%) of them required intrapleural fibrinolysis also. In the presence of antibiotic treatment failure or in cases with moderate or large pleural effusion with loculations and clinical deterioration; it is necessary to perform drainage of the purulent fluid by tube thoracostomy, to add intrapleural fibrinolytics or to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), in order to enhance prompt recovery."

Between September 2013 and December 2014, samples from 372 children aged between 1 month and 5 years were collected, and tested using multiplex real-time RT-PCR by a commercial assay for 21 respiratory pathogens. In addition, samples were screened for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae 16S rDNA using real-time PCR. The viral distribution and its association with clinical symptoms were statistically analyzed. Viral pathogens were detected in 342 (91.93%) of the samples of which 28.76% were single positive and 63.17% had multiple infections. The most frequent detected viruses were rhinovirus (55.64%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (33.06%), adenovirus (25.00%), coronavirus NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E (21.50%), and metapneumovirus A/B (16.12%). Children in the youngest age group (1-3 months) exhibited the highest frequencies of infection. Related to their frequency of detection, RSV A/B was the most associated pathogen with patient's demographic situation and clinical manifestations (p&lt;0.05). Parainfluenza virus 1-4 and parechovirus were found to increase the risk of death (p&lt;0.05). Adenovirus was statistically associated to the manifestation of gastroenteritis (p = 0.004). Rhinovirus infection increases the duration of oxygen support (p = 0.042). Coronavirus group was statistically associated with the manifestation of bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and laryngitis (p = 0.017). Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA was detected in 143 (38.44%) of tested samples. However, only 53 samples had a concentration of C-reactive protein from equal to higher than 20 milligrams per liter, and 6 of them were single positive for Streptocuccus pneumoniae. This study confirms the high incidence of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections in the Sousse area, Tunisia."

A 64-year-old female with a medical history of psoriatic arthritis and diabetes was transferred from an outside hospital for ventilator dependent respiratory failure and altered mental status. She initially presented with worsening back pain and was found to have leukocytosis with bandemia and acute renal failure but she was in septic shock upon arrival to our tertiary care center. Her blood cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae and MRI of the brain revealed pus within the posterior lateral ventricles and multiple infarcts. MRI of the spine revealed a psoas abscess. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mitral valve vegetation and her right eye developed endogenous endophthalmitis. She was treated with intravenous and intravitreal antibiotics and underwent drainage of the abscess with no improvement in mental status. Repeat imaging revealed multiple new thalamic, basal ganglia, and parietal lobe infarcts likely from septic emboli. After a protracted ICU stay, the patient's family opted for comfort care. The incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections has declined rapidly since the advent of antibiotics and vaccines. With the growing incidence of antibiotic resistance as well as the emergence of new immunomodulating drugs for various pathologies, there is a concern that invasive infections will reemerge. Ventriculitis and endogenous endophthalmitis are very rare complications of pneumococcal bacteremia."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:29415741TITLE:Elucidating the impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine programme on pneumonia, sepsis and otitis media hospital admissions in England using a composite control.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in England in September 2006, changing to the 13-valent vaccine in April 2010. PCV impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been extensively reported, but less described is its impact on the burden of pneumonia, sepsis and otitis media in the hospital. METHODS: Using details on all admissions to hospitals in England, we compared the incidence of pneumococcal-specific and syndromic disease endpoints in a 24-month pre-PCV period beginning April 2004 to the 24-month period ending March 2015 to derive incidence rate ratios (IRRs). To adjust for possible secular trends in admission practice, IRRs were compared to the IRRs for five control conditions over the same period and the relative change assessed using the geometric mean of the five control IRRs as a composite, and individually for each control condition to give the min-max range. Relative changes were also compared with IRRs for IPD from the national laboratory database. The effect of stratifying cases into those with and without clinical risk factors for pneumococcal infection was explored. RESULTS: Relative reductions in pneumococcal pneumonia were seen in all age groups and in those with and without risk factors; in children under 15 years old reductions were similar in magnitude to reductions in IPD. For pneumonia of unspecified cause, relative reductions were seen in those under 15 years old (maximum reduction in children under 2 years of 34%, min-max: 11-49%) with a relative increase in 65+ year olds most marked in those with underlying risk conditions (41%, min-max: 0-82%). Reductions in pneumococcal sepsis were seen in all age groups, with the largest reduction in children younger than 2 years (67%, min-max 56-75%). Reductions in empyema and lung abscess were also seen in under 15 year olds. Results for other disease endpoints were varied. For disease endpoints showing an increase in raw IRR, the increase was generally reduced when expressed as a relative change. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a composite control and stratification by risk group status can help elucidate the impact of PCV on non-IPD disease endpoints and in vulnerable population groups. We estimate a substantial reduction in the hospitalised burden of pneumococcal pneumonia in all age groups and pneumonia of unspecified cause, empyema and lung abscess in children under 15 years of age since PCV introduction. The increase in unspecified pneumonia in high-risk 65+ year olds may in part reflect their greater susceptibility to develop pneumonia from less pathogenic serotypes that are replacing vaccine types in the nasopharynx."

To determine whether the positive reaction was due to cross-reactivity, we separately tested the isolates from the pleural fluid samples, along with collection and reference strains. All patients had polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic positive cultures, including Parvimonas micra in every case. In all cases, 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction sequencing yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum. Samples for culture and specific polymerase chain reaction were negative for Streptococcus pneumoniae. We found that the false-positive PATB finding was likely due to P micra, a previously unknown cross-reactivity. In case of aspiration pneumonia risk factors, a positive PATB result must be interpreted with caution because there can be a false positivity due to anaerobic infection or co-infection."

The purpose of this study is to better characterize the bacteriology and demographics in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring surgery for empyema. All patients diagnosed with empyema preoperatively and had either a video-assisted thoracoscopic or open decortication surgery from January 2010 to September 2015 were reviewed. Forty-seven patients were identified with a mean age of 54.7 +- 16.8 years (X +- SD). Sixty per cent of patients had CAP. Anaerobes were the most common isolate at 21 per cent, followed by Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus (50% Methicillin Resistant). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were the next most frequent at 13 per cent. Hospital-acquired pneumonia patients had a higher incidence of S. aureus infections (P = 0.047). Cancer history had higher rates of both fungal (P = 0.004) and gram-negative infections (P = 0.03). Older patients had increased incidence of gram-negative infections (P = 0.05). The median length of stay for CAP patient who were intravenous drug abusers (n = 3) were 31 days (95% confidence interval (CI) [15, NA]), which was significantly longer than the others (median 12 days, 95% CI: [9, 18], P = 0.014). Streptococcus pneumoniae was not found in any of the isolates. Our data reveal that anaerobes and Staphylococcus species have replaced S. pneumoniae as the major regional pathogens in surgically treated empyema.

Most of the infection could be prevented through immunization by vaccines containing capsular polysaccharides but some infection may be caused by unencapsulated strains. METHODS: Clinical isolates of S.pneumoniae from January 2012 to December 2015 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Serotyping by PCR method was performed. Clinical and laboratory information of patients infected by non-typeable pneumococci (NTP) were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 39 NTP isolates were identified. Most (21 of 39, 53.9%) were collected from purulent upper respiratory tract secretion. Others were from corneal abscess, sputum, and one from blood of a newborn. We recorded a 3.6-fold increase in the rate of isolation from 1.4% in 2012 to 5.0% in 2015 (p = 0.063). Co-infection was found in 24 cases; the major co-infecting pathogens included non-typeable Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Most (39 of 40, 97.5%) of the isolates were susceptible to both penicillin and ceftriaxone. The dominant sequence type ST1106 and an emerging sequence type ST7502 were recognized. CONCLUSIONS: A gradual increase of NTP infection was found in northern Taiwan in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era. Non-typeable pneumococci can cause respiratory and ophthalmological mucosal infection. Invasive infection can occur in newborns or young infants. Most of the isolates remained susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone."

Antibiotic management decisions are made on the basis of little available data and without strong specific recommendations in guidelines. METHODS: This was an online survey of paediatric infectious diseases (PID) physicians disseminated by major international professional organisations, examining empiric and targeted antibiotic choice, switch to oral antibiotics and duration of treatment for two hypothetical cases of contrasting severity. RESULTS: This study included 183 responses, mostly from North America, Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Increased disease severity was significantly associated with broader-spectrum and combination empiric and targeted antibiotic treatment, empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage and both longer intravenous (IV) and total duration of antibiotic treatment. Empirical MRSA coverage was also associated with local prevalence. Clinical progress was most important for determining the timing of the switch from IV to oral antibiotics. Few respondents chose antibiotics with activity against organisms associated with atypical pneumonia (e.g. Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), and most did not choose agents that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g. clindamycin), even in the case of a severe invasive group A streptococcal infection. Some variation in targeted treatment choices reflected areas of uncertainty, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility breakpoints, comparative effectiveness of anti-staphylococcal penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins for serious S. aureus infections and linezolid and vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This international survey of PID physicians highlights the priority targets for clinical research to improve antibiotic treatment of CAP complicated by empyema. Interventions that might be studied include empirical antibiotic guidelines stratified by case severity, adjunctive empirical use of agents that inhibit protein synthesis (e.g. clindamycin) and approaches to encourage rapid IV-to-oral switch and shorter total antibiotic treatment."

Over recent years, the frequency of pleural empyema has increased in children with influenza infection. We present a severe case of acute empyema caused by S.pyogenes after influenza A infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 39-year old woman was diagnosed as influenza A and received oral Oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. She had no vaccination of influenza A. Although her influenza A infection improved, she complained of fever and cough to our institute. Chest radiography showed encapsulated pleural effusion of the left lung and pleural effusion which was consistent with acute empyema. Then, she was diagnosed as having acute empyema and was admitted to our institute. Streptococcus pyogenes was identified by pleural fluid culture on day 4. thus, MNZ was changed to clindamycin (CLDM) 600 mg three times a day. While thoracic drainage with intrapleural urokinase and combination antibiotic therapy of ceftriaxone and CLDM were performed, her general condition and chest radiographic findings were not improved. She received video-assisted thoracic debridement on day 10. After the operation, the antibiotic therapy was changed to ABPC 6 g daily iv. Due to good clinical course, the antibiotic therapy was switched to oral amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily on day 28. Then, she was discharged. CONCLUSION: Influenza A virus infection could lead to severe GAS infection, while the latter can occur in otherwise healthy individual as well. Physician must consider the possibility of severe GAS infection after influenza A infection."

We searched the literature to establish whether PCV13 reduces PnPE, and to identify other pathogens causing pleural empyemas (PEs). Material and methods: From October 2005 to January 2018 (12.3 years) we performed active surveillance for all cases of PE at the General Hospital of Tijuana, Mexico. Isolates from pleural fluid (PF) were identified by conventional culture, and since 2014, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was added for all culture-negative PFs. Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes were detected by either Quellung reaction (Statens Serum Institute ) or PCR. Clinical, imagenological, laboratorial and microbiological evaluation was performed on each patient. Statistical analysis was purely descriptive. Results: A total of 64 PEs were identified (5.28/year). Median age was 51 months (1-191), hospitalization days 18 (4-35). Decortication was performed in 42%, and two children died (3.2%). Bacterial identification was obtained from 51 (80%). S. pneumoniae was the leading cause (29 = 56.8%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14 = 27.4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3-5 = 9%) and others (5 = 9.8%). PCV13 was initiated in May 2012, and its impact on serotype-specific PnPE was 81% (much fewer than serotype 3) and for all PnPE 56.1%; however, for all PE -2.1% due to an increase of PE caused by S. aureus for all but one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Conclusions: Following 12.3 years of active surveillance, PCV13 has shown impact on both serotype-specific and all PnPEs; however, an increase of PEs by MRSA has emerged. Continuous surveillance is crucial to establish whether this epidemiological finding is transitory or not."

While culture-based studies have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens for identifying lower airway infection, none have used both together. We compared respiratory bacterial pathogens cultured from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures as the ""gold standard"" to better inform the diagnosis of lower airway infection in children with chronic wet cough. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and BAL fluid specimens were collected concurrently from consecutive children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for chronic cough and cultured for bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: In cultures from 309 children (median age, 2.3 years) with chronic endobronchial suppuration, all main pathogens detected (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were more prevalent in nasopharyngeal than oropharyngeal swabs (37%, 34%, and 23% vs 21%, 6.2%, and 3.2%, respectively). Positive and negative predictive values for lower airway infection by any of these three pathogens were 63% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 55, 70) and 85% (95% CI, 78, 91) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 65% (95% CI, 54, 75), and 66% (95% CI, 59, 72) for oropharyngeal swabs, and 61% (95% CI, 54,68), and 88% (95% CI, 81, 93) for both swabs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neither nasopharyngeal nor oropharyngeal swabs, alone or in combination, reliably predicted lower airway infection in children with chronic wet cough. Although upper airway specimens may be useful for bacterial carriage studies and monitoring antimicrobial resistance, their clinical utility in pediatric chronic lung disorders of endobronchial suppuration is limited."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:31031342TITLE:Pneumococcal disease burden from an Indian perspective: Need for its prevention in pulmonology practice.ABSTRACT:Globally, pneumococcal diseases are a significant public health concern. They are preventable and frequently occur among older adults. Major risk factors for the disease are extremes of age, alcohol intake, smoking, air pollution, and comorbid conditions (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and heart disease). Risk factors, coupled with limited disease-burden data and the emergence of antibiotics resistance, are hindering the effective management of the disease in older adults. Various global guidelines recommend pneumococcal vaccines for the prevention of pneumococcal diseases, as they reduce disease burden, hospitalization, and mortality rates among patients with comorbid conditions. Besides being an integral part of childhood immunization, these vaccines are advocated by various Indian healthcare bodies/groups for older and younger adults with certain medical conditions. The article presents an overview of the closed-door discussion by the Indian pulmonary experts on the scientific evidence and clinical practice followed for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in India."

METHODS: Risk analysis modelling was conducted using a multivariate risk formula. Literature reviews were conducted to generate global central estimates for each of the parameters of the risk formula in relation to the 2009 influenza pandemic, secondary pneumococcal pneumonia, rates of AMR, and pneumococcal vaccine efficacy as a component of pandemic preparedness. RESULTS: Global Streptococcus pneumoniae AMR was estimated at 21.8% to 27.6%, and contributed to 1.8% to 2.3% of deaths during the 2009 influenza pandemic. When directly applied to mortality due to multidrug resistance, pneumococcal vaccination could potentially prevent 1277 to 3754 deaths and could have reduced mortality from multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae to 1% to 1.2%. CONCLUSIONS: AMR in secondary pneumococcal infections contributed towards a small percentage of the global mortality during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Increased S. pneumoniae AMR could result in a three- to four-fold rise in mortality due to secondary pneumococcal infections in future influenza pandemics. Pneumococcal vaccination has an important role in preventing pneumococcal co-infections and combating AMR in all populations, and should be considered a key component of influenza pandemic preparedness or early action plans."

Different management approaches exist for this condition. We evaluated a 14-day treatment with amoxicillin (AMX) with/without clavulanic acid (AMC) confirmed or modified by microbiological findings from pleural tap. Children &lt;=16 years of age with radiologically diagnosed PPE/PE and initial diagnostic pleural tap were included at University Children's Hospital Zurich from 2001-2015. AMX/AMC was given for 14 days and rationalized according to microbiological pleural tap results. Clinical and radiological follow-up was scheduled until six months or full recovery. In 114 of 147 (78%) children with PPE/PE a pathogen was identified by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or antigen testing. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 90 (79%), S. pyogenes in 13 (11%), and Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases (6%), all but two cultured pathogens (96%) were sensitive to AMX/AMC. One-hundred two of 147 (69%) patients received treatment with AMX/AMC for 14 days. They recovered more rapidly than patients with a different management (p = 0.026). Of 139 children with follow-up, 134 (96%) patients fully recovered. In conclusion, 14-day AMX/AMC treatment confirmed and rarely modified by microbiological findings from pleural tap resulted in full recovery in &gt;95% of children with PPE/PE."

The purpose of this study was to access the bacterial cause of LRTIs in patients in Cameroon by two methods. Methods. Participants with LRTIs were enrolled in the referral centre for respiratory diseases in Yaounde city and its surroundings. To detect bacteria, specimens were tested by conventional bacterial culture and a commercial reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. One hundred forty-one adult patients with LRTIs were enrolled in the study. Among the participants, 46.8% were positive for at least one bacterium. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most detected bacteria with 14.2% (20/141) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9.2% (13/141), Staphylococcus aureus, 7.1% (10/141), and Moraxella catarrhalis, 4.3% (6/141). Bacterial coinfection accounted for 23% (14/61) with Haemophilus influenzae being implicated in 19.7% (12/61). The diagnostic performance of RT-PCR for bacteria detection (43.3%) was significantly different from that of culture (17.7%) (p&lt; 0.001). Only Streptococcus pneumoniae detection was associated with empyema by RT-PCR (p&lt;0.001). These findings enhance understanding of bacterial aetiologies in order to improve respiratory infection management and treatment.

We investigated patient parameters upon hospital admission to predict MP infection. Methods All patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital between 2013 and 2017 for CAP with a confirmed etiology were analyzed using logistic regression analyses and area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) for associations between demographic, clinical and laboratory features and the causative pathogen. Results We analyzed 568 patients with CAP, including 47 (8%) with MP; 152 (27%) with SP and 369 (65%) with influenza or other viruses. Comparing MP and SP by multivariate logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ration [OR] 0.56 per 10 years, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), a lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (OR 0.9, 0.82-0.99) and an elevated C-reactive protein/procalcitonin (CRP/PCT) ratio (OR 15.04 [5.23-43.26] for a 400 mg/mug cut-off) independently predicted MP. With a ROC curve AUC of 0.91 (0.80 for the &gt;400 mg/mug cutoff), the CRP/PCT ratio was the strongest predictor of MP vs. SP. The discriminatory value resulted from significantly lower PCT values (p &lt; 0.001) for MP, while CRP was high in both groups (p = 0.057). Comparing MP and viral infections showed similar results with again the CRP/PCT ratio providing the best information (AUC 0.83; OR 5.55 for the &gt;400 mg/mug cutoff, 2.26-13.64).

The aim of this study is to analyze the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in adults with bacteremic pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (BPP) after the introduction of PCVs in childhood, and the impact of age and comorbidity on this distribution. We conducted an observational study of all adults hospitalized with BPP between 2001 and 2014, in two tertiary hospitals. Overall, we identified 451 cases of BPP (2001-2005: 194, 2006-2010: 134, 2011-2014: 123). The rate of appearance of new cases decreased over the study period. In 70% of the cases, the serotypes found were among those included in PCV13. The most prevalent serotypes were 3 (23.1%), 7F (14.6%), 19A (8.4%) and 1 (7.5%). There was a significant trend to decrease in the percentage of BPP cases due to PCV7 from period 2001-2005 to 2011-2014 (p = 0.0166) and a significant trend to increase in the six serotypes added to form PCV 13 (p = 0.0003). Serotype 3 was the most frequent in patients who developed complications during hospitalization. We did not detect a significant increase in cases caused by non-PCV13 serotypes. The most frequent non-PCV13 serotype was 22F. In conclusion, a significant proportion of adults continue to develop BPP with vaccine serotypes despite infant pneumococcal vaccination. There is a need for further strategies to reduce the current burden of this disease on adults."

Bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) associated with this infection varied between geographical regions. Knowledge of the pathogens in a given area and their up-to-date AMR profile is essential for optimal management of patients. This study was aimed at assessing the type of bacterial isolates and their AMR among CAP adult patients at the Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 April to 30 July 2018. Demographic related data were collected from the study participants using a structured questionnaire. Sputum samples were collected and processed to identify pathogens using the conventional culture and biochemical tests as per the standard procedures. The Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method was implemented for the AMR testing. Descriptive and multivariable analysis was conducted using SPSS version 23. Results: Among 414 presumptively diagnosed study participants for CAP, bacterial pathogens were identified from 167 (40.3%) participants. Among these, multidrug resistance (MDR) accounted for 127(76%) of the isolates. The predominant isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae at 60(35.9%) and Klebsella pneumoniae at 30(18%). Overcrowded living conditions [AOR 1.579 (95%CI: 1.015-2.456)] and alcohol use [AOR 4.043 (95% CI, 2.537-6.443)] were found statistically associated with culture positive sputum. Conclusions: The study showed high prevalence of mono- and multi-drug resistant isolates in the study area. Therefore, regular surveillance of the type of isolates and their AMR patterns should be considered. Interventions for reducing community acquired pneumonia should be integrated with lifestyle factors related to household and alcohol use."

The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcomes of pHUS in children &lt;5 years of age since the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2006 and its replacement with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2010 in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Public Health England conducts enhanced national surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United Kingdom. Confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease cases diagnosed between September 1, 2006, and March 31, 2016, with hemolytic uremic syndrome reported as a complication were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There were 54 cases of pHUS during the surveillance period, with a median age of 17 months. The incidence of pHUS was 0.25/100,000 during the PCV7 period and 0.08/100,000 during the PCV13 period (incidence rate ratio: 0.31; 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.57; P &lt; 0.0001). Twelve children (22%) had an underlying comorbidity before disease onset. Overall, 31 (57%) presented with lower respiratory tract infection, 14 (25%) with meningitis, 8 (15%) with bacteremia and 1 (2%) with septic arthritis. An empyema was reported in 26/31 children (84%) with lower respiratory tract infection and cerebral abscess in 5/14 children (36%) with meningitis. The main responsible serotypes were 19A (n = 20), 3 (n = 6), 7F (n = 5) and 33F (n = 4). Eight children (15%) died, including 6 with meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: pHUS continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of pHUS was significantly lower after PCV13 replaced PCV7 in the childhood immunization program. Currently, most cases are due to non-PCV13 serotypes."

In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1-59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41 8% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99 7% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31 7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10 6-97 3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6 4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3 2%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33 9%] of 56). Almost all cases (98 9%) and controls (98 0%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61 4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 57 3-65 6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27 3% (23 3-31 6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5 9% (3 9-8 3). Viruses were less common (54 5%, 95% CrI 47 4-61 5 vs 68 0%, 62 7-72 7) and bacteria more common (33 7%, 27 2-40 8 vs 22 8%, 18 3-27 6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31 1%, 95% CrI 28 4-34 2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus-enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes. FUNDING: Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation."

We assessed the multinational prevalence and risk factors for DRSP-CAP in a multinational point-prevalence study. DESIGN: The prevalence of DRSP-CAP was assessed by identification of DRSP in blood or respiratory samples among adults hospitalized with CAP in 54 countries. Prevalence and risk factors were compared among subjects that had microbiological testing and antibiotic susceptibility data. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify risk factors independently associated with DRSP-CAP. RESULTS: 3,193 subjects were included in the study. The global prevalence of DRSP-CAP was 1.3% and continental prevalence rates were 7.0% in Africa, 1.2% in Asia, and 1.0% in South America, Europe, and North America, respectively. Macrolide resistance was most frequently identified in subjects with DRSP-CAP (0.6%) followed by penicillin resistance (0.5%).

This study describes the serotype distribution and clinical outcomes of Canadian adults aged &gt;=16 years, who were hospitalized with CAPSpn and IPD from 2010 to 2015. METHODS: Active surveillance for CAP and IPD was performed in adult hospitals across five Canadian provinces. IPD was identified when Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from sterile sites. Bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAPSpn were identified using blood culture, and sputum culture or PCV13-specific urine antigen detection (UADPCV13), respectively. Serotype was assigned using Quellung reaction, PCR, or UADPCV13. RESULTS: Of 6687 CAP cases where a test was performed, S. pneumoniae positivity decreased from 15.9% in 2011 to 8.8% in 2014, but increased to 12.9% in 2015. CAPSpn attributed to PCV13 serotypes followed a similar trend, dropping from 8.3% in 2010 to 4.6% in 2014, but increasing to 6.3% in 2015. The decline was primarily attributed to serotypes 7F and 19A, and the proportional increase to serotype 3. Similar trends were noted for bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAPSpn. Serious outcomes such as 30-day mortality, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were prominent in CAPSpn and IPD cases, but remained unchanged over the study years. CONCLUSION: Herd immunity afforded primarily by serotypes 7F and 19A appears to be partly masked by a concomitant proportional increase of serotype 3. Despite evidence of herd immunity, these PCV13 serotypes remain persistent in Canadian adults hospitalized with CAPSpn, and represent between 5 and 10% of all CAP in this patient population."

We previously clarified reductions in the proportions of PCV7-, PCV13-, and PPSV23-covered serotypes in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia after the initiation of PCV7 and PCV13 vaccinations for Japanese children; however, information about the annual changes in the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia after the initiation of routine PPSV23 vaccinations remains unclear. We retrospectively studied 229 adults with pneumococcal pneumonia which S. pneumoniae was cultured from their lower respiratory tract samples between 2011 and 2017 and investigated the annual changes in the proportion of S. pneumoniae serotypes. The proportion of PPSV23-covered serotypes decreased from 71.4% in 2011 to 52.2% in 2014, but it remained essentially unchanged from 2015 to 2017. The proportions of PCV7-covered serotypes decreased from 46.4% in 2011 to 4.3% in 2014; however, this rate increased beginning in 2015 and reached 20.6% in 2017. Among the PCV7-covered serotypes, the proportion of the 19F serotype increased from 2015 to 2017. In conclusion, there were no obvious changes in the proportion of PPSV23-covered and PCV13-covered serotypes in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia after the initiation of routine PPSV23 vaccinations."

This retrospective surveillance aimed to analyze serotype distribution, drug resistance, virulence factors, and molecular characteristics of pneumonia isolates from children in Shanghai, China. Methods: A total of 287 clinical pneumococcal isolates were collected from January to December in 2018 and were divided into community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) two groups according to where someone contracts the infection. All isolates were serotyped by multiplex sequential PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using E-test or disk diffusion method. The molecular epidemiology was analyzed using multilocus sequence typing and seven housekeeping genes were sequenced to identified the sequence types (STs). In addition, we investigated the presence of virulence genes via PCR. Results: The most common serotypes were 19F, 6A, 19A, 23F, 14, and 6B, and the coverage rates of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were 58.9, 58.9, and 80.5%, respectively. More PCV13/non-PCV7 serotypes and higher rate of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae were seen in HAP. Molecular epidemiological typing showed a high level of diversity and five international antibiotic-resistant clones were found, including Taiwan19F-14, Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Taiwan23F-15 and Sweden15A-25. No significant difference was observed in the presence of virulence genes among the isolates obtained from CAP and HAP. All of the S. pneumoniae isolates carried lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP, and the carriage rate of nanA and piaA were 96.2 and 99.0%. Conversely, cps2A, cbpA, and pspA were present in 33.8-44.3% of the isolates. Conclusions: Serotype changes and emerging multidrug-resistant international clones were found in current study. lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP may be good protein vaccine candidates. Long-term high-quality surveillance should be conducted to assess impact and effectiveness brought by vaccines, and provide a foundation for prevention strategies and vaccine policies."

We combined time series analysis of seasonality, climate-region, and clinical syndromes from 243,000 verbal autopsies in the nationally-representative Million Death Study. Pneumonia mortality at 1 month-14 years was greatest in January (Rate ratio (RR) 1.66, 99%CI 1.51-1.82; versus the April minimum). Higher RRs at 1-11 months suggested respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) etiology. India's humid subtropical region experienced a unique summer pneumonia mortality. Diarrhea mortality peaked in July (RR 1.66, 1.48-1.85) and January (RR 1.37, 1.23-1.48), while deaths with fever and bloody diarrhea (indicating enteroinvasive bacterial etiology) showed little seasonality. Combining mortality at ages 1-59-months in 2015 with prevalence surveys, we estimate 40,600 pneumonia deaths from Streptococcus pneumoniae, 20,700 from RSV, 12,600 from influenza, and 7,200 from Haemophilus influenzae type b and 24,700 diarrheal deaths from rotavirus.

Zimbabwe introduced 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2012 using a 3-dose infant schedule with no booster dose or catch-up campaign. We evaluated the impact of PCV13 on pediatric pneumonia and meningitis. METHODS: We examined annual changes in the proportion of hospitalizations due to pneumonia and meningitis among children aged &lt;5 years at Harare Central Hospital (HCH) pre-PCV13 (January 2010-June 2012) and post-PCV13 (July 2013-December 2016) using a negative binomial regression model, adjusting for seasonality. We also evaluated post-PCV13 changes in serotype distribution among children with confirmed pneumococcal meningitis at HCH and acute respiratory infection (ARI) trends using Ministry of Health outpatient data. RESULTS: Pneumonia hospitalizations among children aged &lt;5 years steadily declined pre-PCV13; no significant change in annual decline was observed post-PCV13. Post-PCV13 introduction, meningitis hospitalization decreased 30% annually (95% confidence interval [CI], -42, -14) among children aged 12-59 months, and no change was observed among children aged 0-11 months. Pneumococcal meningitis caused by PCV13 serotypes decreased from 100% in 2011 to 50% in 2016. Annual severe and moderate outpatient ARI decreased by 30% (95% CI, -33, -26) and 7% (95% CI, -11, -2), respectively, post-PCV13 introduction. CONCLUSIONS: We observed declines in pediatric meningitis hospitalizations, PCV13-type pneumococcal meningitis, and severe and moderate ARI outpatient visits post-PCV13 introduction. Low specificity of discharge codes, changes in referral patterns, and improvements in human immunodeficiency virus care may have contributed to the lack of additional declines in pneumonia hospitalizations post-PCV13 introduction."

However information regarding the contribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae to pneumonia causation in Mongolia is limited. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of hospitalized children aged 2-59 months with pneumonia, enrolled into a surveillance program in the period prior to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction, in Mongolia. METHODS: An expanded pneumonia surveillance program enrolled children, who met the surveillance case definition, at participating hospitals, between April 2015 and May 2016. Cumulative incidence rates were calculated by district for all pneumonia endpoints using district specific denominators from the Mongolian Health Department census for 2016. Socio-economic and disease-associated factors were compared between districts using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: A total of 4318 eligible children with pneumonia were enrolled over the 14 month period. Overall the incidence for all-cause pneumonia in children aged 12-59 months was 31.8 per 1000 population; children aged 2-11 months had an almost four-fold higher incidence than children aged 12-59 months. Differences were found between districts with regards to housing type, fuel used for cooking, hospital admission practices and the proportions of severe and primary endpoint pneumonia. DISCUSSION: This study shows a high burden of pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months in Mongolia prior to PCV introduction. Rates differed somewhat by district and age group and were influenced by a number of socio-economic factors. It will be important to consider these differences and risk factors when assessing the impact of PCV introduction."

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Pneumococcal vaccination guidelines from the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization in 2013 and 2016 constitute level III evidence for CAP prevention in the Canadian adult population. MAIN MESSAGE: It is recommended that immunosuppressed adults of all ages receive the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (grades A and B recommendations). In 2016, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization also recommended that all adults aged 65 years and older receive PCV13 (grade A recommendation) on an individual basis, followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (grade B recommendation). This update is based on a large clinical study that demonstrated PCV13 efficacy against vaccine-type CAP in this population. CONCLUSION: Physicians should focus on improving pneumococcal vaccination rates among adults, which remain low. Vaccination with PCV13 should also be considered for adults with chronic conditions, whose baseline risk is often higher than that for healthy individuals aged 65 years and older."

This epidemiological finding has generated debate regarding the effectiveness of PCV13 against serotype 3 disease. Evaluating PCV13 effectiveness against serotype 3 is especially critical in adults, where serotype 3 makes up an important amount of remaining pneumococcal disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the published literature to assess the direct effectiveness of PCV13 against serotype 3 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among adults. We then estimated overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a pooled analysis of the individual-level, raw data. RESULTS: Two published studies met inclusion criteria. One was a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2014. The other was a recently-published case-control study conducted in Louisville, Kentucky that used a test-negative design (TND). We also identified a third TND study conducted in Argentina that was recently presented as a conference abstract but is not yet published. All three studies were conducted in adults aged &gt;=65 years. PCV13 VE against serotype 3 hospitalized CAP was 52.5% (95%CI: 6.2-75.9%) from the pooled analysis of individual-level data from all three studies. Results were similar if the unpublished estimate was excluded (serotype 3 VE = 53.6% [95%CI: 6.7-76.9%]). No heterogeneity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Currently-available evidence, although limited to three studies, suggests that PCV13 provides direct protection against serotype 3 hospitalized CAP in adults aged &gt;=65 years."

The aim was to study presenting characteristics, clinical course and outcome of meningitis patients with co-existing pneumonia on admission. METHODS: We evaluated adult patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis with pneumonia on admission in a nationwide, prospective cohort preformed from March 2006 to June 2017. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify clinical characteristics predictive of pneumonia on admission, and to quantify the effect of pneumonia on outcome. RESULTS: Pneumonia was diagnosed on admission in 315 of 1852 (17%) bacterial meningitis episodes and confirmed by chest X-ray in 256 of 308 (83%) episodes. S. pneumoniae was the causative organism in 256 of 315 episodes (81%). Pneumonia on admission was associated with advanced age (OR 1.03 per year increase, 95% CI 1.02-1.04, P&lt;0.001), alcoholism (OR 1.96 95% CI 1.23-3.14, P=0.004), cancer (OR 1.54 95% CI 1.12-2.13, P=0.008), absence of otitis or sinusitis (OR 0.44 95% CI 0.32-0.59, P&lt;0.001) and S. pneumoniae (OR 2.14 95% CI 1.55-2.95, P&lt;0.001) in the multivariate analysis. An unfavourable outcome defined as a score of 1-4 on the Glasgow Outcome Scale was observed in 172 (55%) episodes and 87 patients (28%) died. Pneumonia on admission was independently associated with unfavourable outcome and mortality in the multivariate analysis (OR 1.48 95% CI 1.12-1.96; P=0.005).

In majority, infections trigger relapses requiring hospitalization with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the incidence, spectrum, and risk factors for major infections in hospitalized children with nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: All consecutive hospitalized children between 1-12 years of age with nephrotic syndrome were enrolled in the study. Children with acute nephritis, secondary nephrotic syndrome as well as those admitted for diagnostic renal biopsy and intravenous cyclophosphamide or rituximab infusion were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 148 children with 162 admissions were enrolled. Incidence of major infections in hospitalized children with nephrotic syndrome was 43.8%. Peritonitis was the commonest infection (24%), followed by pneumonia (18%), urinary tract infection (15%), and cellulitis (14%), contributing with two thirds of major infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 9) was the predominant organism isolated in children with peritonitis and pneumonia. On logistic regression analysis, serum albumin &lt; 1.5gm/dL was the only independent risk factor for all infections (OR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-6; p = 0.01), especially for peritonitis (OR 29; 95% CI, 3-270; p = 0.003). There were four deaths (2.5%) in our study, all due to sepsis and multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS: Infection remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children with nephrotic syndrome. As Pneumococcus was the most prevalent cause of infection in those children, attention should be paid to the pneumococcal immunization in children with nephrotic syndrome."

We examined whether community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP) in children carrying commonly recognized pneumonia invasive pneumococcal serotypes ([PnIST] 1, 5, 7F, 14, and 19A) differs from CAAP in children carrying less invasive serotypes (non-PnIST) or no Pnc (Pnc-neg). METHODS: Children <5 years, visiting the only regional Pediatric Emergency Room, with radiologically proven CAAP were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal cultures were processed for pneumococcal isolation and serotyping. Clinical and demographic characteristics were recorded. The study was conducted before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine implementation in Israel. RESULTS: A total of 1423 CAAP episodes were recorded: PnIST, 300 (21.1%); non-PnIST, 591 (41.5%); and Pnc-neg, 532 (37.4%). After adjustment for age, ethnicity, seasonality, and previous antibiotics, the following variables were positively associated with PnIST carriage compared with both groups: temperature >=39 C, peripheral white blood cell count >=20 000/mm3, C-reactive protein >=70.0 mg/L, and serum sodium <135 mEq/L. Lower oxygen saturation, viral detection, and comorbidities were negatively associated with Pn-IST carriage (odds ratios, <1.0). Differences between non-PnIST carriers and Pnc-neg groups were smaller or nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Young children with CAAP carrying common PnIST had a lower proportion of comorbidities, hypoxemia, and viral detection and had more intense systemic inflammatory response than those carrying non-PnIST or not carrying Pnc."

METHODS: We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study of adults admitted to two large university hospitals with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) between September 2013 and August 2018. Pneumococcal serotypes were identified using a novel 24-valent urinary monoclonal antibody assay and from blood cultures. Trends in incidence rates were compared against national invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) data. Persons at risk of vaccine-type pneumonia (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)13 and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV)23) were determined from multivariate analyses. FINDINGS: Of 2934 adults hospitalised with CAP, 1075 (36.6%) had pneumococcal pneumonia. The annual incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia increased from 32.2 to 48.2 per 100 000 population (2013-18), predominantly due to increases in PCV13non7-serotype and non-vaccine type (NVT)-serotype pneumonia (annual incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.21 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28, respectively). Incidence trends were broadly similar to IPD data. PCV13non7 (56.9% serotype 3) and PPV23non13 (44.1% serotype 8) serotypes were identified in 349 (32.5%) and 431 (40.1%) patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, respectively. PCV13-serotype pneumonia (dominated by serotype 3) was more likely in patients in the UK pneumococcal vaccination clinical risk group (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.28) while PPV23-serotype pneumonia was more likely in patients outside the clinical risk group (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.10). INTERPRETATION: The incidence of pneumococcal CAP is increasing, predominantly due to NVT serotypes and serotype 3. PPV23-serotype pneumonia is more likely in adults outside currently identified clinical risk groups."

The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the clinical syndromes, prognostic factors and outcomes for pneumococcal disease in adults and children in Singapore during the period before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine. We retrospectively analyzed a large cohort of patients admitted to the four main public hospitals in Singapore with S. pneumoniae infection between 1997 and 2013. A total of 889 (64% of all isolates identified in the clinical laboratories) cases were included in the analysis; 561 (63.1%) were adult (>=16 years) cases with a median age of 62 years and 328 (36.9%) were paediatric cases with a median age of 3 years. Bacteraemic pneumonia was the most common syndrome in both groups (69.3% vs. 44.2%), followed by primary bacteraemia without pneumonia (14.3% vs. 13.4%), meningitis (6.4% vs. 7.6%) and non-bacteraemic pneumonia (5.2% vs. 21%). The major serotypes in adults were 3, 4, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F whereas in children they were 14, 6B and 19F, accounting both for nearly half of pneumococcal disease cases. No particular serotype was associated with mortality or severity of the pneumococcal disease. Overall mortality rate was 18.5% in adults and 3% in children. Risk factors for mortality included acute cardiac events in adults, meningitis in children and critical illness and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in both adults and children. Penicillin resistance was not associated with increased mortality. Our results agree with global reports that the course of pneumococcal disease and its clinical outcome were more severe in adults than in children. The main serotypes causing invasive disease were mostly covered by the vaccines in use. The high mortality rates reflect an urgent need to increase vaccination coverage in both adults and children to tackle this vaccine-preventable infection."

Increasing antibiotic resistance among the common bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococci, has made its empirical treatment increasingly problematic, highlighting the need for effective antibiotic therapy.Areas covered: We searched PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for English-language reports of phase III clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2019 concerning the antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. We provide a summary of the latest approved drugs for this indication and highlight emerging drugs with a potential indication.Expert opinion: Ceftaroline (a new cephalosporine) and omadacycline (a cycline alternative), either parenterally or orally, are the only two new antibiotics to have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the last five years. Among the antimicrobials in development, Lefamulin (the first pleuromutilin), is currently in phase III development. Among the known antibiotic classes, solithromycin (a macrolide), nemonoxacin (a quinolone), and delafloxacin and zabofloxacin (both fluoroquinolones), have been studied in phase II and III in clinical trials.

Despite 34 countries introducing the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which reduces the risk of pneumococcal carriage (a prerequisite for disease) of some of the most pathogenic pneumococcal serotypes, it remains uncertain whether they will achieve the sustained direct or indirect protection necessary to reduce pneumococcal carriage to levels sufficient to interrupt transmission and disease. We will therefore summarise the available data on the impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in reducing vaccine serotype carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia in Africa between 2000 and 2019. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a predetermined search strategy, we will conduct a comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE database, the Excerpta Medica Database, the ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index), Scopus and the African Index Medicus to identify published studies reporting the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage (vaccine type and non-vaccine type), incidence rates of pneumococcal pneumonia and mortality among children, adults and HIV-infected (all-ages) pre-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and post-PCV introduction (published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2019) in African countries that have introduced PCVs (PCV7/PCV10/PCV13) in their routine national immunisation programme. The studies retained and data extracted will be assessed for bias using prevalidated tools and checklists. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed using the chi2 test on Cochrane Q statistic. A random effect meta-analysis will be used to estimate the overall prevalence of pneumococcal carriage and incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia across studies with similar characteristics. Results will be reported in compliance with the Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

METHODS: In a nationwide pediatric hospital surveillance study in Germany we identified 584 children &lt;18 years of age with bacteriologically confirmed PPE/PE from October 2010 to June 2018. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified by culture and/or PCR of blood samples and/or pleural fluid and serotyped. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae was identified in 256 of 584 (43.8%) children by culture (n = 122) and/or PCR (n = 207). The following pneumococcal serotypes were detected in 114 children: serotype 3 (42.1%), 1 (25.4%), 7F (12.3%), 19A (7.9%), other PCV13 serotypes (4.4%) and non-PCV13 serotypes (7.9%). Between October 2010 and June 2014 serotype 1 (38.1%) and serotype 3 (25.4%) were most prevalent, whereas between July 2014 and June 2018 serotype 3 (62.7%) and non-PCV13 serotypes (15.7%) were dominant. Compared to children with other pneumococcal serotypes, children with serotype 3 associated PPE/PE were younger (median 3.2 years [IQR 2.1-4.3 years] vs. median 5.6 years [IQR 3.8-8.2 years]; p &lt; 0.001) and more frequently admitted to intensive care (43 [89.6%] vs. 48 [73.8%]; p = 0.04). Seventy-six of 114 (66.7%) children with pneumococcal PPE/PE had been vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccines. Thirty-nine of 76 (51.3%) had received a vaccine covering the serotype detected. Thirty of these 39 breakthrough cases were age-appropriately vaccinated with PCV13 and considered vaccine failures, including 26 children with serotype 3, three children with serotype 19A and one child with serotype 1. CONCLUSION: Following the introduction of PCV13 in general childhood vaccination we observed a strong emergence of serotype 3 associated PPE/PE in the German pediatric population, including a considerable number of younger children with serotype 3 vaccine breakthrough cases and failures. Future PCVs should not only cover newly emerging serotypes, but also include a more effective component against serotype 3."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:31761885TITLE:Comparison between Patients with Chest Infection due to Klebsiella spp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae.ABSTRACT:Objective In Japan, the aging demographic structure is becoming pronounced, and the full-blown graying of society appears not far off, which indicates an increasing population that will require healthcare contact. Klebsiella spp. are major pathogens in healthcare-associated infections, and their importance is increasing. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of Klebsiella spp. chest infections by evaluating the differences in the characteristics of chest infections caused by Klebsiella spp. and pneumoniae. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients hospitalized with pneumonia, lung abscess/necrotizing pneumonia, and empyema due to Klebsiella spp. and S. pneumoniae for 15 years at our institution in Saitama, Japan. Patients Patients with chest infections due to Klebsiella spp. (K group, n=76) and S. pneumoniae (S group, n=446) were included. Results The K group more frequently was male, older, coinfected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and had diabetes mellitus, a history of upper digestive system surgery, alcohol drinking habit, a smoking habit, and an impaired premorbid performance status than the S group. The percentages of lung abscesses or necrotizing pneumonia (31.6% vs. 0.9%) and empyema without pulmonary parenchymal shadow (3.9% vs. 0.7%) were higher in the K group than those in the S group. Severity on admission and mortality did not differ between the groups; however, patients in the K group required a longer duration of antibiotics administration and hospital stay than those in the S group. Conclusion Klebsiella spp. chest infections have some marked characteristics when compared with pneumococcal infections, and our results serve to differentiate Klebsiella spp. infection from pneumococcal infection."

Universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has changed the epidemiology of IPD. In vaccinated children, IPD can be a marker of an underlying immunodeficiency. METHODS: This is a retrospective audit of children younger than 18 years with IPD admitted to 2 tertiary pediatric hospitals in Australia between 2011 and 2017. Data on predisposing conditions, immunologic evaluation, pneumococcal serotype, antibiotic susceptibility and treatment were collected. RESULTS: During the 7-year period, there were 131 presentations with IPD in 127 children; 3 children had recurrent IPD. Patients presented with sepsis (41%), empyema (29%), meningitis (18%), mastoiditis (12%), pneumonia (10%) and septic arthritis (4%). In 19 (15%) presentations, risk factors for IPD were present, including malignancy, hematologic disorder, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease and cochlear implant. Pneumococcal serotypes were determined in 78/131 (60%) of presentations: the most frequent serotypes were 19A (19%), 3 (13%), 7F (10%) and 19F (8%) and non-vaccine serotypes 22F (8%), 35B (6%), 15A (4%) and 38 (4%). Overall, 11% of isolates were non-susceptible to ceftriaxone. Only 36 patients (32%) had an immunologic evaluation, and 4 patients had proven or probable immunodeficiency. CONCLUSION: Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes 19A, 3, 19F and 7F remain frequent causes of IPD, non-vaccine serotypes are emerging. Our data support vancomycin treatment for children with pneumococcal meningitis given 11% of our isolates were not susceptible to ceftriaxone. It is important to consider underlying conditions predisposing to IPD in a population with high rates of pneumococcal vaccination."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:31843863TITLE:Asthma and the Risk of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease: A Meta-analysis.ABSTRACT:CONTEXT: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumonia are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of IPD or pneumonia among children with asthma after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases were searched. STUDY SELECTION: We selected all cohorts or case-control studies of IPD and pneumonia in populations who already received PCV (largely 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), but not 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide, in which authors reported data for children with asthma and in which healthy controls were included, without language restriction. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently reviewed all studies. Primary outcomes were occurrence of IPD and pneumonia. Secondary outcomes included mortality, hospital admissions, hospital length of stay, ICU admission, respiratory support, costs, and additional medication use. RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria; of those, 3 retrospective cohorts (~26 million person-years) and 1 case-control study (N = 3294 children) qualified for the meta-analysis. Children with asthma had 90% higher odds of IPD than healthy controls (odds ratio = 1.90; 95% confidence interval = 1.63-2.11; I2 = 1.7%). Pneumonia was also more frequent among children with asthma than among controls, and 1 study reported that pneumonia-associated costs increased by asthma severity. LIMITATIONS: None of the identified studies had information of asthma therapy or compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Despite PCV vaccination, children with asthma continue to have a higher risk of IPD than children without asthma. Further research is needed to assess the need for supplemental 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination in children with asthma, regardless of their use of oral steroids."

METHODS: We studied 4438 cases aged 20-65 from a Swedish registry of invasive infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The case index date was the date the infection was diagnosed. Six controls for each case, matched for gender, age and region of residency, were selected from the Swedish population registry. Each control was assigned the index date of their corresponding case to define the study observation period. We linked cases and controls to the Swedish registries for socioeconomic status (SES), occupational history and hospital discharge. We applied a job-exposure matrix to characterise occupational exposures. We used conditional logistic analyses, adjusted for comorbidities and SES, to estimate the OR of IPD and the subgroup pneumonia-IPD, associated with selected occupations and exposures in the year preceding the index date. RESULTS: Welders manifested increased risk of IPD (OR 2.99, 95% CI 2.09 to 4.30). Occupational exposures to fumes and silica dust were associated with elevated odds of IPD (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.21 and OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.58, respectively). Risk associated with IPD with pneumonia followed a similar pattern with the highest occupational odds observed among welders and among silica dust exposed. CONCLUSION: Work specifically as a welder, but also occupational exposures more broadly, increase the odds for IPD. Welders, and potentially others with relevant exposures, should be offered pneumococcal vaccination."

METHODS: Between January and December 2017, children aged 2-59 months with chest radiography-confirmed CAP were enrolled. The parents were interviewed to collect information on the patients and home-based medication. Clinical information was derived from the patient files. Nasopharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected for isolation of the causative pathogens. Swab samples were analysed by quantitative PCR whereas blood samples were tested using BacT/Alert 3D. RESULTS: Overall, 109 children with CAP were included in this analysis. Provision of care to most children was delayed (median = 4.6 days). A quarter (26.6%) were given unprescribed/leftover antibiotics at home. Only one child had positive bacterial culture. Referrals were associated with nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (p = 0.003) and Haemophilus influenzae (p = 0.004). Of all admitted children, more than a quarter (n = 29) did not need to be hospitalised and inappropriately received injectable instead of oral antibiotics. CONCLUSION: We found high rates of home treatment, particularly with antibiotics. Appropriate health care was delayed for most children because of home treatment. Efforts are needed at the community level to improve awareness of antimicrobial resistance."

Children's demographic and clinical characteristics and vaccination status were obtained through a questionnaire. Sp and Hi were identified by culture and PCR. Pneumococcal strains were tested for antimicrobial (non-)susceptibility by disc diffusion and serotyped by Quellung-reaction (Quellung-reaction and PCR for serotypes 3, 6A, 19A).ResultsThe carriage prevalence of Sp (> 75%) remained stable over the successive periods but that of Hi increased (87.4%, 664 Hi-carriers/760 in 2016 vs 93.9%, 895/953 in 2017-2018). The proportion of non-PCV13 vaccine serotypes decreased (94.6%, 438 isolates/463 in 2016 vs 89.7%, 599/668 in 2017-2018) while that of PCV13-non-PCV10 vaccine serotypes (3 + 6A + 19A) increased (0.9%, 4 isolates/463 in 2016 vs 7.8%, 52/668 in 2017-2018), with serotype 19A most frequently identified (87.9%, 58/66 isolates). Non-susceptibility of pneumococci against any of the tested antibiotics was stable over the study period (> 44%).ConclusionsDuring and after the PCV13-to-PCV10 vaccine switch, the proportion of non-PCV13 serotypes decreased, mainly due to a serotype 19A carriage prevalence increase. These results complement invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance data, providing further basis for pneumococcal vaccination programme policy making."

We measured population-based incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) prior to introduction of PCV-10 to provide a benchmark against which the impact of PCV-10 can be assessed. METHODS: We conducted population, facility and laboratory-based surveillance in children 0-59 months of age in three rural sub-districts of Sylhet district of Bangladesh from January 2014 to June 2015. All children received two-monthly home visits with one week recall for morbidity and care seeking. Children attending the three Upazilla Health Complexes (UHC, sub-district hospitals) in the surveillance area were screened for suspected IPD. Blood samples were collected from suspected IPD cases for culture and additionally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from suspected meningitis cases for culture and molecular testing. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotyping of cases detected by molecular testing was done by sequential multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Children under surveillance contributed to 126,657 child years of observations. Sixty-three thousand three hundred eighty-four illness episodes were assessed in the UHCs. Blood specimens were collected from 8,668 suspected IPD cases and CSF from 177 suspected meningitis cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 46 cases; 32 (70%) were vaccine serotype. The population-based incidence of IPD was 36.3/100,000 child years of observations. About 80% of the cases occurred in children below two years of age. DISCUSSION: IPD was common in rural Bangladesh suggesting the potential benefit of an effective vaccine. Measurement of the burden of IPD requires multiple surveillance modalities."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the a) aetiology, b) factors associated with bacterial pneumonia and c) association between co-infections (bacteria + virus) and severity of disease, in children admitted with severe pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study involving children aged 1-month to 5-years admitted with very severe pneumonia, as per the WHO definition, over 2 years. Induced sputum and blood obtained within 24 hrs of admission were examined via PCR, immunofluorescence and culture to detect 17 bacteria/viruses. A designated radiologist read the chest radiographs. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with a mean (SD) age of 14 (+-15) months old were recruited. Significant pathogens were detected in 62% of patients (n = 186). Viruses alone were detected in 23.7% (n = 71) with rhinovirus (31%), human metapneumovirus (HMP) [22.5%] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16.9%] being the commonest. Bacteria alone was detected in 25% (n = 75) with Haemophilus influenzae (29.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (24%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.7%) being the commonest. Co-infections were seen in 13.3% (n = 40) of patients. Male gender (AdjOR 1.84 [95% CI 1.10, 3.05]) and presence of crepitations (AdjOR 2.27 [95% CI 1.12, 4.60]) were associated with bacterial infection. C-reactive protein (CRP) [p = 0.007]) was significantly higher in patients with co-infections but duration of hospitalization (p = 0.77) and requirement for supplemental respiratory support (p = 0.26) were not associated with co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria remain an important cause of very severe pneumonia in developing countries with one in four children admitted isolating bacteria alone. Male gender and presence of crepitations were significantly associated with bacterial aetiology. Co-infection was associated with a higher CRP but no other parameters of severe clinical illness."

Postoperatively, he required mechanical circulatory support with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and an intra-aortic balloon pump. Several days after surgery, new mitral and aortic paraprosthetic leaks (PPLs) developed. These were managed conservatively, initially, but eventually required percutaneous closure 6 weeks after the initial operation. This has enabled the patient to recover to independent mobility, 20 weeks after the operation. This case illustrates a rare clinical syndrome and the devastating impact of IE. Moreover, it illustrates the successful application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in postcardiotomy cardiac failure and the successful treatment of PPL in a patient unfit for redo surgery."

The pathogens of the disease may change for the misuse of antibiotics and the application of vaccines. Therefore, pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics may have changed. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogens positive in hospitalized children with S/L-PP and their association with clinical characteristics. METHOD: The current study analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pathogens positive in children with S/L-PP under 14 years old at a single hospital between 1st Jan 2014 and 31st Dec 2018 retrospectively. The pathogens were detected by microbial cultivation, indirect immunofluorescence of the kit (PNEUMOSLIDE IgM), Elisa, and/or real-time PCR in the samples of the patients. RESULTS: A total of 593 children with S/L-PP received treatment at a single hospital during the study period by inclusion criteria. Four hundred fifty-one patients were single positive for one pathogen and 83 patients were positive for at least 2 pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) (72.34%) was the most commonly detected pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae) (8.77%). The prevalence of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time (p < 0.05). The positive rate of M.pneumoniae increased with ages of patients (p < 0.05). M.pneumoniae was statistically associated with the extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was statistically associated with abnormal white blood cells (WBCs) and C reactive proteins (CRPs) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M.pneumoniae was the most positive pathogen in children with S/L-PP. The positive rate of M.pneumoniae in children with S/L-PP increased with time and the ages of children. M.pneumoniae was associated with extrapulmonary manifestations while S.pneumoniae was associated with abnormal WBCs and CRPs."

Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for many community infections, with the main ones being pneumonia and meningitis. Pneumococcus has developed increased resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. The evolution of antibiotic resistance in pneumococcus was influenced by changes in serotype distribution under vaccine selection pressure.Aim. The aim of this study was to determine the genes involved in macrolide resistance, the antimicrobial susceptibility, the serotype distribution and the spread of international antibiotic-resistant clones among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae.Methodology. We investigated 86 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains isolated from respiratory (n=74) or non-respiratory (n=12) samples in Tunisia. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the disk diffusion method. Macrolide-resistant strains were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ermA, ermB, mefA and msrD. We also investigated the macrolide resistance mechanisms in eight isolates (9.3%) by sequencing the L4 and L22 riboprotein-coding genes, plus relevant segments of the three 23S rRNA genes. Capsular serotypes were detected by multiplex PCR. Sequence types (STs) were explored using multilocus sequence typing (MLST).Results. Among the 86 studied strains, 70 (81.4 %) were resistant to penicillin G. The prevalent serotypes were 19F, 14, 19A and 23F. We observed that the cMLSB phenotype (66/86, 76.7%) was the most common in these pneumococci. In addition, ermB was the most frequent resistance gene. No mutation in ribosomal protein L22 or L4 or 23S rRNA was detected. Overall, 44 STs were identified in this study, including 16 that were described for the first time. Resistance to lincomycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was observed in 55 (64 %), 34 (39.5 %) and 31 (36 %) isolates, respectively. Furthermore, an increase in fluoroquinolone use in particular may lead to the emergence of levofloxacin-resistant strains. Multidrug resistance was observed in 83 isolates (96.5%). Three global antibiotic-resistant clones were identified: Denmark14 ST230, Portugal19F ST177 and Spain9V ST156.Conclusion. This study shows that macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae isolated in Tunisia is mainly related to target site modification. Our observations demonstrate a high degree of genetic diversity and capsular types among strains resistant to macrolides."

In the adult community, the most common pathogen in the disease is Streptococcus pneumonia, though other multiple etiological agents (atypical) have been involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. The genus Moraxella consists of aerobic, oxidase-positive gram-negative coccobacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis is known to be a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and has been implicated as an etiologic agent in multiple diseases of the respiratory tract (but not limited to), such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis. The species Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen, which has been found to cause several human diseases and infections such as meningitis, vaginitis, sinusitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. However, due to the subject's rarity, there is a paucity of information in the medical literature regarding its clinical significance, epidemiological data and appropriate therapy. We present the first case reported in Israel of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a patient with multiple co-morbidities including C. difficile infection (CDI) carrier state which presented with clinical symptoms (supported by radiological features) of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics including a 3rd generation cephalosporin and a macrolide that were substituted with IV Augmentin (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid) according to the organism's sensitivity tests.

Aim of this study was analysis of patients residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and developing pneumonia to reach a better knowledge of criteria for hospitalization and outcomes. MATERIALS/METHODS: this is a prospective, observational study in which patients residing in 3 LTCFs (metropolitan area of Rome, Italy) and developing pneumonia, hospitalized or treated in LTCF, were recruited and followed up from January 2017 to June 2019. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, secondary endpoint was analysis of risk factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: Overall, 146 episodes of NHAP were enrolled in the study: 57 patients were treated in LTCF, while 89 patients were hospitalized. Overall incidence rates of NHAP varied from 2.6 to 7.5 per 1000 residents. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (25%), and in 28 (55%) patients was documented a MDR pathogen. For hospitalized patients was reported a higher 30-day mortality (43.8% Vs 7%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that severe pneumonia, neoplasm, chronic hepatitis, antibiotic monotherapy, and malnutrition were independent risk factors for hospitalization from LTCF. MDR pathogen, severe pneumonia, COPD, and moderate to severe renal disease were independently associated with death at 30 days. CONCLUSION: frail elderly patients in LTCF have a high risk of MDR etiology with a higher risk to receive an inadequate antibiotic therapy and a fatal outcome. These results point to the need for increased provision of acute care and strategies in LTCF."

Both needed intensive care for invasive respiratory support. Despite extensive pleural involvement in both cases, only one required thoracic surgery. Case 1 also developed anaemia, hyponatraemia and hypo-albuminaemia, resulting in generalised oedema. Despite the severe morbidity, both boys made a full recovery. The diagnosis of NP should always be considered in a child with pneumonia who remains unwell despite 72 hours of appropriate antibiotics, particularly if there is evidence of pleural disease. Although S. pneumoniae is the main agent for NP, the influenza virus may be a precipitating factor."

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2 to 59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. RESULTS: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

However, seasonal variation as a risk factor for the development of postoperative pneumonia remains to be investigated. We sought to investigate whether patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during ""flu season"" (Fall and Winter months) at increased risk of postoperative pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing CABG in the National Inpatient Sample between 2005 and 2015 was completed. Concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were defined to include pneumonia secondary to several known pathogens. Outcomes with significant differences between Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer groups were further analyzed with additive time series decomposition. Odds ratios were generated and adjusted for age, sex, elective status, and 29 other Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comorbidity measures. RESULTS: A total of 238 757 and 277 941 patients undergoing CABG during Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer, respectively, were identified. A significantly increased risk of postoperative pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.15) and infection with influenza (aOR = 4.08), Haemophilus influenzae (aOR = 1.40), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (aOR = 1.47) was observed among patients receiving CABG in Q1 (January-March) compared to Q3 (July-September). CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong seasonality in the incidence of postoperative pneumonia after CABG which may persist across other cardiothoracic surgeries. In addition to optimizing infection control and perioperative care, cardiac surgeons should consider preoperative vaccination against seasonal influenza, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae to improve outcomes among high-risk patients."

METHODS: The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health Project (PERCH), a multi-country case-control study, evaluated the etiology of hospitalized cases of severe and very severe pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months. The PERCH Thailand site enrolled children during January 2012-February 2014. We determined pneumococcal colonization prevalence and density, and serotype distribution of colonizing isolates. RESULTS: We enrolled 224 severe/very severe pneumonia cases and 659 community controls in Thailand. Compared to controls, cases had lower colonization prevalence (54.5% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.12) and lower median colonization density (42.1 vs. 210.2 x 103 copies/mL, p <0.0001); 42% of cases had documented antibiotic pretreatment vs. 0.8% of controls. In no sub-group of assessed cases did pneumococcal colonization density exceed the median for controls, including cases with no prior antibiotics (63.9x103 copies/mL), with consolidation on chest x-ray (76.5x103 copies/mL) or with pneumococcus detected in whole blood by PCR (9.3x103 copies/mL). Serotype distribution was similar among cases and controls, and a high percentage of colonizing isolates from cases and controls were serotypes included in PCV10 (70.0% and 61.8%, respectively) and PCV13 (76.7% and 67.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal colonization is common among children aged <5 years in Thailand. However, colonization density was not higher among children with severe pneumonia compared to controls. These results can inform discussions about PCV introduction and provide baseline data to monitor PCV impact after introduction in Thailand."

However, recent clinical studies describing patient characteristics and outcomes for SP infection in adults requiring hospitalization are lacking. Our goal was to evaluate patient characteristics, contemporary antibiotic resistance, and clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults with SP infections.A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (1350 beds) in St. Louis, Missouri, USA for years 2012 through 2016. During the study period, 358 hospitalized adults, excluding those with meningitis, were identified with SP infection. Forty-four patients (12.3%) died within 30 days of the identification of their infection. Among these infections, 99 (27.7%) were assessed to be hospital-acquired and 259 (72.3%) were community-onset infections. The majority of infections involved the respiratory tract (88.5%). Azithromycin resistance was the most common antibiotic resistance at 51.4%, followed by enteral penicillin resistance (45.3%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (34.1%), second-generation cephalosporin (cefuroxime) (30.7%), and meropenem (22.6%). There were 70 isolates (19.6%) classified as multidrug resistant. Independent predictors of hospital mortality included increasing weight in 1-kilogram increments (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.02; P = .048), increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (AOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 - 1.42; P = .001), and the presence of septic shock (AOR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.31 - 6.57; P = .009). The median [interquartile range] hospital length of stay was 8.1 days [4.5 days, 16.8 days].Hospitalized patients with infection attributed to SP have significant 30-day mortality and use of hospital resources. Antibiotic resistance is common among isolates associated with infection. Determinants of mortality are primarily severity of illness, underlying comorbidities and increasing patient weight. Efforts to improve the treatment and prevention of SP infections are needed."

In this retrospective study, 257 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu Province were enrolled from January 22 to February 2, 2020. They were re-confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and tested for 39 respiratory pathogens. In total, 24 respiratory pathogens were found among the patients, and 242 (94.2 %) patients were co-infected with one or more pathogens. Bacterial co-infections were dominant in all COVID-19 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The highest and lowest rates of co-infections were found in patients aged 15-44 and below 15, respectively. Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease. In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases.

The risk of CAP is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is increased in HIV-infected patients. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for these patients in France. The objective was a large survey of pneumococcal vaccination coverage (PVC) by general practitioners (GPs) in these patients in France.Diagnosis and treatment forms were extracted from the database of 2000 GPs. The GPs and population panels were representative of the metropolitan populations. The primary endpoint was the comparison of PVC in the adult patients diagnosed with COPD, CHF, DM, or HIV infection during the study (April 2013-April 2017) and the control (March 2012-March 2013) periods.Of the 17,865 and 4,690 patients identified, 756 (4%) and 267 (6%) were vaccinated, respectively. During the study period, the PVC was significantly higher (35/282, 12%) in HIV-infected patients and lower in patients with DM (95/5994, 2%) than in other patients. Even though French pneumococcal vaccine recommendations in adults were updated in 2013, the PVC did not increase according to the years of the study period and slightly increased according to time after diagnosis.S. pneumoniae is responsible only for some CAP and meningitis, and incomplete protection by vaccine, hesitancy from practitioners and patients, and the moving schedule of vaccination could explain the results. New tools and/or strategies must be implemented to increase PVC in France.Abbreviations: CAP: community-acquired pneumonia; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; CHF: congestive heart failure; DM: diabetes mellitus; IPD: invasive pneumococcal disease; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; PVC: pneumococcal vaccination coverage; PCV7: 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PCV13: 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PPSV23: 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; GPs: general practitioners; CLM: Cegedim Logiciels Medicaux; MLM: monLogicielMedical; ICD-10: International Classification of Diseases; CNIL: Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertes; HPV: human papillomavirus; HBV: hepatitis B virus."

The three main pathogens involved in pleural empyema in children are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus. METHODS: A questionnaire according to the DELPHI method was sent to experts in the field (paediatric pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists) in France with the purpose of reaching a consensus on the conservative antibiotic treatment of pleural empyema in children. Two rounds were completed as part of this DELPHI process. RESULTS: Our work has shown that in the absence of clinical signs of severity, the prescription of an intravenous monotherapy is consensual but there is no agreement on the choice of drug to use. A consensus was also reached on treatment adjustment based on the results of blood cultures, the non-systematic use of a combination therapy, the need for continued oral therapy and the lack of impact of pleural drainage on infection control. On the other hand, after the second round of DELPHI, there was no consensus on the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and on the treatment of severe pleural empyema, especially when caused by Staphylococci. CONCLUSIONS: The result of this work highlights the needed for new French recommendations based on the evolution of microbial epidemiology in the post PCV13 era."

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. After recognizing the possible pathogens causing co-infection among COVID-19 patients, appropriate antimicrobial agents can be recommended."

Identification and characterization of pathogens that cause infections are crucial for accurate treatment and accelerated recovery. However, in most cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, which is partly due to the limited spectrum of pathogens covered by current diagnostics based on nucleic acid amplification. Therefore, in this study, we explored the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the diagnosis of children with severe pneumonia. From April to July 2017, 32 hospitalized children with severe nonresponding pneumonia in Shenzhen Children's Hospital were included in this study. Blood tests were conducted immediately after hospitalization to assess cell counts and inflammatory markers, oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify common pathogens by qPCR and culture. After bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for further pathogen identification using standardized diagnostic tests and mNGS. Blood tests were normal in 3 of the 32 children. In 9 oropharyngeal swabs, bacterial pathogens were detected, in 5 of these Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected. Adenovirus was detected in 5 BALF samples, using the Direct Immunofluorescence Assay (DFA). In 15 cases, no common pathogens were found in BALF samples, using the current standard diagnostic tests, while in all 32 BALFs, pathogens were identified using mNGS, including adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, cytomegalovirus and bocavirus. This study shows that, with mNGS, the sensitivity of detection of the causative pathogens in children with severe nonresponding pneumonia is significantly improved. In addition, mNGS gives more strain specific information, helps to identify new pathogens and could potentially help to trace and control outbreaks. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to have the results within 24 hours, making the application of mNGS feasible for clinical diagnostics."

METHODS: Fifty-one penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from respiratory samples of infants and children hospitalized with lung infections. An antimicrobial susceptibility test was used to assess drug resistance. Polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to identify S. pneumoniae isolates and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to analyze molecular subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of PFGE fingerprints was used to compare genetic diversity and relatedness of S. pneumoniae isolates. The Quellung test was used for serotyping. RESULTS: Fifty-one penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae isolates showed evidence of multi-drug resistance and polyclonal origins. The isolates were classified into 25 subtypes through hierarchical cluster analysis of PFGE fingerprints. Three of these subtypes formed a supertype (15/51, 16/51 and 8/51 isolates), while the remaining subtypes occurred sporadically (12/51 isolates). CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae is mostly vertical and to a lesser extent horizontal. Effective prevention strategies, including respiratory tract management and contact isolation, are essential to control nosocomial S. pneumoniae infection. Once susceptibility is confirmed, vancomycin, high-dose penicillin or third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) may be used to treat penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae."

METHODS: We surveyed S. pneumoniae with conventional bacteriological techniques and with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and pleural fluid. S. pneumoniae strains were isolated from 33 different hospitals in Turkey, which are giving health services to approximately 60% of the Turkish population. RESULTS: A total of 167 cases were diagnosed with invasive pneumococcal disease between 2015 and 2018. We diagnosed 52 (31.1%) patients with meningitis, 104 (62.2%) patients with bacteremia, and 11 (6.6%) patients with empyema. Thirty-three percent of them were less than 2 years old and 56% less than 5 years old. Overall PCV13 serotypes accounted for 56.2% (94/167). The most common serotypes were 19 F (11.9%), 1 (10.7%) and 3 (10.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Besides the increasing frequency of non-vaccine serotypes, vaccine serotypes continue to be a problem for Turkey despite routine and high-rate vaccination with PCV13 and significant reduction reported for the incidence of IPD in young children. Since new candidate pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with more serotype antigens are being developed, continuing IPD surveillance is a significant source of information for decision-making processes on pneumococcal vaccination."

A rare complication is an infection of the subgaleal hematoma, which typically happens due to concomitant scalp lacerations. Escherichia coli is the most common causative pathogen in peripartum cases, and Staphylococcus aureus predominates in trauma cases. An even more rare complication is infection of the hematoma with intact overlying skin, the proposed mechanism of action of which is a hematogenous spread of the bacteria. In this case, we report a 4-month-old unimmunized girl who sustained a subgaleal hematoma after a falling incident that did not result in any scalp laceration. She presented 5 days later with fever, irritability, increased scalp swelling, skin erythema, and site tenderness. Her blood culture remained sterile, but the hematoma aspirate culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient had a recent upper respiratory tract infection that we suspected to be the primary source of infection. She responded well to antibiotic therapy and required no surgical intervention. Conclusion: Subgaleal hematoma infection should be suspected in a child who presents with increased hematoma swelling, irritability, fever, and local signs of infection. Early recognition and treatment with antibiotics can prevent further complications, such as abscess formation and skull osteomyelitis."

Pneumonia is highly prevalent in intensive care units (ICUs), with high associated mortality. Empirical treatment prioritizes breadth of coverage while awaiting laboratory diagnosis, often at the expense of antimicrobial stewardship. Microarrays use multiple parallel polymerase chain reactions to enable a rapid syndromic approach to laboratory diagnosis.Aim. To evaluate the clinical and laboratory implications of introducing a bespoke 22-pathogen TaqMan Array Card (TAC) for rapid pathogen detection in deep respiratory samples from adult ICUs.Methodology. TAC results from all ICU patients prospectively tested over a 9-month period at Cambridge's Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory were compared to those of corresponding conventional microbiological assays (culture-, PCR- or serology-based) in terms of result agreement and time-to-result availability. Clinical impact was assessed by retrospective review of medical records.Results. Seventy-one patients were included [45 (63 %) male, median age 59). Overall result agreement was 94 %, with TAC detecting more pathogens than conventional methods. TAC detected Streptococcus pneumoniae more readily than culture (7 vs 0 cases; P=0.02). TAC did not detect Aspergillus spp. in eight culture- or galactomannan-positive cases. The median turnaround time (1 day) was significantly shorter than that of bacterial/fungal culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR and galactomannan testing (each 3 days; P<0.001), atypical bacteria serology (13 days; P<0.001) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture (46 days; P<0.001). Earlier result availability prompted discontinuation of unnecessary antimicrobials in 15/71 (21 %) cases, but had no bearing on patient isolation/deisolation.Conclusion. TAC provided greater overall yield of pathogen detection and faster turnaround times, permitting earlier discontinuation of unnecessary antimicrobials."

TB and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), if mortality estimates are combined, would rank as the third most common cause of death globally. It is estimated that each year there are approximately 10 million new cases of TB that are associated with approximately 1.2 million deaths, and almost 450 million new episodes of LRTI (synonymous with CAP) with approximately 4 million associated deaths. Globally, Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP. However, although well documented, it is not widely appreciated that in several parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important cause of CAP, if not the most common organism isolated in such settings. Thus, CAP due to M. tuberculosis is not uncommon in some parts of the world with up to a third of cases being attributable to M. tuberculosis. Consequently, TB remains an important clinical entity in the intensive care unit in these settings. Despite its frequency and importance, there are very limited data about TB CAP.

The clinical evaluation of CAP among patients with cancers remains unknown. Patients and Methods: This retrospective hospital-based study on adult CAP was conducted in Tang Du Hospital, China, from September 2018 to August 2019. The demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between CAP patients with and without cancers. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with CAP patients with and without cancers. Results: Data from 149 CAP patients with cancers and 268 CAP patients without cancers were analyzed. Patients without cancers were more likely to show fever, cough and yellow sputum, higher level of neutrophil count than the cancer patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae 14.77% vs 9.33%, p = 0.093) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae 16.11% vs 11.57%, p = 0.189) were among the most commonly encountered pathogens in both the groups. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. pneumoniae 26.50% vs 11.41%, p < 0.001), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae 8.21% vs 1.34%, p = 0.003), and filamentous fungi (10.82% vs 4.7%, p = 0.033) were predominant in CAP patients without cancers. Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae 22.15% vs 14.18%, p = 0.038) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococci (MRS 23.49 vs 15.68, p = 0.049) were more prevalent for CAP cancer patients.

In patients without cancers, MRS, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were associated with central nervous system (CNS) disease, connective tissue disease, bronchiectasis, respectively. In addition, healthy adults were likely to be infected with M. pneumoniae showing fever. Conclusion: CAP patients with cancers had atypical clinical manifestations and showed no distinct increase in inflammatory markers. The predominant pathogens differed as well as similar between the CAP patients with and without cancers. Certain pathogens follow a seasonal pattern.

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:32631331TITLE:Gastrointestinal symptoms in invasive pneumococcal disease: a cohort study.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: The study aimed to assess whether gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms at admission are associated with increased short-term mortality in patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). METHODS: We included all patients with IPD at Aker University Hospital in Oslo, Norway, from 1993 to 2008. Clinical data were registered. Survival data were retrieved from official registries. We used Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curve to compare mortality within 28 days of admission in patients with and without GI symptoms. RESULTS: Four hundred sixteen patients were included. Of these, 108 patients (26%) presented with GI symptoms, and 47 patients (11%) with GI symptoms only. Patients with GI symptoms were younger (p < 0.001) and had less cardiovascular disease (p < 0.001), pulmonary disease (p = 0.048), and cancer (p = 0.035) and received appropriate antibiotic treatment later. After adjusting for risk factors, we found an increased hazard ratio of 2.28 (95% CI 1.31-3.97) in patients presenting with GI symptoms. In patients with GI symptoms only there was an increased hazard ratio of 2.24 (95% CI 1.20-4.19) in univariate analysis, which increased to 4.20 (95% CI 2.11-8.39) after multivariate adjustment. Fewer patients with GI symptoms only received antibiotics upon admission. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of IPD patients present with GI symptoms only or in combination with other symptoms. GI symptoms in IPD are associated with increased short-term mortality."

We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. METHODS: We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14-267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85 000 (4900-546 000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75 000 (4400-483 000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20-60 years) is 769 (148-2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14-307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0-10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3000 (182-21 000). INTERPRETATION: The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A 3-year prospective observational epidemiological case study of HCAP was conducted in seven Spanish hospitals. Microbiological and patient characteristics and outcomes were collected and classified by causative pathogen into 4 categories: ""S. pneumoniae"", ""MRSA"", ""Others"" and ""Unknown"". Patients were followed up 30 days after discharge. RESULTS: A total of 258 (84.6%) patients were enrolled (170 were men [65.9%]). Mean age was 72.4 years +- 15 years (95% CI [70.54-74.25]). The etiology of pneumonia was identified in 73 cases (28.3%): S. pneumoniae in 35 patients (13.6%), MRSA in 8 (3.1%), and other microorganisms in 30 patients (11.6%). Significant differences in rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p < 0.05), previous antibiotic treatment (p<0.05), other chronic respiratory diseases, inhaled corticosteroids (p <0.01), and lymphoma (p < 0.05) were observed among the four groups. Patients with MRSA pneumonia had received more previous antibiotic treatment (87.5%). Thirty-three (12.8%) patients died during hospitalisation; death in 27 (81.2%) was related to pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of HCAP was identified in only one quarter of patients, with S. pneumoniae being the most prevalent microorganism. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases more frequently presented HCAP due to MRSA than to S. pneumoniae. Death at hospital discharge was related in most cases to pneumonia."

Lung aspiration is the gold standard specimen for pneumonia diagnostics. We report findings from analyses of lung and pleural aspirates collected in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study. METHODS: The PERCH study enrolled children aged 1-59 months hospitalized with World Health Organization defined severe or very severe pneumonia in 7 countries in Africa and Asia. Percutaneous trans-thoracic lung (LA) and pleural fluid (PF) aspiration was performed on a sample of pneumonia cases with radiological consolidation and/or pleural fluid in 4 countries. Venous blood and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected from all cases. Multiplex quantitative PCR and routine microbiologic culture were applied to clinical specimens. RESULTS: Of 44 LAs performed within 3 days of admission on 622 eligible cases, 13 (30%) had a pathogen identified by either culture (5/44) or by PCR (11/29). A pathogen was identified in 12/14 (86%) PF specimens tested by either culture (9/14) or PCR (9/11). Bacterial pathogens were identified more frequently than viruses. All but one of the cases with a virus identified were co-infected with bacterial pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae (9/44 [20%]) and Staphylococcus aureus (7/14 [50%]) were the predominant pathogen identified in LA and PF, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial pathogens predominated in this selected subgroup of PERCH participants drawn from those with radiological consolidation or pleural fluid, with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus the leading pathogens identified."

We report the changes in cases and etiologies of pediatric parapneumonic effusion in a children's hospital before and after national PCV13 vaccination programs. METHODS: We screened medical records of children 0-18 years admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital with diagnoses of lobar pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion between 2008 and 2017. Patients with effusion analyses were included. Results of blood, pleural fluid, and respiratory specimens surveyed as standard care were analyzed. RESULTS: Diagnostic testing revealed at least a pathogen in 85% of 202 children with lobar pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion. After national PCV13 immunization, pneumococcal empyema decreased by 72% among 2- to 5-year olds. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the second most common etiology. There were marked differences in effusion characteristics, metabolic, and respiratory parameters between children infected with pneumococcus and M. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of the national PCV13 immunization programs on pneumococcal empyema was evident and remained substantial after 4 years in Taiwan. Continuous surveillance is important to monitor the emergence of other pathogens including non-PCV serotypes and M. pneumoniae."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We have analysed the data of the official reporting documentation provided by the State Institution ""Poltava Regional Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine"" and the chart of patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of influenza who were in inpatient treatment at the Poltava Regional Clinical Infectious Hospital (PRCIH) in 2016-2018 years. In more detail, we examined 95 patients with pneumonia, which complicated the course of the flu. There were 43 (45.26%) female patients, - 52 (54.74%) male patients, aged 18 to 80 years. RESULTS: Results: Studies have shown that despite a decrease in the incidence of influenza in recent years, the incidence of pneumonia, which complicated the course of the flu, remained consistently high (19.7% - 20.8%) with bacteriological isolation of S.pneumoniae (22.11%), S.aureus (13.68%), Haemophilus influenza (4.21%) and E.coli (3.16%). Severe course of pneumonia with bloody sputum, evident shortness of breath, bilateral lung damage, and need for oxygen support were significantly more frequently reported in patients with isolated S.pneumoniae and S.aureus. However, the severe course of the disease with the formation of abscesses in the lungs was observed only in the group S.aureus despite the relatively young age of such patients and significantly fewer risk factors for severe influenza and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The study showed a consistently high incidence of pneumonia, which complicated the flu and caused by S.pneumoniae, S.aureus, Haemophilus influenza and E.coli. Pneumonia caused by S.pneumoniae and S.aureus, were characterizedthe most severe course; however, a severe course with the formation of abscesses in the lung tissue was observed only in the group of S.aureus."

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to HV-KP is uncommon and details of its clinical and microbiological features are limited. We report the first case of CAP due to capsular genotype K2-ST86 HV-KP in Okinawa, Japan and review infections caused by the K2-ST86 strain. A 79-year-old woman presenting with fever and productive cough persisting for the past three days was admitted to hospital. Her vital signs indicated septic shock. Lung examination by auscultation revealed holo-crackle and lobar pneumonia in chest radiography, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was suspected. However, sputum and blood cultures revealed Gram-negative coccus identified as K. pneumoniae. Genetic analysis identified the isolated strain as the K2 serotype harboring rmpA, iutA, entB, and mrkD. Therefore, we identified the isolated strain as hypervirulent. The isolate belonged to ST86 as determined by multilocus sequence typing. The case was not complicated by predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy related to HV-KP infection; thus, this CAP-causing HV-KP strain may differ from the typical HV-KP strain that induces liver abscess. A literature review identified only nine cases with CAP due to HV-KP. In all cases, the disease mainly occurred in older males with diabetes mellitus, which makes the present case unusual, and had high rates of septic shock and death. No case, including ours, was complicated by metastatic infection, suggesting that CAP due to HV-KP poses little distant metastasis risk, even in patients with bloodstream infection. In our review, consistent with our case, K2-ST86 was the most common strain of HV-KP in patients with CAP. Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and microbiological features of HV-KP CAP, with a focus on the K2-ST86 strain. Physicians should always consider K. pneumoniae in cases of sepsis CAP with lobar pneumonia."

We aimed at describing adherence to these guidelines by GPs in the management of their asplenic patients in France between 2013 and 2016. METHOD: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study between January 2013 and December 2016 in three French hospitals: asplenic adults were identified and their GPs were questioned. A descriptive analysis was performed to identify the immunization coverage, type and length of antibiotic prophylaxis, number of infectious episodes, and education of patients. RESULTS: 103 patients were finally included in this study: only 57% were adequately vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis, 74% against Haemophilus influenzae type b, and 59% against influenza. Only 24% of patients received a combination of all four vaccinations. Two-thirds of patients received prophylactic antibiotics for at least 2 years. Overall, this study found that 50% of splenectomized patients experienced at least one pulmonary or otorhinolaryngological infection, or contracted influenza. CONCLUSIONS: These data match those reported in other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, meaning a still insufficient coverage of preventive measures in asplenic patients. Improved medical data sharing strategies between healthcare professionals, along with educational measures to keep patients and physicians up to date in the prevention of infections after splenectomy would improve health outcomes of asplenic patients."

It disseminates through colonizers and causes serious infections. Aims of this study are to determine pneumococcal carriage rate, resistance, serotype distribution, and coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines from children attending day care centers from Irbid and Madaba in Jordan. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from day care centers (DCCs) of healthy Jordanian children 2-4 years of age from four regions of Madaba (n = 596), and from eastern Irbid (n = 423). Swabs were cultivated on Columbia blood agar base supplemented with 5% sheep blood and incubated for 18-24 hours at 37 C with 5% CO2. Alpha-hemolytic isolates were tested for optochin sensitivity and bile solubility for identification. Isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility by the Vitek2 system and E-test (BioMerieux). Serotyping was performed using the Neufeld Quellung method. A total of 341 pneumococcal strains were isolated from 1019 nasopharyngeal (NP) samples of healthy children attending DCCs for two winter seasons from 2017-2019. Carriage rate in eastern Irbid for both seasons was 29.6% and for Madaba 37.9%. Resistance rates for Irbid and Madaba, respectively, were as follows: Penicillin (86.3%; 94.4%), erythromycin (57.0%; 78.2%), clindamycin (30.8%; 47.2%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (68.6%; 86.6%), and tetracycline (45.7%; 51.9%). Predominant serotypes for Irbid were 19F (20.8%), 23F (12.0%), 6A (10.4%), and 6B (9.6%); whereas for Madaba were 19F (24.5%), 14 (7.4%), 6A (6.9%) and 23F (6.5%). Serotype coverage of the thirteen valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was about 65% for both regions. Over 96% of isolates with PCV13 serotypes in this study were resistant to penicillin with the exception of serotypes 3 and 5. As a conclusion resistance and carriage rates among the age group 2 to 4 years reached an alarming rate especially among vaccine types, which can be controlled by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination strategies."

Community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia are characterized by high healthcare costs, morbidity and non-negligible rates of fatality. The overcoming prevalence of resistant gram-negative and positive bacteria (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin and ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases producing Enterobacteriaceae) has made the most of the first-line agents ineffective for treating lower respiratory tract infections. A broad-spectrum of activity, favourable pulmonary penetration, harmlessness and avoiding in some cases a combination therapy, characterise new cephalosporins such as ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftobiprole, ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftaroline. We aimed to summarise the role and place in therapy of new cephalosporins in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia within the setting of internal medicine wards. The ""universal pneumonia antibiotic strategy"" is no longer acceptable for treating lung infections. Antimicrobial therapy should be individualized considering local antimicrobial resistance and epidemiology, the stage of the illness and potential host factors predisposing to a high risk for specific pathogens."

Streptococcus pyogenes is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pleuropneumonia/empyema in children, but its relative incidence is rising. METHODS: The medical records of all children 0-18 years of age from 2004 to 2019, with discharge diagnoses of pleuropneumonia or empyema, and a positive blood and/or pleural effusion culture for group A streptococcus (GAS) (S. pyogenes), or S. pneumonia (SP) were reviewed. A comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics for the 2 etiologies was performed. RESULTS: Ninety cases of community-acquired pleuropneumonia/empyema caused by these organisms were included: 20 GAS and 70 SP. Compared with children with SP, those with GAS were more likely to have larger pleural effusion requiring drainage and longer hospitalization, and less likely to have a positive blood culture. The relative portion of GAS empyema increased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with SP empyema, GAS appears to cause more morbidity and a longer hospital stay. This organism is more frequently recovered from pleural fluid without bacteremia, and thus necessitates pleural fluid tap for accurate diagnosis."

Its colonization is thought to be the first step in the development of invasive pneumococcal diseases. This study aimed to investigate pneumococcal colonization patterns in early childhood. A longitudinal birth cohort study was conducted for investigating nasopharyngeal colonized pneumococci at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age, particularly focusing on the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) effect on nasopharyngeal colonization was also assessed. During 2013-2017, 855 infants were enrolled and a total of 107 isolates were recovered from 95 infants during the first three years of life. In this period, the prevalence of pneumococcal colonization increased, with values ranging from 0.2% (2/834) at 1 month of age to 5.9% (19/323) at 36 months of age. The investigation of serotype revealed that 81.1% (73/90) belonged to the non-PCV13 serotypes-23A, 15A, 15C, and 15B. Moreover, PCV13 serotypes significantly decreased during 2014-2015, when routine PCV13 vaccination was initiated in Taiwan. PCV13 introduction may lead to the reduction in the rates of pneumococcal isolates resistant (R) to penicillin. Under conditional PCV13 vaccination, pneumococcal isolates primarily belonged to non-PCV13 serotypes. This non-PCV13 serotype replacement exhibited lower rates of penicillin R isolates, suggesting that PCV13 administration may reduce the antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal disease burden and antibiotic use."

End-stage lung disease is the leading cause of death in people with CF, and lung transplant is required to preserve life. Anti-rejection medications are necessary post-transplant; however, these medications lower immune response and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections. Complications from infections post lung-transplant account for approximately 30% of CF-related deaths. Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is a rare deep neck infection that occurs most commonly in children. This is the case of a 45-year-old Caucasian male with CF who developed a retropharyngeal abscess post wisdom teeth extraction that seeded into hardware from a previous cervical disc fusion. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe neck and shoulder pain, limited range of motion in his arm and neck, and dysphonia. He reported feeling pain for 10 days and suspected the pain was caused by a weightlifting injury. The patient reported low-grade fever 5 days prior, which responded to acetaminophen. He was afebrile upon admission and in no respiratory distress. Diagnostic labs revealed WBC 22,000/uL and CRP 211 mg/L. The CT scan showed a large abscess in the retropharyngeal space between C2-C7. The immediate concern was airway obstruction and need for possible intubation or tracheostomy. The patient was transferred to ENT service with neurosurgery and transplant consults. The RPA was drained and lavaged. The cervical hardware was discovered to be infected and was removed. The source of the RPA infection was determined to be from the patient's wisdom teeth extraction 6 months prior to RPA. The patient received 8 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone for Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia and underwent revision of his cervical fusion 3 months after hardware removal. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for immunocompromised patients when they are at increased risk for transient bacteremia such as following invasive procedures (e.g., tooth extraction). Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy could prevent potentially life-threatening infections such as RPA in immunocompromised patients."

Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are the most important specimens obtained from patients with LRI. The choice of antibiotic with which to treat LRI usually depends on the antimicrobial sensitivity of bacteria isolated from sputum and BALF. However, differences in the antimicrobial sensitivity of pathogens isolated from sputum and BALF have not been evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the differences between sputum and BALF samples in terms of pathogen isolation and antimicrobial sensitivity in hospitalized patients with LRI. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, quality evaluation of sputum samples was not conducted before performing sputum culture; however, between 2016 and 2018, quality evaluation of sputum samples was conducted first, and only quality-assured samples were cultured. The numbers of sputum and BALF in 2013-2015 were 15,549 and 1671, while those in 2016-2018 were 12,055 and 3735, respectively. The results of pathogen culture showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were in the top ten pathogens isolated from sputum and BALF. An antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that the susceptibility of BALF isolates to most antibiotics was higher compared with the susceptibility of sputum isolates, especially after quality control of sputum samples (2016-2018). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that caution is needed in making therapeutic choices for patients with LRI when using antimicrobial sensitivity results from sputum isolates as opposed to BALF isolates."

We aimed to assess the rate of bacterial and viral co-infections, as well as to report the most common micro-organisms involved in patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this monocenter retrospective study, we reviewed all the respiratory microbiological investigations performed within the first 48 h of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2) admitted for acute respiratory failure. RESULTS: From March 13th to April 16th 2020, a total of 92 adult patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 40-bed ICU for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Among them, 26 (28%) were considered as co-infected with a pathogenic bacterium at ICU admission with no co-infection related to atypical bacteria or viruses. The distribution of the 32 bacteria isolated from culture and/or respiratory PCRs was as follows: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10/32, 31%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 7/32, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6/32, 19%), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 5/32, 16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2/32, 6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/32, 3%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1/32, 3%). Among the 24 pathogenic bacteria isolated from culture, 2 (8%) and 5 (21%) were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporin and to amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a 28% rate of bacterial co-infection at ICU admission of patients with severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia, mostly related to Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterobacteriaceae. In French patients with confirmed severe SARSCoV-2 pneumonia requiring ICU admission, our results encourage the systematic administration of an empiric antibiotic monotherapy with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, with a prompt de-escalation as soon as possible.

The aim of our study is to analyze the difference of serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) between viral LRTI and bacterial LRTI in children. Methods: This retrospective study included children with LRTI caused by a single pathogen from Yancheng Third People's Hospital, Yancheng, China, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019. Participants were divided into the younger group (1 year old <= age < 3 years old) and the older group (3 years old <= age < 5 years old) for subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 475 children with LRTI caused by common respiratory pathogens were identified. In the younger group as well as the older group, the serum level of beta2-MG in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly increased compared to that in the Mycoplasma pneumoniae group. Compared with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection group, the serum beta2-MG level of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and influenza B virus groups were significantly higher in children between 1 and 3 years old. Conclusions: The serum beta2-MG may distinguish viral infection from bacterial infection in children with LRTI."

METHODS: Children <18 years were eligible for inclusion if they had a respiratory infection and a positive PCR-based assay for respiratory viruses as well as a positive blood culture from 2010 to 2018 at a single referral centre in the United States regardless of their underlying medical condition or antibiotic treatment history. Monthly incidence rates of respiratory viruses and bacteraemia were analysed with a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) and cross-correlation functions using time series regression modelling. RESULTS: We identified 7,415 unique positive respiratory virus tests, including 2,278 RSV (31%), 1,825 influenza viruses (24%), 1,036 parainfluenza viruses (14%), 1,017 hMPV (14%), 677 seasonal coronaviruses (9%), and 582 adenoviruses (8%), and a total of 11,827 episodes of bacteraemia. Significant co-seasonality was found between all-cause bacteraemia and RSV (OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.50-2.06, P<0.001), influenza viruses (OR=1.38, 95% CI 1.13-1.68, P=0.002), and seasonal coronaviruses (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.09-1.28, P<0.001), respectively. Analysis of linked viral-bacterial infections in individual children indicated that the rate ratio (RR) of bacteraemia associated with hMPV (RR=2.73, 95% CI 1.12-6.85, P=0.019) and influenza (RR=2.61, 95% CI 1.21-6.11, P=0.013) were more than double that of RSV. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most commonly identified pathogens causing bacteraemia. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between hMPV and influenza viruses, and bacteraemia of all causes in hospitalised children at a single paediatric centre in the United States. Large multicentre studies are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the mechanisms by which hMPV potentiates the virulence and invasive capacity of diverse bacteria."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:32919518TITLE:Complicated pneumonia in children.ABSTRACT:Complicated community-acquired pneumonia in a previously well child is a severe illness characterised by combinations of local complications (eg, parapneumonic effusion, empyema, necrotising pneumonia, and lung abscess) and systemic complications (eg, bacteraemia, metastatic infection, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and, rarely, death). Complicated community-acquired pneumonia should be suspected in any child with pneumonia not responding to appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48-72 h. Common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients have initial imaging with chest radiography and ultrasound, which can also be used to assess the lung parenchyma, to identify pleural fluid; CT scanning is not usually indicated. Complicated pneumonia is treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, and then oral antibiotics. The initial choice of antibiotic is guided by local microbiological knowledge and by subsequent positive cultures and molecular testing, including on pleural fluid if a drainage procedure is done. Information from pleural space imaging and drainage should guide the decision on whether to administer intrapleural fibrinolytics. Most patients are treated by drainage and more extensive surgery is rarely needed; in any event, in low-income and middle-income countries, resources for extensive surgeries are scarce. The clinical course of complicated community-acquired pneumonia can be prolonged, especially when patients have necrotising pneumonia, but complete recovery is the usual outcome."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the bloodstream infections in patients with hematological diseases from January 2014 to December 2018 at the institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital; this included an assessment of the clinical characteristics, distribution of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance data. Results: There were 1935 episodes of BSIs in the 1478 patients who were studied; among these, 1700 episodes occurred in the neutropenic phase. The 7-day and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by respiratory tract, perianal zone mucositis, and digestive tract symptoms; the respective proportions were 12.4%, 12.3%, and 9.1%, respectively. Total 2025 strains were isolated; 1551 (76.6%) of the pathogens were gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 423 (20.9%) were gram-positive bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Viridans; 51 (2.5%) were fungi, mainly Candida tropicalis. The resistance rates of Enterobateriaceae to piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, amikacin were <10%. The resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem increased annually. The resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin/tazobactam, quinolones, Aminoglycosides were <5% even when compared to carbapenems. Eleven stains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 stain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were detected. Conclusion: The pathogens of bloodstream infection in adult patients with hematological diseases are widely distributed. The resistance rates of different strains vary; the rates in some species had a tendency to increase. Antibiotics should be selected rationally as per the distribution of pathogens and resistance to antibiotics in different patient groups."

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data, pathogen species distribution, and drug sensitivity data of bloodstream infection in neutropenic pediatric patients with hematological malignancies from the Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital from January 2014 to December 2018. Results: Total 537 episodes of bloodstream infections occurred in 427 neutropenic children with hematological malignancies; the 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 3.7%. The clinical feature of 44.7% patients with bloodstream infection was only fever, and the pathogenic bacteria were mainly enterobacteriaceae bacteria. Bloodstream infection was usually accompanied by oral mucosa (20.7%) , respiratory tract (20.5%) , and digestive tract (14.3%) symptoms. The distribution of pathogens in patients with different symptoms of bloodstream infection varied (chi(2)=40.561, P=0.001) .

Methods: Retrospective analysis was used to select sputum samples from 400 lung cancer patients after chemotherapy admitted in Fuyang People's Hospital from July 2017 to July 2019. Culture, isolation and identification of strains were conducted in accordance with the national clinical examination operating procedures. Results: A total of 134 strains were identified. In 120 patients with pulmonary infection, 114 strains were cultured. Twenty strains of klebsiella pneumoniae were cultured in 280 patients without pulmonary infection. Among the 134 strains, the detection rate of gram-negative bacteria was 79.10%. The first four strains were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. The gram-positive bacteria detection rate was 4.47%, mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus. The fungus detection rate was 16.42%. The drug sensitivity results showed that the resistance rate of gram-negative bacillus to penicillin and cephalosporin was higher, and were more sensitive to carbapenem, piperacillin tazobactam and cefoperazone sulbactam. Gram-positive cocci were resistant to penicillin, macrolide and clindamycin, and sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin and rifampicin. All strains of fungal culture were candida albicans, which were sensitive to common antifungal drugs. Among the 20 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae cultured in sputum specimens of non-infected patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy, 2 strains were integron-positive strains, and all of them were class I integrons. Conclusions: Lung cancer patients after chemotherapy have a high resistance to commonly used antimicrobial drugs, so it is necessary to detect the resistance of pathogenic microorganisms in clinical practice. The strains carried by patients with lung cancer without pulmonary infection during chemotherapy can isolate type I integrons, suggesting that the spread of drug resistance at gene level should be closely detected."

This study describes the evolution of resistance to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) in Hi isolates and characteristics of patients with Hi severe pneumonia. Methods: A monocentric retrospective observational study including patients from 2008 to 2017 with severe pneumonia hospitalized in ICU. Evolution of amoxicillin and AMC susceptibility was showed. Characteristics of patients with Hi pneumonia were compared to characteristics of patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) pneumonia, as reference. Risk factors for amoxicillin resistance in Hi were investigated. Results: Overall, 113 patients with Hi and 132 with Sp pneumonia were included. The percentages of AMC resistance among Hi strains decreased over the years (from 10% in 2008-2009 to 0% in 2016-2017) while resistance to amoxicillin remained stable at 20%. Also, percentages of Sp resistant strains for amoxicillin decreased over years (from 25% to 3%). Patients with Hi pneumonia experienced higher prevalence of bronchitis (18% vs. 8%, p=0.02, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (43% vs. 30% p=0.03), HAP (18% vs. 7%, p=0.01, ventilator-associated pneumonia (27% vs. 17%, p=0.04, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (8 days vs. 6 days, p=0.04) than patients with Sp pneumonia. Patients with Sp pneumonia had more frequently local complications than patients with Hi pneumonia (17% vs. 7%, p=0.03). De-escalation of antibiotics was more frequent in patients with Sp than in patients with Hi (67% vs. 53%, p=0.03). No risk factors were associated with amoxicillin resistance among patients with Hi pneumonia. Conclusions: Amoxicillin resistance was stable over time, but no risk factors were detected. AMC resistance was extremely low, suggesting that AMC could be used for empiric treatment of Hi pneumonia, as well as other molecules, namely, cephalosporins. Patients with Hi pneumonia had more pulmonary comorbidities and severe diseases than patients with Sp pneumonia."

We aimed to describe trends in all-cause pneumonia mortality and overall mortality, and in the incidence of all-cause pneumonia and otitis media (OM) in Colombian children <2 y (y = years) of age, before and after PCV introduction. We obtained mortality and incidence data, nationally and for five major cities (Bogota, Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali and Cartagena) from 2005-2016 and 2008-2016, respectively, comparing mortality and incidence proportions in the post-PCV introduction period with those in the pre-PCV period. Overall mean reductions in all-cause pneumonia mortality was observed in the post-PCV period nationally (48.8%; 95%CI: 45.5-51.8%) and in four cities including Bogota (77.1%; 71.1-81.8%) and Medellin (56.4%; 44.1-65.9%); no substantial reduction was observed in Cartagena. Similar findings were observed for overall mortality. Reductions in all-cause pneumonia incidence were observed in Bogota (66.0%; 65.5-66.6%), Medellin (40.6%; 39.3-41.9%) and Cartagena (15.0%; 11.2-18.6%), while incidence increased in Barranquilla (78.5%; 68.4-89.2%) and Cali (125.5%; 119.2-132.0%). All-cause OM incidence fell in Medellin and Bogota (42.1-51.1%) but increased (95.8%) in Barranquilla. In conclusion, overall reductions in disease outcomes were observed following PCV introduction in most cities and nationwide. Decreasing trends in outcomes were observed prior to PCV introduction, and limited data points and data reporting issues may have influenced our results. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02567747)."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:32968689TITLE:Normal Respiratory Flora as a Cause of Community-Acquired Pneumonia.ABSTRACT:Background: Intensive studies have failed to identify an etiologic agent in >50% cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Bacterial pneumonia follows aspiration of recognized bacterial pathogens (RBPs) such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus after they have colonize the nasopharynx. We hypothesized that aspiration of normal respiratory flora (NRF) might also cause CAP. Methods: We studied 120 patients hospitalized for CAP who provided a high-quality sputum specimen at, or soon after admission, using Gram stain, quantitative sputum culture, bacterial speciation by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, and viral polymerase chain reaction. Thresholds for diagnosis of bacterial infection were >=105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL sputum for RBPs and >=106 cfu for NRF. Results: Recognized bacterial pathogens were found in 68 of 120 (56.7%) patients; 14 (20.1%) of these had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Normal respiratory flora were found in 31 (25.8%) patients; 10 (32.2%) had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Infection by >=2 RBPs occurred in 10 cases and by NRF together with RBPs in 13 cases. Among NRF, organisms identified as Streptococcus mitis, which share many genetic features of S pneumoniae, predominated. A respiratory virus alone was found in 16 of 120 (13.3%) patients. Overall, an etiologic diagnosis was established in 95.8% of cases. Conclusions: Normal respiratory flora, with or without viral coinfection, appear to have caused one quarter of cases of CAP and may have played a contributory role in an additional 10.8% of cases caused by RBPs. An etiology for CAP was identified in >95% of patients who provided a high-quality sputum at, or soon after, the time of admission."

Pneumococcal colonization is considered a pre-requisite for disease. Identifying the serotypes circulating in a given locale is important for surveillance purposes as well as for assessing the need for vaccination. Aim of the present study was to identify nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization rates in healthy children and children with respiratory tract infections in central Sri Lanka. METHOD: A total of 450 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) of children aged between 2 months and 2 years were collected from two groups; healthy children and children hospitalized with respiratory symptoms. NPS samples were processed using conventional laboratory techniques to isolate S. pneumoniae. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pneumococcal isolates were identified using CLSI disc diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by micro-broth dilution method. RESULTS: Pneumococcal colonization rate among healthy children was 31.8% (143/450) it was 39.8% (179/450) in children hospitalized with respiratory symptoms. MIC for penicillin and cefotaxime ranged between 0.015 to 4 microg/ml and <0.015 to 16 microg/ml respectively. All isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin, vancomycin, linezolid and rifampicin. Erythromycin and tetracycline non-susceptibility rates were >50% in both groups. The predominant serotypes identified were 19F (n = 66, 20.5%), 6B (n = 43, 13.4%), 6A (n = 30, 9.3%), 23F (n = 28, 8.7%) and 14 (n = 20, 6.2%). Among healthy children, presence of school going children at home and the number of household members were significantly associated with pneumococcal colonization while in hospitalized children, pneumococcal colonization was significantly associated with presence of school going children at home. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal colonization rates were considerably higher in both study cohorts and the commonest serotypes were 19F, 6B, 6A, 23F and 14. Antibiotic resistance rates were also relatively higher among the pneumococcal isolates."

The aim of this study is to analyse the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics associated with IPD that may require admission to the PICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on cases of IPD diagnosed in three Paediatric Hospitals in Barcelona between January 2012 and June 2016. An analysis was made of the associations between the admission to PICU and the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological variables. RESULTS: A total of 263 cases with IPD were included, of which 19% (n = 50) required admission to PICU. Patients with septic shock (7; 100%), meningitis (16; 84.2%), and those with complicated pneumonia (23; 15.2%) were admitted to the PICU. The most frequent complications were pulmonary (35.2%) and neurological (39.5%). The ratio between admission and non-admission to PICU was 4.7 times higher in subjects with an underlying disease. The serotypes associated with PICU admission were 19A (23% of the total of this serotype), serotype 14 (20%), serotype 3 (17%), and serotype 1 (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: IPD required PICU admission in cases of septic shock and meningitis, and less so with complicated pneumonia. The percentage of admissions is greater in children with an underlying disease. Admission into the PICU involves a longer stay, complications during the acute phase, as well as sequelae, particularly neurological ones.

In the third world countries, information about CAP etiology is scarce. Therefore, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic methods are crucial to determine etiological agents. METHODS: Between March 2016 and March 2017, we have prospectively studied the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular aspects of patients with CAP at 2 tertiary-level hospitals in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 274 children were evaluated, with a median age of 13 months. An etiologic agent was identified in 187 patients (68.2%): 54% (n = 148) were viruses and 14.2% (n = 39) were bacteria. CAP prevalence was highest among children under 2 years (71%; 195/274); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent cause in 22% (60/274), especially among infants, followed by influenza (14.5%; 40/274). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 7% of the total (19/274), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3%;8/274) and Haemophilus influenzae (1.4%;4/274). Together, these cases accounted for 79.5% (31/39) of all bacterial CAP. Pleural effusion (PE) complicated CAP in 13.8% (38/274), of which 29 were of bacterial etiology. RT-PCR increased the detection rate of pneumococcus by 47%. Coinfection occurred in 28 patients (10%); 26 (9.5%) required intensive care and 9 patients (3%) died. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR provided additional diagnostic value to conventional, clinical, and laboratory methods. The higher prevalence of RSV, influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the need for preventive measures with better vaccine uptake and future research for RSV vaccines."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pneumoniaeID:33024653TITLE:Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a systematic review.ABSTRACT:Background: The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved since the beginning of the antibiotic era. Recent guidelines encourage immediate empiric antibiotic treatment once a diagnosis of CAP is made. Concerns about treatment recommendations, on the one hand, and antibiotic stewardship, on the other, motivated this review of the medical literature on the etiology of CAP. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature on the etiology of CAP using methods defined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed using a combination of the keywords 'pneumonia', 'CAP', 'etiology', 'microbiology', 'bacteriology', and 'pathogen'. We examined articles on antibiotics that were develop to treat pneumonia. We reviewed all 'related articles' as well as studies referenced by those that came up in the search. After we excluded articles that did not give sufficient microbiological data or failed to meet other predetermined criteria, 146 studies remained. Data were stratified into diagnostic categories according to the microbiologic studies that were done; results are presented as the percentage in each category of all cases in which an etiology was established. Results: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP although declining in incidence; this decline has been greater in the US than elsewhere. Haemophilus influenzae is the second most common cause of CAP, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli. The incidence of all bacteria as causes of CAP has declined because, with routine use of PCR for viruses, the denominator, cases with an established etiology, has increased. Viruses were reported on average in about 10% of cases, but recent PCR-based studies identified a respiratory virus in about 30% of cases of CAP, with substantial rates of viral/bacterial coinfection. Conclusion: The results of this study justify current guidelines for initial empiric treatment of CAP. With pneumococcus and Haemophilus continuing to predominate, efforts at antibiotic stewardship might be enhanced by greater attention to the routine use of sputum Gram stain and culture. Because viral/bacterial coinfection is relatively common, the identification of a virus by PCR does not, by itself, allow for discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy."

The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of etiological agents and their relationship with clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in this cohort of patients with CABM. METHODS: Our retrospective chart review analyzed the causative microorganisms, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes of 159 adults with CABM hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Centre of Vilnius University Hospital from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. A Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score <= 3 was defined as unfavorable outcome. Predictors of an unfavorable outcome were identified through logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median patient age was 36 (IQR 24-56), and 51.6% were male. Microbiologically confirmed causative agents were identified in 80 (50.3%) patients: N. meningitidis in 55 (34.6%) patients with serotype B accounting for 85% of cases, S. pneumoniae in 15 (9.4%), L. monocytogenes in 5 (3.1%) and other in 5 (3.1%). The clinical triad of fever, neck stiffness and a change in mental status was present in 59.1% of patients. Coexisting conditions and comorbidities were similar in all groups stratified by etiology. Initial antimicrobial treatment consisted of penicillin in 78 patients (49.1%) and ceftriaxone in 72 patients (45.3%). The median time in which antibiotic treatment was started was 40 min (IQR 30.0-90.0). The outcome was unfavorable in 15.7% of episodes and death occurred in 5.7% of cases and did not differ according to the causative agent. Risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were age > 65 years, coexisting pneumonia and a platelet count <150x10e9/l. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative agent of CABM was N. meningitidis, with serotype B clearly dominant. Causative agents did not influence the disease outcome. The strongest risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were older age, pneumonia and a low platelet count. Since the introduction of routine vaccination against meningococcus B for infants in Lithuania in 2018, the national vaccination policy may hopefully contribute to a decrease in the incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease in the Lithuanian population."

METHODS: Clinical information and chest CT data of 149 COVID-19 patients between January 9, 2020 and March 15, 2020 and 97 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia between January 23, 2011 and March 18, 2020 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively analyzed. In addition, CT features were comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: According to the chest CT images, the probability of lung segmental and lobar pneumonia in S. pneumoniae pneumonia was higher than that in COVID-19(P<0.001); the probabilities of ground-glass opacity (GGO), the ""crazy paving"" sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa in COVID-19 were higher than those in S. pneumoniae pneumonia(P = 0.005, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively); and the probabilities of consolidation lesions, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, and pleural effusion in S. pneumoniae pneumonia were higher than those in COVID-19 (P<0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.003, P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of GGO, the crazy paving sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa on chest CT were significantly higher in COVID-19 than S. pneumoniae pneumonia. The most important differential points on chest CT signs between COVID-19 and S. pneumoniae pneumonia were whether disease lesions were distributed in entire lung lobes and segments and whether the crazy paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidation lesions were found."

METHODS: We used the IBM  MarketScan  Research Databases to identify adult outpatients with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes during 2016-2017 for blastomycosis; coccidioidomycosis; histoplasmosis; pneumonia (viral, bacterial, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and unspecified pneumonia); influenza; tuberculosis; and other lower and upper respiratory infections. We compared symptoms on and in the 90 days before diagnosis between patients with these diagnosis codes. RESULTS: Fever was less common in blastomycosis (2.6%), histoplasmosis (5.3%) and coccidioidomycosis (9.4%) than in influenza (18.5%) or pneumonia (12.6%-16.3%) patients. Fungal diseases resembled bacterial, viral, and unspecified pneumonias for many pulmonary symptoms. However, cough was more common with coccidioidomycosis (31.4%) and less common with histoplasmosis (14.0%) and blastomycosis (13.1%) vs. influenza (20.2%). Although less frequent, solitary pulmonary nodule (5.2%-14.4%), enlarged lymph nodes (3.7%-9.0%), hyperhidrosis (<2%), and erythema nodosum (<2%) were particularly suggestive of fungal diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations inherent in administrative coding, this analysis of symptom codes across disease types suggests that fungal diseases may be difficult to clinically distinguish from other causes of pneumonia except when certain uncommon symptoms are present. Healthcare providers caring for patients with pneumonia, especially if non-responsive to conventional treatment, should consider fungal diseases as possible etiologies."

We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with underlying human immunodeficiency virus who presented with fever and altered mental status. Subsequent workup supported a diagnosis of Austrian syndrome. During the 5-week course of ceftriaxone treatment, she developed fever, pruritus and follicular accentuation throughout the body. Labs were significant for eosinophilia, which along with systemic symptoms, supported the diagnosis of a drug reaction. Coagulase negative staphylococcus bacteremia was discovered when the patient developed septic shock. Subsequently, diffuse desquamative eruption with rapidly progressing sloughing appeared and biopsy proved toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patient eventually succumbed to multiorgan failure."

We studied potential etiologies of SARI among adults in six countries using multi-pathogen diagnostics. METHODS: We enrolled both adults with SARI (acute respiratory illness onset with fever and cough requiring hospitalization) and asymptomatic adults (adults hospitalized with non-infectious illnesses, non-household members accompanying SARI patients, adults enrolled from outpatient departments, and community members) in each country. Demographics, clinical data, and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected from both SARI patients and asymptomatic adults. Specimens were tested for presence of 29 pathogens utilizing the Taqman  Array Card platform. We applied a non-parametric Bayesian regression extension of a partially latent class model approach to estimate proportions of SARI caused by specific pathogens. RESULTS: We enrolled 2,388 SARI patients and 1,135 asymptomatic adults from October 2013 through October 2015. We detected >=1 pathogen in 76% of SARI patients and 67% of asymptomatic adults. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were most commonly detected (>=23% of SARI patients and asymptomatic adults). Through modeling, etiology was attributed to a pathogen in most SARI patients (range among countries: 57.3-93.2%); pathogens commonly attributed to SARI etiology included influenza A (14.4-54.4%), influenza B (1.9-19.1%), rhino/enterovirus (1.8-42.6%), and RSV (3.6-14.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of multi-pathogen diagnostics and modeling enabled attribution of etiology in most adult SARI patients, despite frequent detection of multiple pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. Seasonal flu vaccination and development of RSV vaccine would likely reduce the burden of SARI in these populations."

This article reports the first WGS data on S. pneumoniae isolates in the Czech Republic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five isolates of S. pneumoniae from IPD recovered in 2017-2019 were selected for WGS. These were serotypes 4, 8, 9V, 19A, and 22F, which were determined by the Quellung reaction in combination with endpoint multiplex PCR (mPCR). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is routinely used for more detailed analysis termed sequence typing. The selected isolates were analysed by WGS on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The sequences obtained were processed using the Velvet de novo Assembler software. The assembled genomes were uploaded into the PubMLST database, using the BIGSdb platform, and then scanned automatically and molecularly characterized. The isolates were compared at three resolution levels: seven MLST genes, 53 ribosomal genes (rMLST), and 1420 genes (all loci). The all loci scheme covers MLST genes, ribosomal genes, and core genome MLST genes (cgMLST). These are all currently defined genes of S. pneumoniae available in the PubMLST database. Distance matrices based on the number and variability of all loci analysed were generated automatically using the Genome Comparator tool. Phylogenetic networks were created and edited with the SplitsTree4 package, using the NeighborNet algorithm. The final graphics were edited with the Inkscape software. RESULTS: Based on an overall view of the phylogenetic networks, it can be concluded that the genetic lines within each of S. pneumoniae serotypes 4, 8, 9V, 19A, and 22F are highly unrelated, to the same extent as if the isolates were of different serotypes. S. pneumoniae isolates of the same serotype, whether or not of the same sequence type, can be described, based on the results, as a non-homogeneous group with a number of unrelated genetic clusters that share genes assigning them to a specific serotype. WGS has also shown its discriminatory power, allowing the assignment of isolates of the same serotype and sequence type to different genetic clusters. CONCLUSION: Of the methods used so far in the Czech Republic, WGS allows the most detailed characterization of S. pneumoniae isolates. It is highly desirable to integrate it in the molecular surveillance of IPD in the Czech Republic, similarly to other countries in Europe and in the world."

Although co-infections have been previously reported, the co-existence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila is exceedingly rare. Despite the fact that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common etiology in the majority of cases, atypical organisms such as Legionella pneumophila should be considered as etiologic agents among all CAP cases that require hospitalization. Unlike Legionella, extra-pulmonary findings are uncommon in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. In this report, the authors describe an unusual case of septic shock resulting from a combined Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection associated with rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and acute liver injury."

METHODS: For the 2012-2016 ATLAS program, 205 medical centers located in Africa-Middle East (n = 12), Asia-Pacific (n = 32), Europe (n = 94), Latin America (n = 26), North America (n = 31), and Oceania (n = 10) consecutively collected the clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and in vitro susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were assessed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2019and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2019 guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, 176,345 isolates were collected from around the globe and included in the analysis. Regarding Gram-negative bacteria, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high susceptibility (> 90%) against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with increased antimicrobial activity observed from the addition of avibactam (4 mg/L) to ceftazidime. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, ceftaroline showed > 90% susceptibility against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. The antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were mostly stable from 2012 to 2016, but the susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumonia (88.4-81.6%) and to CR-P. aeruginosa (89.6-72.7%) decreased over time. In terms of regional difference, the susceptibilities of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to ceftaroline in Asia and of CR-K. pneumonia to ceftazidime-avibactam in Asia/Africa-Middle East were lower compared with other regions, while the susceptibility of CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam in North America was higher. CONCLUSION: The addition of avibactam improves the activity of ceftazidime against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The global antimicrobial susceptibilities to ceftaroline and ceftazidime-avibactam were, in general, stable from 2012 to 2016, but a marked reduction in the susceptibilities of specific species and CR-P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime-avibactam was observed."

Methods: We studied two sampling sets (Set 1 and Set 2). Set 1 consisted of results of testing 3382 assays of out-patients and hospital patients (5-88 years old) with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia of yet undetermined aetiology. Set 2 contained results of 1204 assays of hospital patients (12-94 years old) with pneumonia and COVID-19 already diagnosed by molecular biological techniques in test laboratories. The results were collected in twelve Russian cities/provinces in time range 2 March - 5 May 2020. Assays were analysed for 10 bacterial, 15 viral, 2 fungal and 2 parasitic aetiological agents. Results: In Set 1, 4.35% of total pneumonia cases were related to SARS-CoV-2, with substantially larger proportion (18.75%) of deaths of pneumonia with COVID-19 diagnosed. However, studying Set 2, we revealed that 52.82% patients in it were also positive for different typical and atypical aetiological agents usually causing pneumonia. 433 COVID-19 patients (35.96%) were tested positive for various bacterial aetiological agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infections accounting for the majority of secondary pneumonia cases. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a COVID-19 patient as a complication. An essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Russia in March-May 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. The problem of hospital-acquired bacterial infection is exceptionally urgent in treating SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia and its further complications, should be given very serious attention in combating SARS-CoV-2."

These are also commonly found in both healthy and sick children. In this study, we describe the first data on the most frequent bacteria and viruses detected in the nasopharynx of children from the general population in the Eastern DR Congo. METHODS: From January 2014 to June 2015, nasopharyngeal samples from 375 children aged from 2 to 60 months attending health centres for immunisation or growth monitoring were included in the study. Multiplex real-time PCR assays were used for detection of 15 different viruses and 5 bacterial species and for determination of pneumococcal serotypes/serogroups in the nasopharyngeal secretions. RESULTS: High levels of S. pneumoniae were detected in 77% of cases, and H. influenzae in 51%. Rhinovirus and enterovirus were the most commonly found viruses, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was rare (1%). Co-occurrence of both bacteria and viruses at high levels was detected in 33% of the children. The pneumococcal load was higher in those children who lived in a dwelling with an indoor kitchen area with an open fire, i.e. a kitchen with an open fire for cooking located inside the dwelling with the resultant smoke passing to the living room and/or bedrooms; this was also higher in children from rural areas as compared to children from urban areas or children not living in a dwelling with an indoor kitchen area with an open fire/not living in this type of dwelling. Immunization with 2-3 doses of PCV13 was associated with lower rates of pneumococcal detection. Half of the identified serotypes were non-PCV13 serotypes. The most common non-PCV13 serotypes/serogroups were 15BC, 10A, and 12F, while 5, 6, and 19F were the most prevalent PCV13 serotypes/serogroups. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of respiratory pathogens including S. pneumoniae in Congolese children was high but relatively few children had RSV. Non-PCV13 serotypes/serogroups became predominant soon after PCV13 was introduced in DR Congo."

Here, we investigated the effects of influenza-like illness (ILI) on pneumococcal carriage in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We investigated the presence of pneumococcal DNA in saliva samples collected in the 2014/2015 influenza season from 232 individuals aged >=60 years at ILI-onset, followed by sampling 2-3 weeks and 7-9 weeks after the first sample. We also sampled 194 age-matched controls twice 2-3 weeks apart. Pneumococcal DNA was detected with quantitative-PCRs targeting piaB and lytA genes in raw and in culture-enriched saliva. Bacterial and pneumococcal abundances were determined in raw saliva with 16S and piaB quantification. RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumococcus-positive samples was highest at onset of ILI (18% or 42/232) and lowest among controls (13% or 26/194, and 11% or 22/194, at the first and second sampling moment, respectively), though these differences were not significant. Pneumococcal carriage was associated with exposure to young children (OR:2.71, 95%CI 1.51-5.02, p<0.001), and among asymptomatic controls with presence of rhinovirus infection (OR:4.23; 95%CI 1.16-14.22, p<0.05). When compared with carriers among controls, pneumococcal absolute abundances were significantly higher at onset of ILI (p<0.01), and remained elevated beyond recovery from ILI (p<0.05). Finally, pneumococcal abundances were highest in carriage events newly-detected after ILI-onset (estimated geometric mean 1.21E -5, 95%CI 2.48E -7-2.41E -5, compared with pre-existing carriage). CONCLUSIONS: ILI exacerbates pneumococcal colonization of the airways in older adults, and this effect persists beyond recovery from ILI."

This might be related to the emergence of non-vaccine S. pneumoniae serotypes after PCV7 introduction although it is suggested that evolutionary factors may have modified the virulence and the interactions of pneumococci. The aim of this study was to clinically and microbiologically define NP in the population served by the three major paediatric hospitals in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in patients <18 years hospitalized due to invasive pneumococcal disease (January 2012-June 2016). Data of confirmed cases of pneumococcal NP (diagnosed by culture or DNA detection and serotyped) were collected. PCV13 was not systematically administered in Catalonia during the study period, but was available in the private market so the vaccination coverage in children increased from 48.2% to 74.5%. RESULTS: 35 cases of NP were identified. 77.1% of cases were associated with empyema. In the first 4 years, a trend to a decrease in NP incidence was observed (p=0.021), especially in children <5 years (p=0.006). Serotype 3 was responsible for 48.6% of NP cases. Five patients with NP due to serotype 3 were fully vaccinated for their age with PCV13. CONCLUSIONS: Serotype 3 has a preeminent role in pneumococcal NP and was associated with all PCV13 vaccination failures. Although in our series the incidence does not seem to be increasing, evolution of pneumococcal NP rates should be monitored after inclusion of PCV13 in the systematic calendar."

Pneumococcal vaccine shows clinical benefit and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) has been introduced in a routine immunization program in Japan. However, uptake of PPSV23 remains low, at 40%. One opportunity for capturing unvaccinated subjects is hospital referrals. Identifying factors associated with pneumococcal vaccination among referred subjects is thus important so that pulmonologists can maximize the capture of unvaccinated subjects. We retrospectively reviewed the records of subjects with a first referral to the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hiratsuka City Hospital from September 2017 to March 2018. Subjects who were >=65 years old and lived in Hiratsuka were included in this study. We compared the backgrounds of subjects and investigated factors associated with pneumococcal vaccination. A total of 142 individuals were included in this study and the pneumococcal vaccination rate was 44.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 36.0-52.9%). Of these, 127 subjects regularly visited clinics and/or hospitals for any diseases and their pneumococcal vaccine rate was 44.1% (95%CI, 35.3-53.2%). In multivariate analysis, chronic respiratory diseases (odds ratio 5.7; 95%CI, 2.2-14.9, P<0.001) and receipt of PPSV23 notification (odds ratio 8.5; 95%CI, 2.5-29.0, P<0.001) were positively associated with pneumococcal vaccination. In conclusion, chronic respiratory diseases and receipt of PPSV23 notification were positively associated with pneumococcal vaccination. However, pneumococcal vaccination rates remain relatively low, even in subjects regularly visiting clinics and/or hospitals."

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, in order to assess whether pneumococcal co-infection is associated with different mortality rate and hospital stay in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts, protocols, mortality, and hospitalization data of a consecutive series of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in northern Italy during COVID-19 outbreak were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing to detect an underlying pneumococcal co-infection. Covid19+/u-Ag+ and Covid19+/u-Ag- patients were compared in terms of overall survival and length of hospital stay using chi-square test and survival analysis. RESULTS: Out of 575 patients with documented pneumonia, 13% screened positive for the u-Ag test. All u-Ag+ patients underwent treatment with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin or Levofloxacin. Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Darunavir/Cobicistat were added in 44 patients, and hydroxychloroquine and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in 47 and 33 patients, respectively. All u-Ag+ patients were hospitalized. Mortality was 15.4% and 25.9% in u-Ag+ and u-Ag- patients, respectively (p = 0.09). Survival analysis showed a better prognosis, albeit not significant, in u-Ag+ patients. Median hospital stay did not differ among groups (10 vs. 9 days, p = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing helped to better target antibiotic therapy with a final trend of reduction in mortality of u-Ag+ COVID-19 patients having a concomitant pneumococcal infection. Randomized trials on larger cohorts are necessary in order to draw definitive conclusion."

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in the childhood immunization programme in 2013 but the serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are unknown. We did a cross-sectional nasopharyngeal carriage study in Luanda and Saurimo, Angola (PCV13 3rd dose coverage 67% and 84%, respectively) during November to December 2017 comprising 940 children aged 4-12 years. The main objective was to assess vaccine serotype coverage and antimicrobial susceptibility rates for S. pneumoniae. Our secondary aim was to characterize colonizinig strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pneumococcal colonization was found in 35% (95% CI 32-39%) of children (n = 332), with 41% of serotypes covered by PCV13. The most common serotypes were 3 (8%), 18C (6%), 23F (6%), 11A (6%), 34 (6%), 19F (5%) and 16 (5%). Carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was detected in 13% (95% CI 11-15%) and 15% (95% CI 13-17%) of children, respectively. Non-susceptibility to penicillin was common among pneumococci (40%), particularly among PCV13-included serotypes (50% vs. 33%; p = 0.003), although the median minimal inhibitory concentration was low (0.19 microg/mL, IQR 0.13-0.25 microg/mL). Most pneumococci and H. influenzae were susceptible to amoxicillin (99% and 88%, respectively). Furthermore, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was>70% among all three species. Multidrug-resistant pneumococci (non-susceptible to >= 3 antibiotics; 7% [n = 24]) were further studied with whole genome sequencing to investigate clonality as an underlying cause for this phenotype. No clearly dominating clone(s) were, however, detected. The results indicate that continued use of PCV13 may have positive direct and herd effects on pneumococcal infections in Angola as carriage of vaccine serotypes was common in the non-vaccinated age group. Finally, amoxicillin is assessed to be a feasible empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections in Angola."

METHODS: This was an observational study of prospectively collected data of consecutive adults with CAP and a definitive etiology enrolled between 2004 and 2018. Patients were divided into MSSA CAP and pneumococcal CAP groups for analysis. RESULTS: A microbial etiology was established in 1,548 (33%) cases: S. aureus caused 6% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases. In the latter, 52 were due to MSSA (60% of S. aureus CAP cases, and 3% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases) and 34 were due to MRSA (40% of S. aureus CAP cases, and 2% of microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases). S. pneumoniae was identified in 734 (47%) microbiologically-confirmed CAP cases. The presence of fever was independently associated with a lower risk of MSSA CAP (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.99). Patients with MSSA CAP had higher 30-day mortality than patients with pneumococcal CAP, both before and after adjustment for potential confounders (21% vs 7%, p=0.002). MSSA was independently associated with 30-day mortality in the overall population. CONCLUSION: MSSA CAP was associated with worse outcomes than pneumococcal CAP in our cohort.

To maximize the utility of UAT, it is necessary to investigate the patient factors affecting UAT results. However, there is no report elucidating the association between its utility and pre-existing lung abnormalities. We retrospectively reviewed 388 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia confirmed by blood and/or sputum culture tests. Finally, 94 of 388 patients who had the results of UAT and computed tomography scans were enrolled to evaluate the association between the utility of UAT and patient factors including pulmonary emphysema and fibrosis. The overall positive rate of UAT was 69.1%. The positive rates of UAT in the patients with emphysema were significantly lower than those in individuals without emphysema (33.3% and 77.6%, p < 0.001). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of emphysema was associated with a low positive rate (odds ratio 6.944, 95% confidence interval 2.268-21.231). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the presence of emphysema and lower levels of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly and independently associated with a low positive rate. The combination of emphysema and BUN can potentially stratify the positive rate of UAT in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and emphysema have a lower positive rate of UAT. Additionally, the combination of emphysema and serum BUN value may be useful to evaluate the reliability of the negative results of pneumococcal UAT."

METHODS: From September 2015 to August 2017, a prospective cohort study was conducted for adults aged >=19 years with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at four university hospitals. All-cause and pneumococcal CAP incidence and mortality rates were evaluated on the basis of hospital catchment population. Serotype distribution of pneumococcal CAP was also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 2669 patients with CAP, 252 cases (9.4%) were pneumococcal CAP cases. The annual incidences of all-cause and pneumococcal CAP were 194.3 cases and 18.3 cases respectively, per 100,000 persons. Serotyped Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 107 cases (42.5%) through culture or a serotype-specific urinary antigen detection assay. Pneumococcal CAP caused by the PCV13 and PPSV23 serotypes were 50 cases (46.7% of serotyped pneumococcal CAP and 19.8% of pneumococcal CAP), and 83 cases (77.6% of serotyped pneumococcal CAP and 32.9% of pneumococcal CAP), respectively. The most prevalent serotype was 3 (n = 21, 19.6% of serotyped pneumococcal CAP), followed by 19A (n = 10, 9.3% of serotyped pneumococcal CAP) and 11A (n = 10, 9.3% of serotyped pneumococcal CAP). Compared with non-pneumococcal CAP patients, pneumococcal CAP patients were more likely to have a higher CURB-65 scores (P = 0.002). The overall 30-day mortality rate of pneumococcal CAP was higher than that of non-pneumococcal CAP (6.3% versus 5.6%; odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-1.96), but this trend was reversed in patients aged 65-74 years (4.2% versus 8.6%; OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.14-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of PCV13-serotype pneumococcal CAP remains significantly high in Korean adults, particularly among elderly people, even after a high uptake of pediatric PCVs."

The serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae is essential information used to evaluate the value of pneumococcal vaccines and formulate immunization strategies. METHODS: Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, identified as the disease pathogens, were collected from children hospitalized in Beijing Children's Hospital from 2013 to 2019. The serotype was detected by the Quellung reaction. RESULTS: A total of 903 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were collected, among which 809 were from non-invasive infections and 94 were from invasive infections. The non-invasive isolates were mainly isolated from respiratory secretions (49.4%) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (38.9%), while invasive isolates were from venous blood (5.4%), cerebrospinal fluid (2.8%) and pleural effusion (2.8%). The leading serotypes were 19F (36.0%), 19A (13.6%), 23F (9.4%), 14 (8.9%), 6A (6.9%), and 6B (5.3%). The overall coverage rates of 10-, 13-, 15-, 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10, PCV13, PCV15, PCV20) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) as well as Pneumosil (a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) were 61.6%, 83.2%, 83.4%, 88.0%, 82.4% and 81.6%, respectively. The coverage rates of PCV13, PCV15 and PPV23 in isolates from invasive infections were significantly higher than those from non-invasive infections. The coverage rates of Pneumosil, either on the whole or among different age groups or different infections, were significantly higher than those of PCV10. CONCLUSIONS: Serotypes 19F, 19A, 23F, 14, 6A and 6B were the most common types among the isolates. As for pneumococcal vaccines available now, the coverage rate of PCV13 was high, especially in isolates from invasive infections. The promotion of PCV13 or further high valent vaccines might be of greater benefit in preventing pneumococcal infections than other pneumococcal vaccines in children."

There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines, one with polysaccharides from the capsule of 23 serotypes (PPSV23) and one with polysaccharides from 13 serotypes that have been conjugated to a protein (PCV13). Both vaccines decrease the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease and are recommended for all people >=65 years of age. We found the vaccination rate against S. pneumoniae in patients >=65 years of age in our resident physician continuity clinics was 59.85%, which is considerably lower than the vaccination rate of 69.16% in our attending physician clinics. The aim of our study was to double the number of vaccinations given in the resident physician clinics over a 1-month period without compromising workflow or unduly burdening the rooming nurse or resident physicians. For our primary intervention, we assigned a designated nurse with expertise in vaccinations the task of reviewing charts ahead of clinic visits then pending the order for the appropriate pneumococcal vaccine. Our secondary intervention was the education of physicians through pocket cards, verbal encouragement and email reminders. chi2 test was conducted to compare the proportion of patients 65 years or older who were vaccinated between the intervention and control groups. The results indicated that the intervention group patients were 2.61 times (95% CI 1.18 to 6.10) more likely to be vaccinated compared with the control group patients (20% vs 8.7%, chi2 (1)=5.16, p=0.02, Cramer's V=0.16). The intervention resulted in more than doubling the number of vaccinations in the intervention group compared with the control group. Moreover, poststudy interviews and surveys indicated our workflow is sustainable and amendable to wider use within the resident physician clinics."

Since S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP globally, it is important to distinguish between MC-CAP and CAP due to S. pneumoniae (SP-CAP) in clinical practice. However, no past study compared clinical characteristics of MC-CAP and SP-CAP by statistical analysis. We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of MC-CAP by comparing those of SP-CAP, as well as the utility of sputum Gram staining. METHODS: This retrospective study screened CAP patients aged over 20 years visiting or admitted to Okinawa Miyako Hospital between May 2013 and April 2018. Among these, we included patients whom either M. catarrhalis alone or S. pneumoniae alone was isolated from their sputum by bacterial cultures. RESULTS: We identified 134 MC-CAP and 130 SP-CAP patients. Although seasonality was not observed in SP-CAP, almost half of MC-CAP patients were admitted in the winter. Compared to those with SP-CAP, MC-CAP patients were older (p < 0.01) and more likely to have underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma and bronchiectasis (p < 0.01). Approximately half of asthmatic MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients had asthma attacks. Although winter is an influenza season in Japan, co-infection with influenza virus was less common in MC-CAP compared to SP-CAP patients (3% vs. 15%, p < 0.01). Bronchopneumonia patterns on X-ray, as well as bronchial wall thickening, bilateral distribution, and segmental pattern on CT were more common in MC-CAP patients than in SP-CAP patients (p < 0.01). Sputum Gram stain was highly useful method for the diagnosis in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP (78.4% vs. 89.2%), and penicillins were most frequently chosen as an initial treatment for both pneumonias. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that MC-CAP occurred in older people compared to SP-CAP, influenza virus co-infection was less common in MC-CAP than SP-CAP, and that MC-CAP frequently caused asthma attacks. Gram stain contributed for the appropriate treatment, resulting in conserving broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients."

The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae in CAP is well-understood, but its role in HAP is unclear. AIM: The objective of this study was to summarize the available literature on the prevalence of S. pneumoniae in HAP episodes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for peer-reviewed articles on the microbiology of HAP in individuals aged >=18 years, published between 2008-2018. We calculated pooled estimates of the prevalence of S. pneumoniae in episodes of HAP using a random-effects, inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 47/1908 articles met the inclusion criteria. Bacterial specimen isolation techniques for microbiologically-defined HAP episodes included bronchoalveolar lavage, protective specimen brush, tracheobronchial aspirate and sputum, as well as blood culture. Culture was performed in all studies; five studies also used urine antigen detection (5/47; 10.6%). S. pneumoniae was identified in 5.1% (95%CI: 3.8-6.6%) of microbiologically-defined HAP episodes (n=20), with 5.4% (95%CI: 4.3-6.7%, n=29) in ventilator-associated HAP and 6.0% (95%CI: 4.1-8.8%, n=6) in non-ventilator-associated HAP. S. pneumoniae was identified in 5.3% (95%CI: 4.5-6.3%) of HAP occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU, n=41) and in 5.6% (95%CI: 3.3-9.5%, n=5) outside the ICU. A higher proportion of early-onset HAP (10.3%; 95%CI: 8.3-12.8%, n=16) identified S. pneumoniae as compared to late-onset HAP (3.3%; 95%CI: 2.5-4.4%, n=16). CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae was identified by culture in 5.1% of microbiologically-defined HAP episodes. The importance of HAP as part of the disease burden caused by S. pneumoniae merits further research."

Differentiation of S. pneumoniae from other similar species using traditional culture-based and molecular methods is problematic. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of identifying the blpA and lytA for the detection of S. pneumoniae from isolates and various clinical samples using molecular methods. Methods: A total of 440 clinical samples were collected from patients with suspected invasive pneumococcal infections during February 2016 to October 2018. Biochemical tests were used to confirm the dubious colonies on 5% sheep blood agar. Fifty-seven confirmed isolates, 57 culture-positive samples, and 57 culture-negative samples were analyzed for the presence of blpA and lytA using both conventional and real-time PCR. Results: All the isolates and culture-positive samples were positive for blpA and lytA by both PCR methods. Of the 57 culture-negative samples, conventional and real-time PCR amplified blpA from six and two samples, and lytA from seven and two samples, respectively. Conclusion: The specificity of real-time PCR assay was significantly higher than that of conventional PCR for the identification of S. pneumoniae. In addition, it is suggested that respiratory secretions are not suitable specimen for direct diagnosis of pneumococcal infections."

MinION (Oxford Nanopore) is a real-time third generation sequencer whose portability, affordability and speed in data production make of it an attractive device for whole genome sequencing. The objective of this study is to evaluate MinION sequencer for pathogen identification and molecular characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated at a children's Hospital. Whole genome sequencing of 32 Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolates, previously characterized by standard methods (Quellung reaction, Multiplex PCR and Sanger-MLST), were performed. DNA was extracted using ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep kit. Quantification and purity of DNA was assessed by Qubit and Nanodrop, respectively. Library preparation was performed using the Rapid Barcoding Kit. Real-time workflow EPI2ME platform ""What's it in my pot"" was used for species identification. Fast5 sequences were converted into FASTQ by Albacore software. Reads were assembled using CANU software. PathogenWatch, genomic epidemiology and pubmlst online tools were used for capsular typing and/or whole genome-MLST profile. RESULTS: Rapid identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae was achieved by ""What's in my pot"". Capsular typing was correctly assigned with PathogenWatch in all 32 isolates at serogroup level and 24 at serotype level. Whole genome-MLST results obtained by genomic epidemiology and pubmlst were consistent with double locus variant clonal complex obtained by Sanger-MLST in 31 isolates. CONCLUSION: MinION sequencer provides a rapid, cost-effective and promising pathway for performing WGS by a pocked-sized device for epidemiological purposes but improving its sequencing accuracy will make it more appealing to be used in clinical microbiology laboratories."

However, bacterial coinfection is considered relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the co-prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae is low. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients subsequently admitted to AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020, with documented SARS-CoV-2 and S. pneumoniae coinfection. RESULTS We identified 11 patients with S. pneumoniae coinfection. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 74-82 years), 45.5% (5/11) were males, 54.5% (6/11) were white, and 90.9% (10/11) were long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. The median length of stay was 7 days (IQR, 6-8 days). Among 11 patients, 4 were discharged in stable condition and 7 had died, resulting in an inpatient mortality rate of 64%. CONCLUSIONS At our center, 11 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection while in hospital. All patients had pneumonia confirmed on imaging and a nonspecific increase in markers of inflammation. The in-hospital mortality rate of 64% (7 patients) was higher in this group than in previous reports.

METHODS: We pooled the susceptibility and clinical data of CAP patients enrolled in five clinical trials conducted in three countries from 2006 to 2017. The published pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of oral (500 mg) and intravenous (IV; 500, 650, and 750 mg) nemonoxacin formulations and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of the two aforementioned CAP-related Gram-positive cocci (GPC) were used to determine plausible CBPs. Moreover, the nemonoxacin MIC distributions of CAP-relatedS. pneumoniae (n = 1,800) and S. aureus (n = 2,000) isolates were obtained to evaluate the ECOFF values using a visual estimation approach and ECOFFinder. RESULTS: More than 92% of the patients with CAP caused byS. pneumoniae or S. aureus with nemonoxacin MICs<=0.25 mg/L presented positive clinical and microbiological outcomes. The ECOFF, MIC90, and MIC99 values of nemonoxacin were 0.06, 0.125, and 1 mg/L, respectively, for the S. pneumoniae isolates, and 0.125, 1, and 8 mg/L for the S. aureus isolates, respectively. Based on the differences in the PK profiles of oral and IV formulations, PD parameters of nemonoxacin for these CAP-GPC, and clinical in vivo efficacy data, tentative CBPs of 0.5, 0.5, and 1 mg/L were established for the 500-mg oral and 500- and 750-mg IV nemonoxacin formulations, respectively, for S. pneumoniae, and 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/L, respectively, for S. aureus.

Because empiric therapies for CAP should cover the major pathogens, reports examining CAP aetiology are considered crucial, particularly in Nordic countries that still rely on penicillin G or V treatments for most patients with CAP. The primary objective of our study was to report CAP aetiology. Secondary objectives included the estimation of positivity rates for different tests and the odds of a positive test for various subgroups. METHODS: In this cohort study, microbiological data were analysed for an overall cohort (variable degree of microbiological testing) and for a subgroup that was tested for both, bacteria, viruses and fungi, using routine methods (defined as extensive testing). RESULTS: The overall cohort comprised 2,264 patients, including 315 who were extensively tested. Bacterial and viral monoinfections were the most commonly identified infections. The dominant pathogen identified among extensively tested patients was Haemophilus influenzae (23.7%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.6%). The tests with the highest positivity rates were sputum cultures (34.7%) and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR, 24.4%). The odds of achieving a microbiological diagnosis increased significantly when extensive testing was performed compared with selective testing (OR 2.86, 95% CI 2.24-3.64). CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that H. influenzae is the dominant responsible pathogen for bacterial CAP in Denmark. Thus, we believe that the current treatment recommendations that encourage the use of penicillin G or V for the majority of patients with CAP need to be revised."

We aimed to describe common aetiologies of acute febrile illness among children in a setting where malaria transmission has declined. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged at least 2 months and under 13 years presenting with fever (temperature of >=37.5  C or a history of fever in the past 48 h) to Hawassa Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, southern Ethiopia, from May 2018 through February 2019. Clinical and demographic data were gathered for consecutive participants, and malaria microscopy, HIV testing, and blood and urine cultures were performed regardless of clinical presentation. Additionally, stool analyses (culture and rotavirus/adenovirus RDT) and throat swab for group A Streptococcus (GAS) and urine Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed by RDTs for children with specific conditions. The antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates was determined using disc diffusion method. RESULTS: During the study period 433 children were recruited, median age 20 months (range, 2 months - 12 years) and 178 (41.1%) female. Malaria was diagnosed in 14 (3.2%) of 431 children, and 3 (0.7%) had HIV infection. Bacteraemia or fungaemia was detected in 27 (6.4%) of 421 blood cultures, with Staphylococcus aureus isolated in 16 (3.8%). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were detected in 74 (18.4%) of 402, with Escherichia coli isolated in 37 (9.2%). Among 56 children whose stool specimens were tested, 14 (25%) were positive for rotavirus, 1 (1.8%) for Salmonella Paratyphi A, and 1 (1.8%) for Shigella dysenteriae. Among those with respiratory symptoms, a throat swab test for GAS and urine test for S. pneumoniae were positive in 28 (15.8%) of 177 and 31 (17.0%) of 182, respectively. No test was positive for a pathogen in 266 (61.4%) of 433 participants. Bacterial isolates were frequently resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION: Our results showed low proportions of malaria and bacteraemia among febrile children. In contrast, the frequent detection of UTI emphasize the need to support enhanced diagnostic capacity to ensure appropriate antimicrobial intervention."

A retrospective study was done by reviewing the microbiology registry of our hospital. Details of patients whose blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or any other sterile fluid grew S. pneumoniae between the period January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019 were collected. Identification and susceptibility testing were done by Vitek2 as per CLSI 2008 guidelines. Serotyping was attempted for 39 isolates. Fifty-five pneumococcal isolates in blood and CSF were identified over four years from 51 patients, of whom nine belonged to the paediatric age group. Among 55 isolates, 50 were isolated from blood, four had growth of pneumococci in both blood and CSF, and one had growth in CSF alone. Overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was noted in 11 isolates, and 10 isolates were non-susceptible to ceftriaxone. Common serotypes isolated were 9V, 19F, 23F and 6 B. The most common clinical presentation was pneumonia followed by sepsis and meningitis. Five of the 51 patients succumbed to the illness. Penicillin susceptibility among pneumococcal isolates in IPD was 80% and susceptibility to ceftriaxone was 82%. This observation reiterates the view that vancomycin must be added to the empiric therapy of suspected IPD. Most of the identified serotypes are covered by current pneumococcal vaccines, highlighting the pivotal role of pneumococcal vaccine in prevention of IPD."

Any positive Aspergillus test from any respiratory sample was found in 10.9% of the COVID-19 patients, 6.2% of the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and 22.9% of those infected with influenza. A positive culture or PCR or galactomannan test on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) only was found in 5.4% of COVID-19 patients, which was lower than in patients with influenza (18.8%) and comparable to pneumococcal pneumonia group (4.6%). Using logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio, OR (95% CI) for a positive Aspergillus test on BAL fluid for COVID19 patients was 1.2 (0.3 to 5.1, p=0.8) compared to the pneumococcal pneumonia group while it was 0.2 (0.1 to 0.8, p=0.02) compared with influenza group.

Despite its prevalence, ABS is often overlooked in young children. The diagnosis and management present unique challenges in primary care. This is an updated narrative review on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of ABS. Methods: A PubMed search was performed using the key term 'acute sinusitis'. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and children. Results: Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the major pathogens in uncomplicated ABS in otherwise healthy children. In complicated ABS, polymicrobial infections are common. The diagnosis of acute sinusitis is mainly clinical and based on stringent criteria, including persistent symptoms and signs of a URI beyond 10 days, without appreciable improvement; a URI with high fever and purulent nasal discharge at onset lasting for at least 3 consecutive days; and biphasic or worsening symptoms. Conclusion: Data from high-quality studies on the management of ABS are limited. The present consensus is that amoxicillin-clavulanate, at a standard dose of 45 mg/kg/day orally, is the drug of choice for most cases of uncomplicated ABS in children in whom antibacterial resistance is not suspected. Alternatively, oral amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day can be administered. For those with severe ABS or uncomplicated acute sinusitis who are at risk for severe disease or antibiotic resistance, oral high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day) is the drug of choice."

Key characteristics of S. pseudopneumoniae are the absence of a pneumococcal capsule, insolubility in bile, resistance or indeterminate susceptibility to optochin when incubated in 5% CO2 but susceptibility to optochin when incubated in ambient air, and a positive reaction with the AccuProbe DNA probe hybridization test. The clinical importance of this bacterium is currently unknown. We report the characteristics and associated clinical data of 35 strains of S. pseudopneumoniae isolated from sputum samples from 33 patients. All isolates produced a positive result with the NOW S. pneumoniae antigen test (Binax, Inc.). No isolate was resistant to penicillin, but 60% were resistant to erythromycin and 77% were resistant to tetracycline. All patients had lower respiratory tract symptoms, 79% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 33% had chest radiographic infiltrates. Compared with matched control patients who had Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from sputum, patients with S. pseudopneumoniae infection were more likely to have a history of COPD (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67 to 20.11) or exacerbation of COPD (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.61 to 16.20). Further research is needed to better characterize the epidemiology of S. pseudopneumoniae colonization and the role of S. pseudopneumoniae in COPD and other diseases."

However, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions have been reported. In this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of HIV-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. Conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci as Streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all bile soluble. However, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. Genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true S. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. Of these, 10 most closely resembled a subgroup of Streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. CGH also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the non-typable isolates. Sequencing of part of the 16S rRNA gene and investigation for the presence of ply by PCR corroborated these results. In conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the Mitis group, and show that both MLSA and CGH enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other Mitis group streptococci."

Very scanty information is available on the isolation of S. pseudopneumoniae from India. Hence, the present study was an attempt to isolate S. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to study their drug resistance pattern. METHODS: Sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. Alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin susceptibility in 5 per cent CO2 and ambient air. Disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. RESULTS: Among the samples screened, 4 per cent showed the growth of only S. pseudopneumoniae. Other pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans. All the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed presence of S. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with RTI. Currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent CO2 as S. pneumoniae and the resistant ones are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. As a result, S. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. Hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent CO2 and ambient air along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. pseudopneumoniae."

One-hundred and thirty-two isolates were characterized by: optochin susceptibility in ambient and CO(2)-enriched atmosphere; bile solubility; PCR-based assays targeting pneumococcal genes lytA, ply, pspA, cpsA, Spn9802, aliB-like ORF2, and a specific 16S rRNA region; multilocus sequence analysis; and antimicrobial susceptibility. By multilocus sequence analysis, 61 isolates were S. pseudopneumoniae, 34 were pneumococci, 13 were S. mitis, and 24 remained unclassified as non-pneumococci. Among S. pseudopneumoniae isolates, 51 (83.6%) were collected from respiratory tract samples; eight isolates were obtained from sterile sources. High frequency of non-susceptibility to penicillin (60.7%) and erythromycin (42.6%) was found. Only 50.8% of the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates displayed the typical optochin phenotype originally described for this species. None harbored the cpsA gene or the pneumococcal typical lytA restriction fragment length polymorphism. The Spn9802 and the specific 16S rRNA regions were detected among the majority of the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates (n = 59 and n = 49, respectively). The ply and pspA genes were rarely found. A high genetic diversity was found and 59 profiles were identified. Among the S. pneumoniae, 23 were capsulated and 11 were non-typeable. Three non-typeable isolates, associated to international non-capsulated lineages, were recovered from invasive disease sources. In conclusion, half of the atypical pneumococcal clinical isolates were, in fact, S. pseudopneumoniae and one-fourth were other streptococci. We identified S. pseudopneumoniae and non-typeable pneumococci as cause of disease in Spain including invasive disease."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence of this new species in patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia in a university hospital setting using routine laboratory tests. Sputum samples (n = 213) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for culture from cases clinically diagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia are studied. Optochin variability in ambient air and 5% CO2 was the criterion used to identify S. pseudopneumoniae. Disc-diffusion and E-test on Muller Hinton blood-based agar were used for antibiotic susceptibility testing following Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute breakpoints. Out of the screened isolates, only six (3%) were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae. None of the commercial tests differentiated the pathogens from viridans streptococci so diagnostic laboratories need to provide an alternative identification algorithm. The six isolates showed susceptibility to penicillin, and five isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, but one exhibited low-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]: 1 mug/mL). All isolates showed high-level resistance to macrolides (MIC: 24- &gt; 256 mug/mL). Although S. pseudopneumoniae strains were not sufficiently frequent to justify routine additional incubation of sputum samples in ambient air, the high resistance pattern is alarming. Further surveillance is needed in diagnostic laboratories to understand the epidemiology and clinical significance of the newly described pathogen."

To describe the current nature of this disease in the UK, data was gathered on patients with clinical pneumonia from whom Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured principally from blood or other relevant normally sterile sites. In the Harrogate and Northallerton districts of North Yorkshire, pneumonia accounted for nine (20%) cases and a quarter of all deaths in a complete sequence of 45 patients with Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia detected during the 16-year-period 1981-1996. An analysis is presented of those cases together with eight recent cases from counties York, Durham and Isle of Wight during 1995-1997. Of the total 17 cases, nine occurred in women and eight in men; the age range was 30-92 years. The organism was isolated from blood culture in 15 (88%) patients. Eight (47%) patients died, five within 1 day of hospitalisation. Fourteen (82%) cases occurred in the winter months October to March, including all the fatal cases and all eight in which a clinical 'viral' prodrome was observed. Predisposing medical or surgical conditions were present in 65% of the patients. Major complications included septicaemia, pleural reaction, shock, pulmonary cavitation, osteomyelitis and metastatic abscesses. Seven serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes were encountered, with M-type 1 predominating (the cause in 60% of cases).

Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) is thought to be an uncommon cause of pneumonia in children with sickle cell anaemia. We report a 15-year-old African-American girl who presented with an acute chest event characterised by fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, right upper abdominal quadrant pain, jaundice and otitis media. Chest radiograph showed multi-lobar pneumonia with left pleural effusion. Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus was isolated from culture of pleural and middle ear fluids. She responded to therapy that included antibiotics, exchange blood transfusion, oxygen, thoracotomy chest tube drainage and decortication. In a child with sickle cell anaemia presenting with fever and an acute chest event, pneumonia should be considered and GABHS recognised as a possible aetiological agent.

All patients were previously healthy Japanese women who developed a profound shock, with a rapidly fatal outcome, after experiencing flu-like symptoms. All cases conformed to the case definition of toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS).Currently, the pathogenic mechanism of TSLS remains unclear. Known microbial virulence factors can not sufficiently explain the occurrence of TSLS, and it has been generally considered that host factors may be contributory. On pathological examination, each patient had one organ or tissue that was most severely involved: Case 1 a non-penetrating trauma; Case 2 a pregnant uterus; and Case 3 a pulmonary lesion reminiscent of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. On the basis of clinicopathological features of these cases, we propose that the coexistence of 'enhancing tissue focus' may be one of host factors for the progression of TSLS in patients infected with non-invasive GAS."

During the past 2 decades there has been a resurgence of invasive GAS infection, but no large study of GAS pneumonia has been performed. METHODS: To determine the clinical and epidemiologic features of GAS pneumonia, we conducted prospective, population-based surveillance of all invasive GAS infection in residents of Ontario from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1999. RESULTS: Of 2079 cases of invasive GAS infection, 222 (11%) represented GAS pneumonia. The incidence of GAS pneumonia ranged from 0.16 per 100 000 in 1992 to 0.35 per 100 000 in 1999. Most cases were community acquired (81%). Forty-four percent of nursing home-acquired cases occurred during outbreaks. The case fatality rate was 38% for GAS pneumonia, compared with 12% for the entire cohort with invasive GAS infection and 26% for patients with necrotizing fasciitis. The presence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (odds ratio, 19; 95% confidence interval, 8.4-42; P =.001) and increasing age (odds ratio per decade, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.7; P&lt;.001) were associated with fatal outcome. Time to death was rapid, with a median of 2 days despite antimicrobial therapy and supportive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Group A streptococcal pneumonia is a common form of invasive GAS disease but remains an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Progression is rapid despite appropriate therapy. The incidence is similar to, and the case fatality rate higher than, that of necrotizing fasciitis."

METHODS: Data regarding clinical and laboratory features were abstracted retrospectively from medical records of 76 subjects with complicated parapneumonic effusions at a tertiary children's hospital from 1996 through 2001. Incidence rates per 10 000 hospital discharges and per 1000 patients with nonviral pneumonia were calculated. RESULTS: Etiologic organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 subjects), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (5), Abiotrophia sp. (1) and no culture-confirmed agent (32). The annual incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions per 10 000 discharges progressively increased from 4.5 in 1996 to 25.0 in 1999 (P = 0.0001), then declined to 10.1 in 2001 (P = 0.03). Similarly the incidence per 1000 cases of nonviral pneumonia increased from 2.9 in 1996 to 11.0 in 1999 (P = 0.003) and then declined to 4.8 in 2001 (P = 0.053).

However, neither serotype was significantly associated with specific clinical manifestations, which suggests that manifestation development among IGASI might be attributable to host or environmental factors rather than the pathogen. In our study, these factors included age, gender, underlying medical conditions, and living environment, yet none explained temporal changes in risk for pneumonia and soft-tissue infections."

We report an outbreak of GAS pneumonia that occurred at a US military training camp. METHODS: Standard epidemiologic and laboratory procedures were used to characterize the outbreak and causative organism(s). A case-control study and determination of the prevalence of GAS infection among camp personnel were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 162 of 4500 Marine Corps personnel were hospitalized for respiratory symptoms during the period of 1 November and 20 December 2002, and 127 (78%) had radiographically confirmed pneumonia. The attack rate was 1.6 cases per 100 person-months. Thirty-four (27%) of 127 patients with pneumonitis had definite or probable GAS pneumonia; an additional 22 (17.3%) were coinfected with GAS and another pathogen. Pathogens, in addition to GAS, included Chlamydia pneumoniae (27 patients), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (19), adenovirus (5), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2). A survey revealed that the pharyngeal carriage rate of GAS among camp personnel was 16%. Molecular characterization of the GAS isolates found emm type 3, multilocus sequence type 15. The epidemic ended after administration of additional prophylaxis with a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin (1.2 million U) or azithromycin (1 g orally). Because the number of days from the last penicillin injection was correlated with a positive throat culture result and the occurrence of pneumonia, the dosing interval of benzathine penicillin was shortened from every 28-35 days to every 21 days. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest outbreak of GAS pneumonia reported in &gt;30 years. This outbreak emphasizes the potential for GAS to cause epidemics of severe infection and demonstrates the need for surveillance and consideration of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis among particularly high-risk populations."

An outbreak of S. pyogenes, type M12, T12, occurred in a large long-term care institution serving the ill and chronically disabled. The outbreak involved 14 residents of the intermediate care facility and lasted for 4 months. METHODS: A prospective epidemiologic investigation was initiated at the onset of the outbreak. Pertinent clinical and demographic information regarding both residents and personnel was obtained by interview, review of medical and surveillance records, and examination of patients for lesions. Cultures were obtained within 24 hours of symptom onset from those with characteristic clinical symptoms. Unpaired convalescent sera were tested for group A streptococcal extracellular antigens by a rapid hemagglutination slide test. Control measures included active surveillance of residents and staff for suspicious clinical syndromes, transfer of high-risk patients, elimination of a common seating area, and improved handwashing and hygiene measures. RESULTS: The attack rate was 7.5%, with 64.3% of these patients residing on one unit. S. pyogenes was isolated from eight residents, 5 residents had a characteristic syndrome and an elevated streptozyme hemagglutination titer of 400, and 1 resident died within hours of having cellulitis of the groin. Clinical syndromes included cellulitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and septicemia. Seven residents required acute care; two residents died within 3 weeks of the onset, yielding a case fatality rate of 14.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The major means of transmission appeared to be direct contact between residents, although transmission from an infected staff member may have accounted for some cases. The hypothesis of long-term colonization was supported by the extended times between infections. The severity of illness and the apparent transmission through direct contact between residents warrants (1) early detection of infected lesions, (2) recognition of invasive illness, (3) prompt effective treatment, and (4) surveillance for S. pyogenes infections among residents and personnel."

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features and incidence of parapneumonic effusions throughout an 11-year period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged &lt; 15 years old with parapneumonic effusions from 1993 to 2003. Annual incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 children &lt; 15 years old from Health Area 5 of Madrid and per 100 children hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department of our hospital. The linear association test was used to compare the incidence rates over the previous 11 years. RESULTS: There were 130 patients with parapneumonic pleural effusions. The mean age was 4.7 years. Forty-one percent received antibiotics before diagnosis. The causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (32.3%). The most effective diagnostic method was pleural-fluid culture (18/58, 31%). The most common organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (18), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Haemophilus influenzae (3) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2). Thirty-two percent of the patients required pleural drainage and 16% underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Of 12 S. pneumoniae antibiograms available, 91.7% showed full susceptibility to penicillin and 75% were susceptible to erythromycin. The annual incidence of parapneumonic effusions rose from 18.1 in 1993 to 42.9 in 2003 (p &lt; 0.001) per 100,000 children and from 0.76 in 1993 to 3.3 in 2003 (p &lt; 0.001) per 100 children hospitalized in our unit. CONCLUSION: The incidence of parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia showed a statistically significant increase between 1993 and 2003.

Uncertainty in differentiating bacterial from viral infection is the main reason for this practice. More evidence is needed to encourage proper use of antibiotics for URI. OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine the prevalence of Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci (GAS) in adults with URI and clinical features associated with GAS infection. 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of management of adults with URI using the Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG). MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was conducted on adult out-patients with URI at Siriraj Hospital from April to October 2004. Throat swab cultures were performed in all participants. Patients were assessed and managed according to CPG adapted from principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Out of 292 patients enrolled, 55.5% had non-specific URI/common cold, 32.2% had pharyngitis/ tonsillitis, 11% had acute bronchitis and only 1.4% had acute sinusitis. The overall prevalence of GAS infection was 7.9%. GAS was isolated in 16% of the patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis; and only 3.7% and 3.1% of the patients with non-specific URI/common cold and acute bronchitis respectively. Clinical manifestations associated with GAS were: 1)fever (T &gt; or = 37.8 C), 2) exudate on the pharynx or tonsil, 3) tender cervical lymphadenopathy, and 4) absence of cough. The presence of &lt; or = 3 of 4 criteria had high negative predictive value of 94.2%.

Further, its clinical course in comparison to pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia has not been previously highlighted. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of children 0-18 years of age from April 1983 to April 2005, with discharge diagnoses of invasive disease caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes), or Streptococcus pneumonia (SP) or pneumonia. Data were extracted from the charts, and a comparison of clinical characteristics between the 2 etiologies was performed. Confirmed disease required blood or pleural fluid isolates. Patients with single isolates of GAS in tracheobronchial secretions or sputum were classified as having presumed disease caused by GAS. Patients with confirmed disease due to GAS and SP were compared with respect to clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 103 patients with invasive GAS disease, 12 (11.6%) had confirmed GAS lobar pneumonia. In addition 7 patients had presumed GAS pneumonia. There were 54 patients with confirmed SP pneumonia. Most children who had GAS pneumonia were healthy and recovered completely. Compared with patients with confirmed SP pneumonia, those with confirmed GAS pneumonia had more frequent and larger effusions, more culture positive effusions, had prolonged fever, and had longer hospitalizations. There was not an increasing trend to GAS pneumonia over the 22-year period. There was not a predominant serotype responsible for the pneumonias. CONCLUSIONS: Lobar GAS pneumonia represents approximately 11% of all cases of invasive disease in this institution during a 22-year period. Compared with patients with SP pneumonia, it appears to cause more effusions and morbidity. The organism is also more frequently recovered from pleural fluid."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pyogenesID:1709390TITLE:Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bacterial respiratory infections.ABSTRACT:Some studies suggest a potential role for bacterial respiratory tract infections in the development of bronchospasm and the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis have exaggerated airway reactivity; croup in children can also cause exaggerated upper and lower airway responsiveness. Bronchial obstruction after inhalation of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacteria has been reported. Between January 1989 and June 1990 we and two other centers studied 193 patients suffering from acute exacerbation of asthma. Fifty-two (27%) of these patients had bacteria in their sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and H influenzae were the most commonly isolated bacterial species. Antibiotics may be of value in the treatment of infective lung disease, not only by killing bacteria but also by preventing increases in bacterial histamine levels within the lung airways. Moreover, an antibiotic of proven efficacy can reduce airway reactivity in patients with bacterial exacerbations of COPD or bronchial asthma. In 12 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of asthma and high airway reactivity to methacholine, a ten-day course of treatment with cefaclor and existing bronchodilators induced microbiologic cure and a slight but nonsignificant change in airway reactivity in nine patients. Antibiotic therapy has a minor but clear role in the control of acquired bronchial hyperreactivity during bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic patients; however, because of airway inflammation, an antibiotic's efficacy is evident only when the inflammatory process subsides. Approaches designed to minimize airway reactivity may contribute to the prevention or reversal of respiratory failure during exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma."

DESIGN: Prospective, population-based surveillance for invasive GAS infections was conducted in Ontario from January 1992 until June 2002. All 62 patients meeting clinical and/or histopathologic criteria for invasive GAS who were admitted to the ICUs of four university-affiliated hospitals in Toronto, Canada were included. Demographic and clinical information were obtained retrospectively by chart review. ICU morbidity data included the occurrence of organ dysfunction (renal, hepatic, coagulation, ARDS), treatment, and interventions such as hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: ARDS developed in 34%, renal dysfunction developed in 55%, hepatic dysfunction developed in 64%, and coagulopathy developed in 69% of patients. A total of 56% of patients were treated with IV polyspecific IgG (IVIG), 81% were intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation, and 21% required renal replacement therapy. The median durations of ICU and hospital stay were 5.3 days and 15.0 days, respectively. The overall mortality was 40%. Mortality correlated directly with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and the number of dysfunctional organs. Survivors were younger, had lower severity of illness scores, fewer dysfunctional organs, and were less likely to have shock or to receive treatment with vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, or pulmonary artery catheters. There was no association between the use of IVIG, surgical intervention, or clindamycin, and survival. Variables independently associated with mortality on multivariable analysis were the presence of coagulopathy (p = 0.0005) and liver dysfunction (p = 0.0123). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with invasive GAS infection admitted to the ICU have a high mortality rate. In this group of patients, coagulopathy and liver failure were independently associated with mortality. We did not observe any association between the use of IVIG, surgical intervention, or clindamycin, and survival."

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: A 146-bed nursing home facility in northern Nevada. METHODS: We defined a case as the isolation of GAS from a normally sterile site in a resident of nursing home A. To identify case patients, we reviewed resident records from nursing home A, the local hospital, and the hospital laboratory. We obtained oropharyngeal and skin lesion swabs from staff and residents to assess GAS colonization and performed emm typing on available isolates. To identify potential risk factors for transmission, we performed a cohort study and investigated concurrent illness among residents and surveyed staff regarding infection control practices. RESULTS: Six residents met the case patient definition; 3 (50%) of them died. Among invasive GAS isolates available for analysis, 2 distinct strains were identified: emm11 (3 isolates) and emm89 (2 isolates). The rate of GAS carriage was 6% among residents and 4% among staff; carriage isolates were emm89 (8 isolates), emm11 (2 isolates), and emm1 (1 isolate). Concurrently, 35 (24%) of the residents developed a respiratory illness of unknown etiology; 41% of these persons died. Twenty-one (30%) of the surveyed employees did not always wash their hands before patient contacts, and 27 (38%) did not always wash their hands between patient contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent respiratory illness likely contributed to an outbreak of invasive GAS infection from 2 strains in a highly susceptible population. This outbreak highlights the importance of appropriate infection control measures, including respiratory hygiene practices, in nursing home facilities."

Notably, infections due to group A and group B beta-hemolytic strains are well known for causing invasive disease leading to death. These deaths, while often suspected clinically, occasionally are not diagnosed until autopsy. We present 3 rapid deaths, with very different presentations, due to streptococcal infection. Two decedents experienced sudden deaths due to pneumonia and severe meningoencephalitis caused by group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, a common cause of neonatal meningitis but only rarely reported in nonpregnant adults. The final case involves a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of shoulder pain but over the next several hours developed signs of necrotizing fasciitis, became septic, and died. While antemortem cultures were negative, owing to antibiotic administration, postmortem cultures of bone and deep soft tissue were positive for group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus sp. Acute and sudden deaths due to infectious etiology represent an uncommon yet well-documented occurrence.

The low CH50 indicated a complement-mediated injury. Renal biopsy was done showing immune complex-mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis consistent with postinfectious etiology. The patient received pulse dose steroids for 5 days followed by oral steroids. His urinary output improved along with normalization of his renal function, therefore dialysis was discontinued. We are presenting this case to alert clinicians to the possibility of postinfectious glomerulonephritis following pneumococcal pneumonia and to report the successful use of steroid therapy in such a situation."

She had 1-week history of sore throat, fever and cough. She had been to a neighboring clinic three days previously, and had been prescribed some medication for bronchitis, but her symptoms had not improved. By the time of admission, she was already in shock and had severe respiratory failure. Laboratory data showed renal dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, CPK elevation and severe metabolic acidosis. Chest x-ray and CT films revealed consolidation of the entire right lung field. The patient was quickly intubated and we began mechanical ventilation. We immediately initiated broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunogloblin, dopamine hydrochloride and gabexate mesilate, but she died 7 hours later. From cultures of blood and sputum taken from the patient, Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated. On the basis of these clinical and bacteriological findings, we confirmed a diagnosis of pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (STSS). Serologically her M protein was serotyped as M1, and with regard to Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes were identified as speA and speB. These serological findings were consistent with the most frequent type that causes STSS. In spite of the uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes can potentially affect healthy individuals. The pneumonia can be complicated with STSS and so the clinical course may be severe and fulminant. The evidence acquired from this case suggests that in the event of severe pneumonia with shock, we should be aware that this may represent the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes and/or toxic shock syndrome."

AIMS: To characterise a population of patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion and to establish possible prognostic factors on admission based on clinical, imaging and analytical data. To correlate treatment options with the outcome. METHODS: Case review of patients under 18 years old with parapneumonic pleural effusion, admitted between July 1997 - June 2004 (7 years). RESULTS: 118 patients were included, 60% male, with mean age 7 years. The incidence of pleural effusion increased throughout the period of the study. The admissions occurred predominantly in autumn and winter. On admission 60% of patients had respiratory distress and 39% chest pain. In 40% loculations were found on admission and were associated with longer hospital stay, longer course of antibiotic therapy and more frequent need for surgery. Thoracentesis was performed in 72% of patients (mean pH pleural fluid 7.24). The aetiologic agent was identified in 17% of cases: Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Staphylococcus aureus (four) and Streptococcus pyogenes (four). In our study, 52% of patients underwent pleural drainage and 18% surgery. Median length of hospital stay was 15 days with mean 16.4 days (2 - 51). DISCUSSION: Factors associated with worse prognosis were respiratory distress, loculations, empyema, low pH in pleural fluid, glucose or proteins in pleural fluid, high lactic dehydrogenase level in pleural fluid and high serum C-reactive protein. Pleural drainage and/or surgery can shorten hospital stay and improve outcome.

She was treated with a combination of 3 g/day of cefotaxime and 1.8 g/day of clindamycin with a good clinical response and discharged from the hospital in good conditions. Although this microorganism is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia, previously healthy individuals may be infected and the clinical course may be fulminant. Patients with invasive GAS infection admitted to ICU have a high mortality rate. Treatment of choice of Group A streptococcal infection is penicillin. However, clindamycin should be added in severe infections ."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pyogenesID:19401798TITLE:Thoracic empyema - a review based on three cases reports.ABSTRACT:Complicated parapneumonic effusion is one in which an invasive procedure is necessary for its resolution and empyema means pus in the pleural space. An early diagnosis and therapy of these conditions results in less morbidity and mortality. CT of the chest is important to study complex pleural effusions. Loculated effusions, those occupying more than 50% of the thorax, or which show positive Gram stain or bacterial culture, or a purulent effusion with a pH below 7.20, with a glucose level below 60 mg/dl or a LDH level more than three times the upper limit of normal for serum, are indications for an invasive procedure. These characteristics result from the evolution of a not well treated parapneumonic effusion, through the three stages: (1) exsudative; (2) fibrinopurulent; (3) fibrotic. Depending on the stage therapeutic methods vary from therapeutic thoracentesis, insertion of a chest tube with or without instillation of fibrinolytics, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and lung decortication. A review of all these aspects are done based on a series of three cases reports with very different clinical presentation: one patient with empyema by Streptococcus pyogenes and that died rapidly due to massive hemoptysis; a patient with empyema due to acute pneumonia developing during an airflight; a patient with empyema and bacteraemia by Streptococcus pneumonia leading to the diagnosis of an unknown HIV infection."

Instances resulting in fulminant disease among health care workers have not been described. Contact and droplet precautions have been advised to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission. We aimed to determine whether a case of invasive GAS pneumonia and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in a respiratory therapist was acquired as a result of caring for a patient with GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Contacts of these patients were screened to determine if they were the reservoir of the GAS. Genetic testing to confirm clonal transmission was conducted. METHODS: Contacts of the patients with GAS infection were screened using questionnaires and testing of pharyngeal specimens. Specimens from patients and carriers of GAS who were identified during screening were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and emm gene typing. RESULTS: We identified 705 contacts of the 2 patients; all contacts had oropharyngeal specimens collected for culture. Only the index patient and the respiratory therapist yielded identical pulse-field gel electrophoresis GAS isolates, with clonality indicated by emm typing. CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial transmission of GAS from a patient to a health care worker who developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome may have occurred after the index patient had received 48 h of antibiotic therapy and despite placement in contact isolation. Isolation guidelines for patients with severe GAS infection may need to be reviewed."

To help determine the role of bacterial coinfection in the current influenza pandemic, CDC examined postmortem lung specimens from patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) for bacterial causes of pneumonia. During May 1-August 20, 2009, medical examiners and local and state health departments submitted specimens to CDC from 77 U.S. patients with fatal cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). This report summarizes the demographic and clinical findings from these cases and the laboratory evaluation of the specimens. Evidence of concurrent bacterial infection was found in specimens from 22 (29%) of the 77 patients, including 10 caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Duration of illness was available for 17 of the 22 patients; median duration was 6 days (range: 1-25 days). Fourteen of 18 patients for whom information was available sought medical care while ill, and eight (44%) were hospitalized. These findings confirm that bacterial lung infections are occurring among patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and underscore both the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and the need for early recognition of bacterial pneumonia in persons with influenza."

In April 2009, a previously unknown 2009 influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) emerged, causing a global influenza pandemic. We examined the relationship between circulating 2009 H1N1 and the occurrence of secondary bacterial parapneumonic empyema in children. METHODS: Children hospitalized with parapneumonic empyema from August 2004 to July 2009, including a period when the 2009 H1N1 circulated in Utah, were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We compared the average number of children diagnosed with influenza A and the number of admissions for empyema per month for the previous 4 seasons to rates of empyema during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. We identified causative bacteria using culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: We observed an increase in hospitalization of children with pneumonia complicated by empyema during a severe outbreak of 2009 H1N1 during the spring and summer of 2009, compared with historical data for the previous 4 seasons. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were the predominant bacteria identified. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous pandemics, secondary bacterial infection with S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were associated with the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. There is an urgent need to better understand bacterial complications of pandemic influenza. In the interim, influenza vaccines, antiviral agents, and pneumococcal vaccines should be used to prevent cases of secondary bacterial pneumonia whenever possible."

Our study characterises cases of CAP admitted to hospital and compares this data with a 2001 study. We collected data on 63 admissions over a six-month period. The majority were aged 0-2 years old. Chest X-ray showed consolidation/atelectasy in 58 (92.1%) and pleural effusion (PE) in 17 (27.0%), of which 11 were empyema (17.4% of all admissions). The bacterial agent was isolated in five cases: Streptococcus pyogenes (two, pleural fluid), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two, blood culture) and Haemophilus influenzae (one, blood culture). Sixty-one children (96.8%) were prescribed antibiotherapy. The median length of hospital stay was five days. Patients with PE were older, had a longer course of fever, higher inflammatory parameters, longer hospital stay and longer course of iv antibiotics. Compared to the prior study we found greater severity of CAP, with higher prevalence of PE and empyema. Nevertheless there was a shorter course of fever during hospital stay and shorter hospital stay. We also noticed less antibiotic prescription prior to admission and greater prescription of ampicillin during hospital stay. In the literature, the higher severity of CAP has been partially attributed to the emergence of more aggressive serotypes of Stretococcus pneumoniae not included in the heptavalent vaccine. There is therefore a greater interest in new vaccines containing them. Complicated CAP should be referred to centres specialising in its diagnosis and management."

The patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as defined by British Thoracic society, from December 1998 to Dec 2000, at the Sher- i-Kashmir institute of Medical Sciences Soura, Srinagar, India. Gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). In 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7/29), Escherichia coli (6/29), Klebsiella spp. (3/29), Streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and Acinetobacter spp. (1/29). Sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). Maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). The commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), COPD (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). Fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, Pseudomonas in two, Klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. The factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of COPD or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. The overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. This emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for Legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of CAP."

While a leading role has been so far attributed solely to Influenza A as the primary infective pathogen, Influenza B is generally considered to be less pathogenic with little impact on morbidity and mortality of otherwise healthy adults. This report documents the severe synergistic pathogenesis of Influenza B infection and bacterial pneumonia in previously healthy persons not belonging to a special risk population and outlines therapeutic options in this clinical setting. CASE PRESENTATION: During the seasonal influenza epidemic 2007/2008, three previously healthy women presented to our hospital with influenza-like symptoms and rapid clinical deterioration. Subsequent septic shock due to severe bilateral pneumonia necessitated intensive resuscitative measures including the use of an interventional lung assist device. Microbiological analysis identified severe dual infections of Influenza B with Streptococcus pyogenes in two cases and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one case. The patients presented with no evidence of underlying disease or other known risk factors for dual infection such as age (&lt; one year, &gt; 65 years), pregnancy or comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza B infection can pose a risk for severe secondary infection in previously healthy persons. As patients admitted to hospital due to severe pneumonia are rarely tested for Influenza B, the incidence of admission due to this virus might be greatly underestimated, therefore, a more aggressive search for influenza virus and empirical treatment might be warranted. While the use of an interventional lung assist device offers a potential treatment strategy for refractory respiratory acidosis in addition to protective lung ventilation, the combined empiric use of a neuraminidase-inhibitor and antibiotics in septic patients with pulmonary manifestations during an epidemic season should be considered."

The annual average incidence of invasive disease was 2 episodes per 100,000 inhabitants (3.1 for children and 1.9 for adults). The most frequent clinical manifestations were cellulitis (41.3%), bacteremia without focus (19.0%), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (12.6%), and pneumonia (7.7%). Among 247 invasive isolates analyzed, the most prevalent clones were emm1/ST28 (27.9%), emm3/ST15-406 (9.8%), and emm4/ST39 (6.5%). The emm1/ST28 clone was the only clone detected each year throughout the study period and was associated with more than one third of all fatal outcomes. When invasive isolates were compared with 1,189 non-invasive isolates, the emm1/ST28 clone was significantly associated with invasive disease. The speA and ssa genes were more frequent among invasive emm1 and emm4 isolates, respectively. Forty-two (17%) invasive isolates were resistant to erythromycin (21 harbored the mef gene and 21 the ermB or ermA genes). Twenty-two (8.9%) isolates had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 2-8 mug/mL) and 32 (13%) were tetracycline-resistant (tetM or tetO gene).

Among the 1542 invasive GAS strains studied, 78% (n=1206) were from blood cultures, and a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) was described in 22% (n=340) of cases, mainly associated with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and pleuro-pulmonary infections (p&lt;0.001). The in-hospital fatality rate was 15%. A total of 83 different emm types were recovered but the three predominant emm types, representing almost 60% of the isolates, were emm1 (24%), emm28 (17%) and emm89 (15%). The preponderance of each emm type varied according to the year, with a significant constant increase of emm28 strains, whereas emm1 strains, representing approximately 32% of GAS invasive isolates in 2007 and 2008, dropped to &lt;15% in 2010 (p&lt;0.001). The distribution of phage-associated superantigen genes (speA, speC and ssa) was linked to certain emm types. Between 2006 and 2010, the percentage that was macrolide-resistant decreased from 11% to 5%, confirming the trend observed in 2007.

Data were collected from the Norwegian infectious disease notification system and supplemented by active search for cases of bacteraemia and other serious infections in addition to serotyping of selected clinical bacterial isolates. The number of reported cases of non-invasive GAS infections from week 29/1987 to week 28/1988 was 60% higher than expected. Between 1 Jan. and 30 June 1988, 84 cases of bacteraemia were notified, several with fulminant septicaemia and shock. The case fatality rate was 25%. Six cases of neonatal GAS septicaemia were seen. There was a nearly 3-fold total increase in occurrence of GAS bacteraemia compared with previous years, and the increase was marked particularly in cases among older children and adults 30-50 years old. Additional culture-confirmed diagnoses included unusual cases compared to recent decades such as pneumonia with empyema, necrotising fasciitis and primary peritonitis. Serotyping of strains collected consecutively from localized infections revealed a marked predominance of T-type 1, opacity factor negative strains (T-1 OF-), ranging from 41% in North Norway to 87% in Mid-Norway. M-typing confirmed that these strains were M-1, as were 87% of the preserved bacteraemia strains from the period described. Although most of the M-1 strains were distinctly mucoid only one case of acute rheumatic fever was reported during the first half of 1988. We conclude that an epidemic of GAS infections caused by M-1 strains has occurred in Norway resulting in an increase in both incidence and seriousness of disease."

Necrotizing fasciitis occurred in only 55% of cases, with none involving pneumococcal infection. Laboratory tests typically showed C-reactive protein elevation but without leukocytosis, indicating a high-level inflammatory state. In ten cases, death was attributed to circulatory collapse due to sepsis; severe pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage were present in these cases.

Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains.

Diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia requires supportive care, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis and respiratory failure. Hemoptysis, abscess, empyema and gangrene are possible complications and surgical intervention may be required. The authors present a clinical case of pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia in a patient without important risk factors and favourable progression with medical therapy. In this regard, a brief bibliographic review about this pathology is also made."

More than 65,000 deaths attributable to influenza and pneumonia occur annually in the United States. Data from 683 critically ill patients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection admitted to 35 intensive care units in the United States reveal that bacterial coinfection commonly occurs within the first 6 days of influenza infection, presents similarly to influenza infection occurring alone, and is associated with an increased risk of death. Pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, are most commonly isolated. Complex viral, bacterial, and host factors contribute to the pathogenesis of coinfection. Reductions in morbidity and mortality are dependent on prevention with available vaccines as well as early diagnosis and treatment."

Distribution and antibiotic sensitivity to 45 agents of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice].ABSTRACT:The bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in Sendai city during the period from March in 1988 to February in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic."

The patients ranged in age from 1 day to 15 years, with patients younger than 5 years, including three neonates, accounting for a half of the patients. The disease was sepsis in four patients, skin and soft tissue infection in three patients, retropharyngeal abscess in two patients, pneumonia plus sepsis in one patient, empyema in one patient, and pyogenic arthritis in one patient. One patient with sepsis died, while cure without sequelae was achieved in all the remaining patients. When classified by type, emm1 (six strains) was the most prevalent type, followed by emm12 (two strains). The MIC90/MBC90 values were 0.015/0.015 mug/mL for penicillin G, 0.03/0.03 mug/mL for ampicillin, 0.015/0.03 mug/mL for cefotaxime, 0.03/0.03 mug/mL for ceftriaxone, 0.008/0.008 mug/mL for panipenem, 0.008/0.008 mug/mL for meropenem, and &lt;=0.004/&lt;=0.004 mug/mL for doripenem, indicating the superior antimicrobial activities of carbapenem.

During his convalescence, the patient developed persistent fever, lethargy and anorexia. His inflammatory markers were elevated, and repeat cultures were negative. Although the patient had none of the classical mucocutaneous features of Kawasaki disease, an echocardiogram was performed, which revealed coronary artery dilation. The patient was diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki disease and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose acetylsalicylic acid. The fever subsided within 48 h. To the authors' knowledge, the present report is the first report of Kawasaki disease associated with complicated S pyogenes pneumonia. It emphasizes the importance of considering incomplete Kawasaki disease among children with persistent fever, the role of echocardiography in diagnosis, and the potential link between Kawasaki disease and superantigen-producing organisms such as S pyogenes.

The literature describes influenza A epidemics leading to prolific loss of lives, notably the 1918 epidemic was blamed for the deaths of 40 to 50 million people. In this report, four patients were infected by influenza B during the influenza epidemic of 2011/12 in Hong Kong. All of them were previously healthy and had no chronic diseases; they were admitted to the hospital due to influenza-like symptoms. They rapidly deteriorated with multi-organ failure, and were subsequently diagnosed to be infected with influenza B and streptococci that gave rise to severe pneumonia. Three of them were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae and one with Streptococcus pyogenes. All of them had leukopenia, septic shock, and acute kidney injury; two of whom died despite aggressive antibiotic treatment and organ support in the intensive care unit. According to the literature, this is the second case report of severe invasive pneumococcal pneumonia secondary to influenza B infection. "

METHODS: Using recent literature and local expert opinion, institutional guidelines for obtaining blood cultures in pediatric patients with CAP were developed. A retrospective chart review of children treated in the emergency department or admitted for CAP from January 2010 through June 2011 was conducted. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including results of blood cultures. Chi2 tests assessed for variables associated with bacteremia, whether a blood culture was obtained, and if the decision to obtain a culture was appropriate based on our guidelines. RESULTS: The study included 330 patients; 155 (47%) blood cultures were obtained in our patient population. Five cultures were true-positive findings, making the prevalence of bacteremia 3.2% in patients with blood cultures and 1.5% in all patients. All 5 true positive results met criteria for blood culture based on our guidelines. Applying our guidelines retrospectively, the decision to obtain a blood culture met criteria in 55% of the cases. Bivariate analysis showed that patients discharged from the emergency department had higher rates of guideline-appropriate decisions than patients admitted. Radiographic findings were associated with making a guideline-appropriate decision regarding blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: Instituting local guidelines that limit the frequency of obtaining blood cultures in pediatric patients with CAP is likely to capture any patient with bacteremia. This study suggests that blood cultures may not need to be routinely obtained in all patients admitted to the hospital with CAP."

We investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. METHODS: A retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. RESULTS: There were 40 (2.3%) PICU patients with streptococcal isolations including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS, n = 7), Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS, n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. Comparing among GAS, GBS and SP, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for GAS or SP (P = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for GBS (P = 0.002). All GAS and GBS, and the majority of SP (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. All SP specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. These infections were associated with high PICU mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. Isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. Patients with GAS, SP or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI), P value] of PICU deaths of 7.5 (CI 3.1-18.1, P &lt; 0.0001), 4.5 (CI 2.0-9.8, P &lt; 0.0002) and 5.7 (CI 3.4-9.5, P &lt; 0.0001), respectively. In SP, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +- seizure disorders, chromosomal or genetic disorders (P = 0.003) than children &lt;5 years of age. Serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19A, 6B, 3 and 6C. There were four SP deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two 19A and two serotype 3). CONCLUSIONS: Severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. GAS and SP affect the lungs of children, whereas GBS more likely causes meningitis in infants. The expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19A, 19F, 6B and 3."

The present study aimed to assess the epidemiology of GAS in Taiwan and identify factors associated with ERY resistance. All 127 ERY-resistant (ERY(r)) isolates and 128 randomly selected ERY-susceptible (ERY(s)) isolates recovered from 1998 to 2010 were emm typed. ERY(r) isolates were also characterized by ERY resistance phenotype and mechanisms and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Multilocus sequence typing was performed on selected ERY(r) isolates. The predominant emm types in ERY(r) isolates were emm22 (n = 33, 26.0%), emm12 (n = 24, 18.9%), emm4 (n = 21, 16.5%), and emm106 (n = 15, 11.8%). In ERY(s) isolates, emm12 (n = 27, 21.9%), emm1 (n = 18, 14.1%), emm106 (n = 16, 12.5%), and emm11 (n = 9, 7.1%) predominated. The most common ERY resistance phenotype was the M phenotype (resistant to macrolides) (70.9%), with all but one isolate carrying mef(A), followed by the constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance (cMLSB) phenotype (26.8%), with isolates carrying erm(B) or erm(TR). ERY(r) isolates of the emm12-sequence type 36 (ST36) lineage with the cMLSB phenotype were mostly present before 2004, while those of the emm22-ST46 lineage with the M phenotype predominated in later years. Recovery from respiratory (throat swab) specimens was an independent factor associated with ERY resistance. emm1 and emm11 GAS isolates were significantly associated with ERY(s), while emm22 was detected only in ERY(r) GAS. In addition, emm106 isolates were prevalent among the abscess/pus isolates, whereas emm12 isolates were strongly associated with a respiratory (throat) origin. In addition to identifying factors associated with ERY resistance in GAS, our study provides helpful information on the changing GAS epidemiology in Taiwan. "

We aimed to determine bacterial prevalence rates for 5 common childhood ARTI - acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis- and to compare these rates to nationally representative antimicrobial prescription rates for these ARTI. METHODS: We performed (1) a meta-analysis of English language pediatric studies published between 2000 and 2011 in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library to determine ARTI bacterial prevalence rates; and (2) a retrospective cohort analysis of children age &lt;18 years evaluated in ambulatory clinics sampled by the 2000-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) to determine estimated US ARTI antimicrobial prescribing rates. RESULTS: From the meta-analysis, the AOM bacterial prevalence was 64.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.5%-77.7%); Streptococcus pyogenes prevalence during pharyngitis was 20.2% (95% CI, 15.9%-25.2%). No URI or bronchitis studies met inclusion criteria, and 1 sinusitis study met inclusion criteria, identifying bacteria in 78% of subjects. Based on these condition-specific bacterial prevalence rates, the expected antimicrobial rescribing rate for ARTI overall was 27.4% (95% CI, 26.5%-28.3%). However, antimicrobial agents were prescribed in NAMCS during 56.9% (95% CI, 50.8%-63.1%) of ARTI encounters, representing an estimated 11.4 million potentially preventable antimicrobial prescriptions annually. CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 27.4% of US children who have ARTI have bacterial illness in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era. Antimicrobials are prescribed almost twice as often as expected during outpatient ARTI visits, representing an important target for ongoing antimicrobial stewardship interventions."

We determined the common bacterial pathogens causing CAP in Nigeria and further reviewed their antibiotic senstivity patterns with a view to providing recommendations to improve antibiotic management of CAP. METHODS: Case notes of all adult patients who were 18 years or more admitted to four major tertiary hospitals in South East Nigeria with a diagnosis of CAP between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively studied. To be eligible, patients were required to have sputum culture and sensitivity results available. Socio-demographic, clinical, pre-admission and in-hospital treatment data were also obtained. RESULTS: Of 400 patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of CAP, 232 fulfilled the study criteria; 122 (52.6%) were women and the mean age was 50.6 +- 18.8 years. Aetiological agents were identified from sputum in 189 (81.5%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 90, 47.6%) was the most frequent isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 62, 32.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 24, 12.7%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13, 6.9%). The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin (77%), ceftazidime (75.5%) and ofloxacin (55.8%). The susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics most frequently presecribed for empirical therapy was low (co-amoxiclav, 47.6%; ciprofloxacin, 45.9% and ceftriaxone, 47.6%) and this was associated with higher mortality and/or longer duration of hospital stay in survivors. CONCLUSION: Strep. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae were the most common causes of CAP. The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime. We suggest that these antibiotics should increasingly be considered as superior options for empirical treatment of CAP in Nigeria."

Diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. Technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were &lt;5%. The use of the qPCR assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. Diagnostic accuracy of the qPCR assay varied between 60% positive agreement with standard tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 100% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Negative percentage of agreement was &gt;95% for M. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; whereas it was only 56% for Haemophilus influenzae.

A clear conceptualisation of bronchopneumonia resulting from viral-bacterial interactions between pathogens was developed, and prevention and treatment approaches were developed and optimised in real time. These approaches were used in the 1918 influenza pandemic, which began as the measles epidemic waned.

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pyogenesID:26619910TITLE:Unexplained persistent postpartum palpitations and tachycardia due to Group A Streptococcus.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus is one of the most morbid infections in modern obstetric practice. Pregnant women are known to have a 20-fold increased risk of invasive Group A Streptococcus with greatest risk in the first 4 days postpartum. The overwhelming majority of these infections will present with fever, uterine tenderness, or vaginal discharge. A much smaller subset may present to the Emergency Room after initial hospital discharge with much less obvious symptoms. In our case, persistent palpitations with unexplained tachycardia led to improper diagnosis in multiple Emergency Rooms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37 year-old Caucasian female presents with four post-partum days of unexplained sinus tachycardia and absence of fever, uterine tenderness, or vaginal discharge, which elicits an extensive cardiac and pulmonary workup in multiple Emergency Rooms. Consequent late diagnosis of invasive Group A Streptococcus infection lead to significantly increased morbidity including toxic shock syndrome, acute renal failure, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, multiple laparotomies, fasciotomy, intubation, continuous renal replacement therapy, and extensive hospital course and recovery. CONCLUSION: Persistent palpitations with unexplained tachycardia in the post-partum patient in the Emergency Room setting is a potential early warning of Group A Streptococcus infection. Even in the absence of reported clinical fever, uterine tenderness, or vaginal discharge, an early speculum and pelvic exam, with or without consultation with the obstetrics service, is prudent due to the potentially high morbidity or even fatality of Group A Streptococcus infection."

This study assessed the epidemiology of community-acquired pediatric pleural empyema in the province of Quebec through validation of cases found in a hospitalization discharge database. METHODS: We used the national administrative database of hospitalization to identify children (6 months-14 years) hospitalized for pleural empyema or pleural effusion with drainage from January 1990 until December 2007 and reviewed their medical charts. Patients with pleural effusion secondary to chest trauma, thoracic surgery, malignancies, cardiac failure, or metabolic disorders were excluded. RESULTS: Predictive positive value (PPV) of empyema code in any position among discharge diagnostics in the administrative database was 86.5% (95% confidence interval: 81.9%-90.3%). After chart revision, 292 met the inclusion criteria. Age-adjusted incidence of pleural empyema in the pediatric population increased from 0.23 in 1990 to 4.01/100,000 person-years in 2007. A bacterial pathogen was identified in 46.5%; Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) (42%) and S pyogenes (30%) were most frequent. There was no obvious change in the PPV and proportions of children with chronic disease or asthma and in identified pathogens over time, but an increase in pre-admission respiratory symptoms duration (from 3.8 days to 5.7) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (from 0% to 19%) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: From 1990 to 2007, we observed a 10-fold increase in the incidence of pediatric hospitalizations associated with pleural empyema. This increase preceded the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugated vaccine program in Quebec. Sp remained the major pathogen identified."

Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients."

However the rate of occult bacteremia in infants with RSV infection is not well established. The aim was to determine the actual rate and predictive factors of bacteremia in children admitted to hospital due to confirmed RSV acute respiratory illness (ARI), using both conventional culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study (GENDRES-network) was conducted between 2011-2013 in children under the age of two admitted to hospital because of an ARI. Among those RSV-positive, bacterial presence in blood was assessed using PCR for Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to conventional cultures. RESULTS: 66 children with positive RSV respiratory illness were included. In 10.6% patients, bacterial presence was detected: H. influenzae (n = 4) and S. pneumoniae (n = 2). In those patients with bacteremia, there was a previous suspicion of bacterial superinfection and had received empirical antibiotic treatment 6 out of 7 (85.7%) patients. There were significant differences in terms of severity between children with positive bacterial PCR and those with negative results: PICU admission (100% vs. 50%, P-value = 0.015); respiratory support necessity (100% vs. 18.6%, P-value &lt; 0.001); Wood-Downes score (mean = 8.7 vs. 4.8 points, P-value &lt; 0.001); GENVIP scale (mean = 17 vs. 10.1, P-value &lt; 0.001); and length of hospitalization (mean = 12.1 vs. 7.5 days, P-value = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Bacteremia is not frequent in infants hospitalized with RSV respiratory infection, however, it should be considered in the most severe cases."

AIM AND MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study aimed to identify current clinical episodes of S. pyogenes pneumonia, its relationship with influenza virus circulation and the genotypes of the involved isolates during a decade in a Southern European region (Gipuzkoa, northern Spain). Molecular analysis of isolates included emm, multilocus-sequence typing, and superantigen profile determination. RESULTS: Forty episodes were detected (annual incidence 1.1 x 100,000 inhabitants, range 0.29-2.29). Thirty-seven episodes were community-acquired, 21 involved an invasive infection and 10 developed STSS. The associated mortality rate was 20%, with half of the patients dying within 24 hours after admission. Influenza coinfection was confirmed in four patients and suspected in another. The 52.5% of episodes occurred outside the influenza seasonal epidemic. The 67.5% of affected persons were elderly individuals and adults with severe comorbidities, although 13 patients had no comorbidities, 2 of them had a fatal outcome. Eleven clones were identified, the most prevalent being emm1/ST28 (43.6%) causing the most severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes pneumonia had a continuous presence frequently unrelated to influenza infection, being rapidly fatal even in previously healthy individuals."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present our clinical-surgical experience with deep neck abscesses. METHODS: A retrospective study analyzed 101 patients diagnosed with deep neck abscesses caused by multiple etiologies, assisted at a medical school hospital during 6 years. One hundred one patients were included and 27 (26.7%) were younger than 18 years old (the children group), 74 patients (73.3%) were older than 18 years old (the adults group). The following clinical features were analyzed and compared: age, gender, clinical symptoms, leukocyte count, the affected cervical area, lifestyle habits, antibiotic therapy, comorbidities, etiology, bacterial culture, time of hospitalization, the need of tracheostomy and complications. RESULTS: There was predominance in the male gender (55.5%) and young people (mean age 28.1 years). All of the 51 patients with associated disease comorbidity were adults. The most frequent etiologies were bacterial tonsillitis (31.68%) and odontogenic infections (23.7%). The most common cervical areas affected were the peritonsillar (26.7%), submandibular/mouth floor (22.7%) and parapharyngeal spaces (18.8%). In children group, the site most commonly involved was the peritonsillar space (10 patients, 37%). In adults group, the site most commonly involved was multispace (31 patients, 41.8%). Streptococcus pyogenes (23.3%) was the most common microorganism present. Amoxicillin associated with clavulanate (82.1%) was the more used antibiotic. The main complications of abscesses were septic shock (16.8%), pneumonia (10.8%) and mediastinitis (1.98%). Tracheostomy was necessary in 16.8% of patients. The mortality rate was 1.98%. CONCLUSION: The clinical features and severity of DCA varied according to different age groups, perhaps due to the location of the infection and a higher incidence of comorbidity in adults. Thus, DCA in adults is more facile to have multispace involvement and lead to complications and seems to be more serious than that in children."

The role of conventional and molecular microbiological tests.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: An increasing incidence of parapneumonic effusion and pleural empyema (PPE/PE) has been reported in recent studies. As only few data on etiology of PPE/PE in Central Europe have been reported, we undertook a study on the etiology of PPE/PE in children, using both standard culture and molecular techniques. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between June 2011 and December 2013. Consecutive children with PPE/PE complicating community acquired pneumonia, who required diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis were included. Blood and pleural fluid samples for microbiological cultures were collected. Molecular methods were applied to identify Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses in pleural fluid. RESULTS: The study group included 64 children, median age 4 (1-15). Seven of 64 (10.9%) blood cultures and 11 of 64 (17.2%) pleural fluid cultures revealed bacterial growth. The most common bacteria detected was S. pneumoniae (13 blood and pleural fluid samples from 11/64 (17.2%) children). DNA sequences of typical bacteria were found in 29/64 (45.3%) pleural fluid samples. S. pneumoniae was identified in 90% of these samples. The most common serotypes were: serotype 6B in 9/26 (36.6%), 19A in 6/26 (23%), serotype 3 in 3/26 (11.5%), 6A and 23F (both in 2/26 i.e. 7.7%) patients. Molecular methods identified atypical bacteria in 8/58 (13.8%) and respiratory viruses in 12/58 (20.7%) pleural fluid samples. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, in particular serotype 6B and 19A, is the most common etiologic agent of PPE/PE in Polish children. The use of PCR significantly improves pathogen identification in pleural fluid."

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of PCACP hospitalizations in the three major hospitals in Jerusalem in the years 2001-2010 for demographics, clinical presentation, management, and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 144 children (51% aged 1-4 years), 91% of Jewish origin; 40% had para-pneumonic effusion (PPE), 40% empyema (EMP), and 20% necrotizing pneumonia (NP). Bacterial origin was identified in 42% (empyema 79%, P = 0.009), most common S. pneumoniae (32%), group A streptococcus (9%). Patients with EMP, compared to PPE and NP, were less likely to receive prior antibiotic treatment (35% vs. 57% and 59%, respectively, P = 0.04). Mean hospitalization was longer in patients with NP followed by EMP and PPE (16.4 +- 10.6, 15.2 +- 7.9, and 12.7 +- 4.7 days, respectively), use of fibrinolysis was not associated with the outcome.

However, the occurrence of some GAS pneumonia cases is relatively rare in a local community. We report here characteristics of mucoid GAS isolates obtained from the sputum of two patients with pneumonia in a local community. Although case-patients did not have contact with each other, case-patient 1's child and case-patient 2's grandchild attended the same kindergarten where a GAS pharyngitis epidemic had occurred. We conducted phenotypic and genotypic analyses with the GAS isolates from sputum of both patients, to examine (1) colony appearance between the isolates, (2) numerical profile based on API-20 Strep system, (3) similarity to the type strain using 16S rRNA sequencing, (4) emm type (subtype) and emm full-length sequence, (5) sequence type, (6) sic allele, (7) antimicrobial susceptibility result and the resistance determinant, (8) genome profile following a random amplified polymorphic DNA fragments, and (9) pattern of digested DNA fragments by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. These phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed similar matching between the isolates from both cases. Our findings suggest that when clinicians examine adult patients having infection with the mucoid GAS, they should confirm whether anyone within the same household also developed the infection and need to investigate epidemic situations in local communities, including kindergartens and elementary schools."

The aim is to identify those microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, descriptive and prospective study was conducted, including patients over 14 years with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia during a 383 consecutive day period. A record was made of sociodemographic variables, personal history, prognostic severity scales, progress, and pathogenic agents. The aetiological diagnosis was made using blood cultures, detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila urinary antigens, sputum culture, influenza virus and Streptococcus pyogenes detection. Categorical variables are presented as absolute values and percentages, and continuous variables as their means and standard deviations. RESULTS: Of the 287 patients included in the study (42% women, mean age 66+-22 years), 10.45% died and 70% required hospital admission. An aetiological diagnosis was achieved in 43 patients (14.98%), with 16 microorganisms found in 59 positive samples.

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pyogenesID:28260599TITLE:Peritonsillar abscess: clinical aspects of microbiology, risk factors, and the association with parapharyngeal abscess.ABSTRACT:PTA is a collection of pus located between the tonsillar capsule and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. It is considered a complication of acute tonsillitis and is the most prevalent deep neck infection (approximately 2000 cases annually in Denmark) and cause of acute admission to Danish ENT departments. Teenagers and young adults are most commonly affected and males may predominate over females. However, no studies of age- and gender-stratified incidence rates have previously been published. Furthermore, smoking may be associated with increased risk of peritonsillar abscess (PTA) development, although the magnitude of the association has not been estimated. Complications are relatively rare. They include parapharyngeal abscess (PPA), upper airway obstruction, Lemierre s syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, mediastinitis, erosion of the internal carotid artery, brain abscess, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The treatment consists of abscess drainage and antimicrobial therapy. There are three accepted methods of surgical intervension: needle aspiration, incision and drainage (ID), and acute tonsillectomy (a chaud). Internationally, there is a strong trend towards less invasive surgical approach to PTA treatment with avoidance of acute tonsillectomy, needle aspiration instead of ID, and in some cases even antibiotic treatment without surgical drainage. The preferred antibiotic regimen varies greatly between countries and centers. Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the only established pathogen in PTA. However, GAS is only recovered from approximately 20% of PTA patients. The pathogens in the remaining 80% are unknown. Culturing of PTA pus aspirates often yields a polymicrobial mixture of aerobes and anaerobes. As the tonsils of healthy individuals are already heavily and diversely colonized, the identification of significant pathogens is challenging. In addition, when studying PTA microbiology, one must consider diagnostic precision, collection, handling, and transportation of appropriate specimens, choice of methodology for detection and quantification of microorganisms, current or recent antibiotic treatment of patients, potential shift in significant pathogens during the course of infection, and factors associated with increased risk of PTA development.  The trend towards de-escalated surgical intervention and increasing reliance on antibiotic treatment, require studies defining the significant pathogens in PTA in order to determine optimal antibiotic regimens. Complications secondary to PTA may be avoided or better controlled with improved knowledge concerning the significant pathogens in PTA. Furthermore, identification of pathogens other than GAS, may lead the way for earlier bacterial diagnosis and timely intervention before abscess formation in sore throat patients. The identification and quantification of risk factors for PTA development constitutes another approach to reduce the incidence of PTA. As clinicians, we noticed that FN was recovered from PTA patients with increasing frequency and that patients infected with Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN) seemed to be more severely affected than patients infected with other bacteria. Furthermore, we occationally observed concomitant PPA in addition to a PTA, which made us hypothesize that PPA and PTA is often closely related and may share significant pathogens. Hence, our aims were: 1. To explore the microbiology of PTA with a special attention to Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN). 2. To elucidate whether smoking, age, gender, and seasons are risk factors for the development of PTA. 3. To characterize patients with PPA, explore the relationship between PPA and PTA, identify the pathogens associated with PPA, and review our management of PPA. In a retrospective study on all 847 PTA patients admitted to the ENT department at Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) from 2001 to 2006, we found that FN was the most prevalent (23%) bacterial strain in pus specimens. FN-positive patients displayed significantly higher infection markers (CRP and neutrophil counts) than patients infected with other bacteria (P = 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). In a subsequent prospective and comparative study on 36 PTA patients and 80 patients undergoing elective tonsillectomy (controls), we recovered FN from 58% of PTA aspirates. Furthermore, FN was detected significantly more frequently in the tonsillar cores of PTA patients (56%) compared to the tonsillar cores of the controls (24%) (P = 0.001). We also analysed sera taken acutely and at least two weeks after surgery for the presence of anti-FN antibodies. We found increasing levels (at least two-fold) of anti-FN antibodies in eight of 11 FN-positive (in the tonsillar cultures) PTA patients, which was significantly more frequent compared to none of four FN-negative PTA patients and nine of 47 electively tonsillectomized controls (P = 0.026 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Blood cultures obtained during acute tonsillectomy mirrored the bacterial findings in the tonsillar specimens with 22% of patients having bacteremia with FN. However, bacteremia during elective tonsillectomy was at least as prevalent as bacteremia during quinsy tonsillectomy, which challenges the distinction made by the European Society of Cardiology between quinsy and elective tonsillectomy, namely that antibiotic prophylaxis is only recommended to patients undergoing procedures to treat an established infection (i.e. PTA). Using PCR analysis for the presence of herpes simplex 1 and 2, adenovirus, influenza A and B, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and respiratory syncytial virus A and B, we explored a possible role of viruses in PTA. However, our results did not indicate that any of these viruses are involved in the development of PTA. Privious studies have documented an association between EBV and PTA in approximately 4% of PTA cases. In addition to the involvement of GAS, the following findings suggest a pathogenic role for FN in PTA: 1. Repeated high isolation rates of FN in PTA pus aspirates. 2. Higher isolation rates in PTA patients compared to electively tonsillectomised controls. 3. Development of anti-FN antibodies in FN-positive patients with PTA. 4. Significantly higher inflammatory markers in FN-positive patients compared to PTA patients infected with other bacteria. We studied the smoking habits among the same 847 PTA patients admitted to the ENT department, AUH from 2001 to 2006. We found that smoking was associated with increased risk of PTA for both genders and across all age groups. The increased risk of PTA among smokers was not related to specific bacteria. Conclusions on causality cannot be drawn from this retrospective study, but the pathophysiology behind the increased risk of PTA in smokers may be related to, previously shown, alterations in the tonsillar, bacterial flora or the local and systemical inflammatory and immunological milieu. Studying all 1,620 patients with PTA in Aarhus County from 2001 to 2006 and using population data for Aarhus County for the same six years, age- and gender-stratified mean annual incidence rates of PTA were calculated. The incidence of PTA was highly related to age and gender. The seasonal variation of PTA was insignificant. However, the microbiology of PTA fluctuated with seasons: GAS-positive PTA cases were significantly more prevalent in the winter and spring compared to the summer, while FN-positive PTA patients exhibited a more even distribution over the year, but with a trend towards higher prevalence in the summer than in the winter. In a series of 63 patients with PPA, we found that 33 (52%) patients had concomitant PTA. This association between PPA and PTA was much higher than previously documented. We therefore suggest that combined tonsillectomy and intrapharyngeal incision in cases where PTA is present or suspected. The results of our routine cultures could not support a frequent role of FN in PPA. Based on our findings suggesting that FN is a frequent pathogen in PTA, we recommend clindamycin instead of a macrolide in penicillin-allergic patients with PTA. Furthermore, cultures made from PTA aspirates should include a selective FN-agar plate in order to identify growth of this bacterium. Recent studies of sore throat patients document an association between recovery of FN and acute tonsillitis. Studying the bacterial flora of both tonsils in study II, we found almost perfect concordance between the bacterial findings of the tonsillar core at the side of the abscess and contralaterally. This finding suggests that FN is not a subsequent overgrowth phenomenon after abscess development, but that FN can act as pathogen in severe acute tonsillitis. Future studies of patients with FN-positive acute tonsillitis focusing on the optimal methods (clinical characteristics, culture, polymerase chain reaction, or other) for diagnosis and whether antibiotics (and which) can reduce symptoms and avoid complications are warranted. Until further studies are undertaken, we recommend clinicians to have increased focus on acute tonsillitis patients aged 15-24 years with regards to symptoms and findings suggestive of incipient peritonsillar involvement. We have conducted a number of studies with novel findings: 1. FN is a significant and prevalent pathogen in PTA. 2. Bacteremia during abscess tonsillectomy is no more prevalent than during elective tonsillectomy. 3. The development of anti-FN antibodies in FN-positive PTA patients. We have used novel approaches as principles to suggest pathogenic significance of candidate microorganisms: 1. Comparative microbiology between PTA patients and ""normal tonsils"". 2. Measurements indicating larger inflammatory response compared to clinically equivalent infection."

Changes in its epidemiology have been described in recent years, including an increase in invasive infections (iGAS). METHODS: A retrospective-descriptive study was conducted on children less than 15 years old, with GAS infections, in particular iGAS, and their complications from February 2004-April 2014. RESULTS: A total of 2,192 positive cultures were obtained of which 92.7% were pharyngeal cultures. Twenty-nine patients were admitted to hospital: 4 with suppurative complications, 7 post-infective, 14 iGAS, and 4 probable iGAS cases. There were no differences in the frequency of GAS isolations/year. Non-invasive isolates were more frequent in winter and spring (P&lt;.001), and 68.3% were in patients younger than 5 years. The incidence of iGAS was 2.1/100,000 children/year. There was no seasonality, and it was more frequent in younger children (P=.039). The most common diagnosis was pneumonia (6/14). Eight patients required intensive care. They were treated empirically with second or third-generation cephalosporin or with intravenous penicillin, and pneumonia required longer treatment times (P=.016). All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin, and 10.6% were resistant to erythromycin. The time spent in hospital was longer for iGAS than other cases (P=.028). No patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngotonsillitis caused by GAS is common in childhood, and its incidence is increasing in children younger than 5 years. At the moment, post-infectious complications are rare.

In China, GAS infections other than scarlet fever are not notifiable. In Shanghai, an epidemiological investigation was initiated after two successive severe pneumonia cases with one death in a digital factory, from where outbreaks are less widely reported. The investigation was performed using emm typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, superantigen profiling, and genome analysis. This enabled characterization of relatedness among the outbreak isolates and identification of the mobile genetic elements present. Among 57 patients with respiratory symptoms investigated in the factory, emm5 GAS strains were isolated from 8 patients. The eight GAS infection cases comprising one fatal severe pneumonia case, six influenza-like illness cases, and one pharyngitis case. Two risk factors were identified: adult with an age of 18-20 years and close contact with a GAS patient or carrier. GAS attack rate was 14.0% (8/57), and GAS carriage rate was probably around 2.7% (14/521) based on surveys in two nearby districts. All the 10 outbreak associated isolates were assigned to emm5 and sequence type ST-99 (emm5/ST-99), harbored superantigen genes speC, speG, and smeZ, and were assigned to two similar PFGE patterns (clones). Among the outbreak associated isolates, all carried ermA with resistance to erythromycin and inducible resistance to clindamycin, and eight (80%) carried a tetM gene with resistance to tetracycline. Among the 14 carriage isolates, 12 were emm12/ST-36, and 2 were emm1/ST-28, all with superantigen genes speC, speG, ssa, and smeZ. All the carriage isolates harbored ermB and tetM with resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. Genome analysis showed the two outbreak clones were closely related and possessed new prophages carrying virulence gene sdc and antibiotic resistance genes of ermA and tetM, which were not found in the emm5 reference strain Manfredo. This is the first report of a GAS outbreak in this type of workplace. The outbreak was caused by two closely related emm5 clones that differed from the predominant emm types circulating in China."

Experience at King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.ABSTRACT:OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical presentation, predisposing factors, and the outcome in patients with Group A Streptococcal bacteremia. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 33 pediatric and adult patients with Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia, admitted at King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from 2007 to 2015. Results: Thirty-three patient records, documenting bacteremia with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, were reviewed. Approximately 51.5% were pediatric and 48.5% were adult patients, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The most frequently reported complications were renal impairment (45.5%) and acute respiratory distress (21.2%), followed by localized infection (15.2%), pleural effusion (6.1%), abscess (9.1%), necrotizing fasciitis (9.1%), septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis (3%). There were 10 episodes of shock: 6 were in pediatric and 4 were in adult patients. At the end of the study period, 12.1% patients died from the illness, 81.1% recovered from illness with no sequelae, while 6.1% recovered with sequelae. Mortality was observed in 4 patients; of them, 3 were pediatric patients and one was an adult with co-morbidities. Conclusions: We have noted a minimal change in the disease pattern over the 28 years in Saudi Arabia. The management of invasive GAS infection depends on an accurate and timely diagnosis with an appropriate use of antimicrobial therapy. The highest risks appear to be related to chronic illness. Invasive Group A Streptococcal infection is known to have a high mortality rate."

METHOD: Retrospective single-center study over a 6-year period. Children between 3 months and 15 years of age, deceased or surviving and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of the university-affiliated hospital of Martinique for a community-onset SBI were included in this study. The optimality of the medical care before admission to the pediatric intensive care unit was assessed in a blinded fashion by two independent experts. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of the 30 children suffering from SBI could be analyzed. The median age was 3.7 years (IQR: 1.7-10.4); the mortality rate was 14 % (95 % CI: 1-27 %). Most frequently infections were pulmonary infections (48 %; 95 % CI: 29-67 %), followed by septic shock (44 %; 95 % CI: 25-63 %). Microbiological cultures were positive in 55 % (95 % CI, 36-74 %) (n=16) of the cases, with five pneumococcus and four Streptococcus pyogenes. Of the 29 children included in the study, 72 % (95 % CI: 55-89 %) (n=21) had received at least one episode of suboptimal care. Suboptimal care comprised delay in diagnosis (identification of serious symptoms) in 65 % (95 % CI: 47-83 %), a delay in seeking care in 41 % (95 % CI: 22-60 %), and a delay in the initiation of antibiotics or hemodynamic support in 45 % (95 % CI: 26-64 %) and 38 % (95 % CI: 20-56 %) of the cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal care was frequent in the initial management of SBI, particularly because of a delay in seeking care and the failure of physicians to recognize early signs of SBI. A large public information campaign, focusing on healthcare accessibility and better education of physicians in the early recognition of SBIs are means of improvement that need to be explored."

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term ""communityacquired pneumonia"". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Patents were searched using the key term ""community-acquired pneumonia"" from www.google.com/patents, http://espacenet.com, and www. freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS: Generally, viruses, notably respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common cause of community- acquired pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause across all age groups. Other important bacterial causes in children younger than 5 years include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In children 5 years or older, in addition to S. pneumoniae, other important bacterial causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. In the majority of cases, bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably distinguished from each other on clinical grounds. In practice, most children with pneumonia are treated empirically with antibiotics; the choice of which depends on the patient's age and most likely pathogen. Recent patents related to the management of community-acquired pneumonia are discussed. CONCLUSION: In previously healthy children under the age of 5 years, high dose amoxicillin is the treatment of choice. For those with type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives. For children with a non-type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cefixime, cefprozil, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime should be considered. In previously healthy children over the age of 5 years, macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are the drugs of choice."

All GAS strains were characterized (emm genotype, toxin gene profile and pulse-field gel electrophoresis subtype). Selected strains were sequenced and phylogenetic relationship established. Capacity to form biofilm and interaction with human pulmonary epithelial cells and macrophages were determined. Twenty-six GAS strains responsible for invasive infections (II) and 57 for non-II or colonization were isolated from patients (n = 66) or healthcare workers (n = 13). Seventy strains shared the same molecular markers and 69 the same PFGE pattern; 56 were sequenced. They all belonged to the emerging emm89 clade 3; all but 1 were clonal. Whole genome sequencing identified 43 genetic profiles with sporadic mutations in regulatory genes and acquired mutations in 2 structural genes. Except for two regulatory gene mutants, all strains tested had the same biofilm formation capacity and displayed similar adherence and invasion of pulmonary epithelial cells and phagocytosis and survival in human macrophages. This large outbreak of GAS infection in a post-surgery oncology unit, a setting that contains highly susceptible patients, arose from a strain of the emergent emm89 clade. No relationship between punctual or acquired mutations, invasive status, and strain phenotypic characteristics was found. Noteworthy, the phenotypic characteristics of this clone account for its emergence and its remarkable capacity to elicit outbreaks."

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of STSS caused by S. pyogenes (culture-confirmed) in 7 tertiary hospitals during 2010-2017 in China. Clinical and laboratory data were collected by reviewing the medical records. Results: Fifteen cases of STSS, including 9 males, were confirmed and the ages of the patients ranged from 6 months to 15 years, with median age of 3 years. All cases had the positive blood culture for S. pyogenes and only 3 cases had short course of beta-lactam treatment before blood culture. Medical evaluation was initiated within (5.1+-4.6) days after symptom onset. All patients had fever, and 13 patients had multiple organ dysfunction and 10 patients had disseminated intravascular coagulationl (DIC). Twelve cases had severe pneumonia with or without skin and (or) soft tissue infections. Underlying conditions included giant hemangioma of the skin in 2 patients and varicella in 1 patient. All isolated strains in 14 cases were sensitive to penicillin G, ceftriaxone/cefotaxime, vancomycin, but 12 and 13 isolates were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin, respectively. Eight patients died, and 5 of them died within 24 hours after admission. One patient was lost to follow-up after intended discharge against medical advice. Conclusion: STSS caused by S. pyogenes in children is a severe syndrome with rapid clinical progression and high mortality rate, and thus the pediatricians should be aware of STSS and immediately initiate aggressive treatment for the suspected cases."

It is thus important to promptly establish a diagnosis, provide hemodynamic support, and initiate appropriate antibiotics therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Asian man presented with ventricular fibrillation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was initiated 20 minutes after admission after unsuccessful conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation including five attempts of electrical cardioversion. On the sixth attempt, a sinus rhythm was obtained. A physical examination revealed a large abscess in his right gluteal region, and computed tomography showed a large low-density area in the right gluteus maximus. Blood examination revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, and creatinine kinase. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated diffuse hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 25%. A subsequent coronary angiography revealed normal findings. Therefore, we diagnosed our patient as having septic shock and conducted surgical drainage. A rapid antigen group A streptococcus test yielded positive results, which necessitated treatment comprising benzylpenicillin and clindamycin. He was successfully weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous hemodiafiltration 4 days later and ventilation 9 days later; he was later transferred to another hospital to receive a skin graft. CONCLUSIONS: Our case report is the first to demonstrate the successful treatment of cardiac arrest caused by streptococcal toxic shock syndrome via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy.

Torticollis, neck pain, and reduced neck mobility are the main clinical signs of presentation. Predisposing factors are trauma, hyperlaxity of the transverse and alar ligaments of the atlantoaxial joints, and surgical interventions carried out in this area. Several viral and bacterial pathogens have been reported as causative events of Grisel's syndrome, including Epstein-Barr virus, Kawasaki disease, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and other infectious agents. Grisel's syndrome linked to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection as the trigger has not previously been reported. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small prokaryotic microbe and a frequent etiologic factor of respiratory tract infections and, less frequently, of extrapulmonary body organs. The recognition of the Grisel's syndrome is based on clinical and neuroradiological investigations, and early diagnosis and specific treatment are crucial to the successful outcome of the disease. RESULTS: We report the case of an 8-year-old girl with Grisel's syndrome caused by an upper respiratory tract infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Diagnostic suspicion and treatment of Grisel's syndrome were established quickly by anamnestic and clinical data and confirmed by radiological findings. The girl was immediately treated with specific antibiotic therapy and cervical immobilization, thus preventing the most dangerous complications of the disorder.

Meropenem, azithromycin, large amounts of fluids, and noradrenaline were administered, and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was provided. The gross appearance of the aspirated sputum was ginger-like, and the gram-positive cocci in chains were identified as group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS), Streptococcus pyogenes. The blood sample culture test revealed negative results. Based on Stevens' criteria, the patient was finally diagnosed as having streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Antibiotics were switched to ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin as an antitoxin treatment, and the patient was discharged on day 33. Serotypes of GAS were T1, M1, and emm1. Superantigens spe A, spe B, and spe F were present, and spe C was absent. These observations were compatible with the clinical features of hypotension. GAS is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia, which when potentially complicated with STSS can lead to a high mortality rate, and the rapid progression is particularly a striking feature.

Microorganisms isolated from infections are more often non-susceptible to most available drugs. The microorganisms producing resistance mechanisms have been classified as so called alert pathogens. METHODS: We performed a total number of 3810 tests of bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum of patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases at the Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Tuberculosis at Public Clinical Hospital No 3 in Zabrze (Poland). The research was performed in the microbiological laboratory of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland. The analysis included Gram-positive and Gram-negative alert species strains. RESULTS: In the period of five years, 144 strains of alert microorganisms have been isolated. The percentage of Gramnegative alert pathogens producing ESBL and KPC increased. MRSA, Steptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes have been found to be the most often present among Gram-positive alert microorganisms. The lowest value of cultured alert pathogens (3.9%) was noted in 2008, whereas the highest (16.5%) in 2011. Gram-positive alert microorganisms showed resistance to macrolides and lincosamides, however, Gram-negative alert microorganisms showed the highest percentage of resistance to penicillins, penicillins with inhibitors and cephalosporins.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 78 year-old Israeli man, who was born in Iraq but lived in Israel for 66 years, presented with multi-organ failure including acute kidney and hepatic injury, coagulopathy, and lactic acidosis. He had a medical history including aortic valve replacement, diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and low back pain treated with repeated local steroid injections. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pyogenes and antibiotic treatment was switched to penicillin G, clindamycin, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Repeated physical examinations failed to identify the source of the bacteremia. On day 12 of hospitalization the serology results for Strongyloides stercoralis sent on admission, because of chronic eosinophilia, came back positive. A microscopic stool examination and stool polymerase chain reaction were positive for Strongyloides stercoralis. Ivermectin therapy was commenced and continued for a total of 4 weeks. He was discharged for rehabilitation after 25 days. He had no exposure to endemic countries or to immigrants. During many years he had multiple gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, cutaneous symptoms, chronic eosinophilia, and high immunoglobulin E levels.

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in all age groups. The skin is one of the main infection sites followed by the oropharynx. The skin carriage of certain pathogenic bacteria such as S. pneumoniae is often ignored or under-diagnosed. Finally, the mode of transmission of these infections remains uncertain. Here, we hypothesized that skin could play a role in the transmission of these infections. We collected 649 cotton swabs from a healthy population in Dielmo and Ndiop, rural Senegal. The sampling was carried out on the palm of the hands. After DNA extraction and actin control, qPCR targeting eight different bacteria was performed on 614 skin samples. We detected Streptococcus pneumoniae in 33.06% (203/614), Staphylococcus aureus in 18.08% (111/614) and Streptococcus pyogenes in 1.95% (12/614) of samples.

Over recent years, the frequency of pleural empyema has increased in children with influenza infection. We present a severe case of acute empyema caused by S.pyogenes after influenza A infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 39-year old woman was diagnosed as influenza A and received oral Oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. She had no vaccination of influenza A. Although her influenza A infection improved, she complained of fever and cough to our institute. Chest radiography showed encapsulated pleural effusion of the left lung and pleural effusion which was consistent with acute empyema. Then, she was diagnosed as having acute empyema and was admitted to our institute. Streptococcus pyogenes was identified by pleural fluid culture on day 4. thus, MNZ was changed to clindamycin (CLDM) 600 mg three times a day. While thoracic drainage with intrapleural urokinase and combination antibiotic therapy of ceftriaxone and CLDM were performed, her general condition and chest radiographic findings were not improved. She received video-assisted thoracic debridement on day 10. After the operation, the antibiotic therapy was changed to ABPC 6 g daily iv. Due to good clinical course, the antibiotic therapy was switched to oral amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily on day 28. Then, she was discharged.

Several studies have shown an increased incidence in the past years. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the characteristics and outcome of iGASD in children, and to determine changes in incidence or severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on children&lt;=16 years evaluated in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Madrid, and diagnosed with iGASD (June 2005-July 2013). An analysis was made of the demographics, symptomatology, microbiology, and treatment. The changes throughout the period studied were evaluated, as well as parameters associated with disease severity. RESULTS: The study included a total of 55 children with iGASD, with 33 (60%) females, and a median age of 48.5 (20.5-88.9) months. The most frequent clinical syndromes were cellulitis/subcutaneous abscess (21.8%), ENT abscess (20%), pneumonia (16.4%), osteoarticular infection (16.4%), and mastoiditis (12.7%). The incidence of iGASD (cases/105 emergencies/year) increased from 5.6 (4.2-7.2) between June 2005-May 2009 to 18.9 (15.1-26) between June 2009-May 2013; P=.057. Surgery and admission to PICU was required by 35 (63.6%) and 10 (18.2%) patients, respectively. Children in PICU were younger (26.5 vs 52.6 months, P=.116), had a higher C-reactive protein (24.5 vs 10.7mg/dl, P&lt;.001) and higher frequency of pneumonia (60 vs 7%, P&lt;.001). In the multivariate analysis, only C-reactive protein was a risk factor for admission to PICU (OR: 1.14 [1.004-1.286], P=.04). There were no sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: An increased incidence of iGASD was observed in the children in this study. Lower age, pneumonia, and higher C-reactive protein were associated with disease severity in this series."

Optimum care warrants a combination of surgical debridement, antibiotics and intensive care support. All cases of necrotising fasciitis in 10 years in the North East of Scotland were reviewed to investigate and improve patient care. METHODS: Cases between August 2006 and February 2016 were reviewed using case notes and electronic hospital records. Data including mode of admission, clinical observations, investigations, operative interventions, microbiological and clinical outcomes was collected and reviewed. Analysis required multidisciplinary input including microbiology, infectious disease, trauma and orthopaedics, plastic surgery and intensive care teams. RESULTS: A total of 36 cases were identified. The mean laboratory risk indicator for necrotising fasciitis (LRINEC) score was 7 and 86% of patients fulfilled the criteria for necrotising fasciitis. Patients were commonly haemodynamically stable upon admission but deteriorated rapidly; 36% of patients had a temperature of over 37.5 degrees C on initial observations; 29/36 patients were discharged, 6 patients died acutely (acute mortality rate of 17%); 18/31 of cases were polymicrobial with Streptococcus pyogenes, the common organism. Six amputations or disarticulations were performed from a total of 82 operations in this group, with radical debridement the usual primary operation. The mean time to theatre was 3.54 hours. Highly elevated admission respiratory rate (50 breaths/minute) was associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotising fasciitis presents subtly and carries significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion allows early diagnosis and intervention. We believe that a pan-specialty approach is the cornerstone for good outcomes."

The samples were collected from across Japan, biennially or triennially, between 1994 and 2016 and a defined level of resistance to fluoroquinolone was determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae exhibited stable and high rates of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones over the period examined. For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus the rate of resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was 81.3-93.5% and 83.2-94.2%, respectively, which was markedly higher than that of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, while sitafloxacin-resistant methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were isolated at 0.3-0.7% and 16.9-36.5%, respectively. The rate of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli increased from around 2-3% between 1994 and 1998 to around 35% in 2016, but the rate of fluoroquinolone-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae stayed high at over 94.6% during the study period. Although no fluoroquinolone-resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. was detected from 1994 to 2002, the resistance rate increased slightly after 2004 and reached to 1.9%-4.7% in 2016. The rate of fluoroquinolone-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract and respiratory tract infections improved during the period examined from 41.8-67.0% to 91.2-94.2%, and from 78.9-88.5% to 90.1-94.6%, respectively. Against Acinetobacter spp., the susceptibility rate of fluoroquinolones was almost constant at around 90%, but one multidrug-resistant isolate was detected in 2013. Overall, the susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was maintained over 20 years against tested bacteria except for MRSA and E. coli."

The aim of this study was to better characterize patient-, pathogen-, and disease-related factors in the phenomenon of unexpected infectious deaths. Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all community-based, unexpected infectious deaths in Ontario, Canada between January 2016 and December 2017. Patient-related information, infection-related information, and circumstances around the death were extracted for each case to facilitate descriptive analyses. Results: Of the 7506 unexpected deaths over the study period, 418 (6%) were due to infectious diseases. Bacterial pneumonia (43%) was the most common infectious syndrome, followed by disseminated infection with no clear focus (12%), peritonitis (10%), myocarditis (6%), and pyelonephritis (5%). A pathogen was identified in 210 cases (50%), with the most common being Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 30), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 25), Klebsiella spp. (n = 23), and Escherichia coli (n = 19). Prodromal symptoms were present in 68% of persons before death, with a median (interquartile range) duration of only 1.0 (0.0-4.0) days; just 30% of those who died had had recent healthcare contact before their death. Conclusion: Infectious diseases have the capacity to cause fulminant decline and death. The most common cause of unexpected infectious death is bacterial pneumonia, with a predominance of gram-positive bacteria. Given the rapidity of these deaths, preventing a majority of them would require upstream strategies to reduce infection susceptibility and transmission."

We searched the literature to establish whether PCV13 reduces PnPE, and to identify other pathogens causing pleural empyemas (PEs). Material and methods: From October 2005 to January 2018 (12.3 years) we performed active surveillance for all cases of PE at the General Hospital of Tijuana, Mexico. Isolates from pleural fluid (PF) were identified by conventional culture, and since 2014, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was added for all culture-negative PFs. Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes were detected by either Quellung reaction (Statens Serum Institute ) or PCR. Clinical, imagenological, laboratorial and microbiological evaluation was performed on each patient. Statistical analysis was purely descriptive. Results: A total of 64 PEs were identified (5.28/year). Median age was 51 months (1-191), hospitalization days 18 (4-35). Decortication was performed in 42%, and two children died (3.2%). Bacterial identification was obtained from 51 (80%). S. pneumoniae was the leading cause (29 = 56.8%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14 = 27.4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3-5 = 9%) and others (5 = 9.8%). PCV13 was initiated in May 2012, and its impact on serotype-specific PnPE was 81% (much fewer than serotype 3) and for all PnPE 56.1%; however, for all PE -2.1% due to an increase of PE caused by S. aureus for all but one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Conclusions: Following 12.3 years of active surveillance, PCV13 has shown impact on both serotype-specific and all PnPEs; however, an increase of PEs by MRSA has emerged. Continuous surveillance is crucial to establish whether this epidemiological finding is transitory or not."

The rapidly, emerging problem of antibiotic resistant Streptococcus pyogenes is a major issue nowadays. The present study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from upper respiratory tract infections in tertiary care hospital of south Karnataka. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted over a period of two years. The specimens were processed by Gram staining and aerobic culture. The bacteria were isolated as per standard protocols. The minimum inhibitory values and extent of antibiotic resistance of commonly used antimicrobials were analysed for the isolated strains. Results: A total of 2123 specimens were received from patients with respiratory tract infections, among which, 50 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were obtained. Out of these, 8% were not sensitive to penicillin. Using VITEK 2 system, the prevalence of resistances to cefotaxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone were 4.2%, 83%, 51%, 8.9%, 40% and 5.3% respectively. Conclusion: It is important to know about the prevalence of resistance and rising MIC values of commonly used antibiotics regarding Streptococcus pyogenes to avoid therapeutic failures."

Different management approaches exist for this condition. We evaluated a 14-day treatment with amoxicillin (AMX) with/without clavulanic acid (AMC) confirmed or modified by microbiological findings from pleural tap. Children &lt;=16 years of age with radiologically diagnosed PPE/PE and initial diagnostic pleural tap were included at University Children's Hospital Zurich from 2001-2015. AMX/AMC was given for 14 days and rationalized according to microbiological pleural tap results. Clinical and radiological follow-up was scheduled until six months or full recovery. In 114 of 147 (78%) children with PPE/PE a pathogen was identified by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or antigen testing. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 90 (79%), S. pyogenes in 13 (11%), and Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases (6%), all but two cultured pathogens (96%) were sensitive to AMX/AMC. One-hundred two of 147 (69%) patients received treatment with AMX/AMC for 14 days. They recovered more rapidly than patients with a different management (p = 0.026). Of 139 children with follow-up, 134 (96%) patients fully recovered. In conclusion, 14-day AMX/AMC treatment confirmed and rarely modified by microbiological findings from pleural tap resulted in full recovery in &gt;95% of children with PPE/PE."

We report the case of an adult woman with lactational amenorrhea and GAS vulvovaginitis progressing to STSS. She was admitted to our hospital because of fever, lethargy, and a 2-week history of vaginal discharge; she also had hypotension and multiple organ failure. Blood and urine cultures yielded gram-positive cocci and GAS. After 14 days of antimicrobial therapy, she fully recovered without any complications. The vulvovaginitis was most likely the portal of entry for GAS, which is rarely recognized as a causative pathogen of vulvovaginitis. Lactational amenorrhea is thought to be a risk factor for GAS vulvovaginitis. It is important for clinicians to recognize the possibility of GAS vulvovaginitis in breastfeeding women with vaginal symptoms and consider the necessity of prompt antibiotic treatment."

We sought to determine characteristics of children with bacteremic pneumonia using data from a large prospective study with systematic blood culturing. METHODS: Children &lt;18 years hospitalized with pneumonia and enrolled in the multicenter Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community study between January 2010 and June 2012 were eligible. Bivariate comparisons were used to identify factors associated with bacteremia. Associations between bacteremia and clinical outcomes were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards regression for length of stay and logistic regression for ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation or shock. RESULTS: Blood cultures were obtained in 2143 (91%) of 2358 children; 46 (2.2%) had bacteremia. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 23, 50%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6, 13%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 4, 9%). Characteristics associated with bacteremia included male sex, parapneumonic effusion, lack of chest indrawing or wheezing, and no previous receipt of antibiotics. Children with bacteremia had longer lengths of stay (median: 5.8 vs 2.8 days; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.79 [0.73-0.86]) and increased odds of ICU admission (43% vs 21%; adjusted odds ratio: 5.21 [3.82-6.84]) and invasive mechanical ventilation or shock (30% vs 8%; adjusted odds ratio: 5.28 [2.41-11.57]). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia was uncommonly detected in this large multicenter cohort of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia but was associated with severe disease. S pneumoniae was detected most often. Blood culture was of low yield in general but may have greater use in those with parapneumonic effusion and ICU admission."

Influenza superinfections with GAS have been described to occur regularly and to show a severe clinical picture with high mortality. We aimed to study the extent to which influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus circulation contribute to iGAS incidence and severity. METHODS: Time-series regression models were built to explore the temporal associations between weekly laboratory counts of IAV, IBV, RSV and rhinovirus as independent variables and weekly counts of GAS disease notifications or laboratory GAS cultures as dependent variables. RESULTS: The weekly number of IAV detections showed a significant temporal association with the number of notifications of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), a severe complication of iGAS. Depending on the season, up to 40% of all notified STSS cases was attributable to IAV circulation. Besides STSS, none of the other iGAS manifestations were associated with a respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found an ecological temporal association between IAV and STSS, the most severe complication of iGAS. Future studies are needed to confirm this association and assess the possible preventability of STSS by influenza vaccination, especially in the age group 60 years and older."

Empiric therapy for CAP frequently consists of beta-lactam monotherapy or beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. However, such agents are often ineffective against S. aureus and do not reflect the emergence and increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community setting. Ceftaroline fosamil is a fifth-generation parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive pathogens - such as S. aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes - and typical Gram-negative pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The approval of ceftaroline fosamil in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe CAP was based on two phase 3 trials (FOCUS 1 and 2), which demonstrated that ceftaroline fosamil was non-inferior to ceftriaxone, a standard empiric treatment for CAP, while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. Although head-to-head trials of ceftaroline fosamil versus comparators against MRSA CAP are lacking, the effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in subpopulations of patients not covered by phase 3 trials (e.g. those with MRSA CAP or severe renal impairment) has been demonstrated in the Clinical Assessment Program and Teflaro Utilization Registry (CAPTURE) study. As ineffective empiric therapy is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality and increased costs, ceftaroline fosamil, with its extended spectrum of activity, is an attractive alternative to standard antibiotic CAP regimens."

In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events. METHODS: We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014-16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009-16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses. FINDINGS: Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0 0021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0 0080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42%) of 637 in 2016 (p&lt;0 0001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009-16 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK)-with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains-which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was nine-times higher among M1UK isolates (190 2 ng/mL [IQR 168 9-200 4]; n=10) than M1global isolates (20 9 ng/mL [0 0-27 3]; n=10; p&lt;0 0001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA. INTERPRETATION: A dominant new emm1 S pyogenes lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased S pyogenes activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 S pyogenes provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance.

METHODS: All S. pyogenes isolates causing invasive disease in pediatric patients between 2005 and 2016 were included. The emm-type and the presence of 13 exotoxin genes (speA, speB, speC, speF, speG, speH, speI, speJ, speK, speL, speM, smeZ, ssa and slo) were determined in all 93 available isolates and the Multi Locus Sequece Typing in 10% of isolates of each different emm-type. RESULTS: Overall, 103 cases of S. pyogenes invasive infections were detected: 77 in Catalonia and 26 in Gipuzkoa, being 50.5% females. The incidence rate per 100,000 children was 2.5 for Gipuzkoa and 2.6 for Catalonia, with no significant temporal trends. The median age was 30 months. The most frequent clinical presentations were: pneumonia (26.2%), bacteremia/sepsis (23.3%), septic arthritis/osteomyelitis (22.3%), cellulitis/mastoiditis (12.6%) and meningitis (6.8%). Eight children developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Nine cases were preceded by varicella infection. The associated mortality rate was 3.9%. Three isolates were resistant to erythromycin, being one of them also resistant to clindamycin and 4 isolates were resistant to levofloxacine. Forteen different emm-types were detected being emm1/ST28 (40.9%) the most frequent clone in both regions followed by emm12/ST36-ST242, emm6/ST382, emm3/ST15, emm75/ST150 and emm4/ST38-39. speA gene was only detected in emm1 and emm3 isolates.

The current study was carried out in order to investigate the possible role of pet animals in the epidemiology of such pathogen. For this purpose, nasal or oral swabs were collected from 115 pets (40 dogs and 75 cats) with respiratory illness. The collected swabs were cultured for isolation and identification of S. pyogenes. Macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes strains were initially identified after antibiotic susceptibility testing of the all obtained S. pyogenes isolates, then the phenotypic and molecular identification were done using the double-disk test and the detection of macrolide resistance genes, respectively. Of the 115 examined pet animals, S. pyogenes was recovered from 11 (9.6 %), from which, the isolation rates among dogs and cats were 15 % and 6.7 %, respectively. Macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes was isolated from dogs and cats in the following rates 10 % and 5.3 %, respectively. All macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes strains were assigned to cMLS resistance phenotype while all of them carried ermB gene only, except one strain from a cat possessed both ermB and ermTR genes. The phylogenetic analysis of 4 ermB gene sequences showed high genetic relatedness with those carried by bacteria isolated from human cases to underline the public health impact of such strains. Seriously, all macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes strains were resistant to penicillin.

The implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV13) and enhanced antimicrobial control (2013-2015) by the government may have changed the antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Four respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Moraxella catarrhalis) isolated in a single medical center during 2008-2017 were studied. We defined three temporal stages: (a) the first era (2008-2012), prior to implementation of the national immunization program (PCV13 vaccination), (b) the second era (2013-2015), during which an enhanced antibiotic control strategy was implemented, and (c) the third era (2016-2017), after implementation. Antimicrobial drug sensitivities were collected from two other hospitals: one from east Taiwan, one from west-central Taiwan. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae was frequently isolated during the first era. It declined progressively during the second era of PCV13 vaccination. S. pyogenes and M. catarrhalis were not frequently isolated. The drug susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to ceftriaxone and vancomycin remained high. The antimicrobial susceptibility of H. influenzae to amoxillin/clavulante declined over the three temporal stages, from 91.9%-79.5%-58.5% (all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance of H. influenzae increased during the latter part of the study period. The PCV13 vaccination program reduced the invasive pneumococcal disease and reduced the stress on the emergent drug resistance. This enhanced antibiotic control strategy was effective in terms of nosocomial drug resistance but not for community-associated pathogens."

The M protein (emm type) is a critical virulence factor. Several studies have shown an increased incidence of invasive S. pyogenes disease. This was associated with an increase in the prevalence of M1 and M3 types, well-recognised virulent M types. The aim of the present study was to confirm the resurgence of invasive S. pyogenes disease during 2011-2018 and to identify the relationship between specific M types with disease presentation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Isolates were confirmed using standard techniques: colony morphology, beta-haemolysis, biochemical tests, and agglutination with specific antisera (DiaMondiaL Strep Kit, DiaMondiaL, Langenhagen, Germany). The antibiotic sensitivity was performed using microdilution (Vitek 2 Compact, bioMerieux, Inc., Durham, NC). Molecular analysis included the determination of the emm gene and superantigen profile. RESULTS: A total of 29 invasive isolates were collected (2011-2018) from blood (16), pleural fluid (9), synovial fluid (3), and cerebrospinal fluid (1). One strain per year was isolated between 2011 and 2013, with 2, 5, 4, 6, and 9 strains being isolated between 2014 and 2018, respectively. The most frequent clinical presentations were bacteraemia and pneumonia (10 and 9 cases). The predominant types were M1 (11 isolates) and M3 (3 isolates). A correlation was found between M1 and M3 types, and pneumonia (6/7 cases) and deep soft tissue infections (3/3 cases).

","SPECIES:Streptococcus pyogenesID:32025929TITLE:Necrotizing fasciitis following primary peritonitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes with covS mutation in a healthy woman: a case report.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Primary peritonitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is uncommon in patients without comorbid conditions such as immunosuppression, nephritic disease, or liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, it does not cause another infection at the same time in a healthy person. However, several S. pyogenes mutants have been reported, and some of them exhibit strong virulence. Mutation of the control of virulence (cov) S gene of Streptococcus enhances bacterium survival by repressing negative regulators of virulence, which causes bacterial invasion of aseptic tissues, such as the parenteral space. We report a case of primary peritonitis and subsequent necrotizing fasciitis by the same S. pyogenes species with mutated covS in a previously healthy woman. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 55-year-old woman admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and nausea. She was treated for peritonitis. A few days later, she became hypotensive and tachycardic and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for the treatment of septic shock with primary peritonitis. On the second day of her ICU stay, both of her forearms developed swelling and redness around the peripheral injection site. The patient had developed necrotizing fasciitis. Since her skin symptoms spread rapidly, urgent debridement was performed. Her condition improved with antibiotic treatment and multiple episodes of debridement. S. pyogenes was detected in cultures of the patient's blood, ascites, and skin. The identified strain was emm89 genotype and had a genetic mutation of covS. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes with covS mutation may spread from a portal, such as the upper respiratory tract or digestive system, to all organs immediately, causing septic shock. Infection with S. pyogenes with mutated genes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal symptoms, even in a previously healthy patient."

During the seasonal increase of incidence of respiratory viral infections, the possibility of viral-bacterial co-infection is often not taken into account. AIM: Determine the incidence of GABHS in children with catarrhal symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough) and without them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 69 children with signs of acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP) in the first 2 days of the disease were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the presence or absence of rhinorrhea and cough. All patients underwent a comprehensive otorhinolaryngological examination and bacteriological examination of smears from the surface of the posterior pharyngeal wall and lacunae of the tonsils. Obtained data was processed by basic statistical methods. RESULTS: Incidence of GABHS in children with ATP without catarrhal symptoms was 9.5%, with rhinorrhea and cough - 3.7%. Median age for the detection of GABHS in patients with ATP was 5.6 years. A statistically significant symptom of GABHS-positive patients in our study was the enlargement of the anterior cervical lymph nodes; plaques on the tonsils were found only in 20% of cases. CONCLUSION: GABHS is predominant in patients with ATP without catarrhal phenomena, however, the presence of rhinorrhea and coughing in a patient does not exclude the possibility of the presence of GABHS infection, therefore, patients with ATP should undergo an objective examination for GABHS."

Vaccines against GAS are currently in development. METHODS: We estimated the incidence of healthcare visits and antibiotic prescribing for pharyngitis, sinusitis, and acute otitis media (AOM) in the United States using nationally-representative surveys of outpatient care provision, supplemented by insurance claims data. We estimated the proportion of these episodes attributable to GAS, and to GAS emm types included in a proposed 30-valent vaccine. We used these outputs to estimate the incidence of outpatient visits and antibiotic prescribing preventable by GAS vaccines with various efficacy profiles under infant and school-age dosing schedules. RESULTS: GAS pharyngitis causes 19.1 (95%CI: 17.3-21.1) outpatient visits and 10.2 (9.0-11.5) antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 US persons aged 0-64 years, annually. GAS pharyngitis causes 93.2 (82.3-105.3) visits and 53.2 (45.2-62.5) antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 children ages 3-9 years, annually, representing 5.9% (5.1-7.0%) of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in this age group. Collectively, GAS-attributable pharyngitis, sinusitis, and AOM cause 26.9 (23.9-30.8) and 16.1 (14.0-18.7) outpatient visits and antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 population, annually. A 30-valent GAS vaccine meeting the WHO 80% efficacy target could prevent 5.4% (4.6-6.4%) of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions among children aged 3-9 years. If vaccine prevention of GAS pharyngitis made routine antibiotic treatment of pharyngitis unnecessary, up to 17.1% (15.0-19.6%) of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions among children aged 3-9 years could be prevented. CONCLUSIONS: An efficacious GAS vaccine could prevent substantial incidence of pharyngitis infections and associated antibiotic prescribing in the United States."

It is associated with a substantial increase in mortality rate and can rarely result in multiorgan infarction. Early recognition plays a vital role in patients' outcome.Objective: To report a case of complicated STSS and review the literature for previous case reports of streptococcal postpartum endometritis to determine if STSS diagnostic criteria (published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were fulfilled.Case presentation: This is a 41-year-old woman who presented 5 days after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with endometritis complicated by invasive group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) infection and confirmed toxic shock syndrome. The patient was initially admitted to the critical care unit due to hemodynamic compromise requiring intravenous (IV) fluids, IV antibiotic therapy with penicillin and clindamycin, and IV immunoglobulin therapy. The patient subsequently developed multi-organ infarctions, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring noninvasive respiratory support, and severe reactive arthritis. Literature review revealed 15 case reports of GAS postpartum endometritis, five met criteria for confirmed STSS. One patient died from severe septic shock leading to cardiopulmonary arrest. Thirteen out of 15 cases of postpartum endometritis occurred after uncomplicated vaginal delivery.Conclusion: STSS is a serious and possibly fatal medical condition that requires early diagnosis and treatment to prevent poor patient outcomes and death. Careful consideration to the patient's postpartum clinical presentation with the implementation of an intradisciplinary approach should be utilized."

We described initial clinical and laboratory features and outcomes of <3-month-old infants hospitalized for an IGASI between 2007 and 2016 in France. Patients were identified from the French National Reference Centre for streptococci. IGASI was defined by the isolation of GAS from blood cultures or from other usually sterile sites. Data collection was performed by assessing the patients' hospitalization reports. Twenty-six patients (15 males; 57.7%) were included. Among 19 cases with available data, 14 (73.7%) were household contacts of a GAS infection, reaching 8/9 (88.9%) in neonates. The diagnoses were bacteremia (n = 18; 69.2%), pleural effusion or pneumonia (n = 6; 23.1%), meningitis with brain abscess (n = 1; 3.8%), and septic arthritis (n = 1; 3.8%). Fever (n = 10; 38.5%), hemodynamic disorders (n = 11; 42.3%), respiratory disorders (n = 7; 26.9%), thrombocytopenia (n = 7; 26.9%), and neutropenia (n = 5; 19.2%) were frequently observed. The main emm-genotype was emm-1 (n = 8; 30.8%). Thirteen (50.0%) infants have been admitted to the intensive care unit, and two (7.7%) died. Respiratory disorders, high C-reactive protein level, and the need for transfusion were significantly associated with severity. IGASI remains uncommon in <3-month-old children but leads to a high morbidity. Whether an antibiotic prophylaxis for contact neonates of a patient with GAS infection decreases the risk of infection remains to be determined."

We aimed to describe the patient characteristics (Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]), treatment (3-h bundle), and outcomes in relation to bacterial virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (BHS). Methods: This sepsis primary study is part of the larger Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) study, a multicenter, prospective cohort study. We included patients diagnosed with S. pneumoniae and BHS sepsis and examined virulence, defining the high-virulence factor as follows: S. pneumoniae serotype 3, 31, 11A, 35F, and 17F; Streptococcus pyogenes, emm 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, III; and Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis, emm typing pattern stG 6792. Included patients were divided into high and normal categories based on the virulence factor. Results: Of 1,184 sepsis patients enrolled in the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine's FORECAST study, 62 were included in the current study (29 cases with S. pneumoniae sepsis and 33 with BHS). The CCI and completion of a 3-h bundle did not differ between normal and high virulence groups. Risk of 28-day mortality was significantly higher for high-virulence compared to normal-virulence when adjusted for CCI and completion of a 3-h bundle (Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, hazard ratio 3.848; 95% confidence interval, 1.108-13.370; P = 0.034).

An arteriovenous fistula has an advantage because of the ability to serve as permanent access for hemodialysis over several months to years; however, it has a disadvantage because of its associated vascular and infectious complications. An infectious complication such as explosive pleuritis, which is usually due to respiratory infections, in the setting of an infected arteriovenous fistula site infection, is extremely rare. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old man with a past medical history of IgA nephropathy on hemodialysis with a left forearm arteriovenous fistula presented to the Emergency Department because of left flank pain. Despite no recent history or evidence of a respiratory tract infection, he developed explosive pleuritis within 48 h. The presence of Group A Streptococcus at the arteriovenous fistula site coincided with Streptococcus pyogenes infection. The pleural effusion was drained and he was treated with antibiotics. He recovered and was eventually discharged home. CONCLUSIONS Explosive pleuritis, although less frequent, is almost always secondary to respiratory tract infections. An arteriovenous fistula site infection may be the source of infection of an internal organ if no apparent source is identified."

Species from the anaerobic Porphyromonas genus are known to cause oral infections, but rarely cause infection of the skin. In this case report, we describe a subcutaneous abscess caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis in a 67-year-old man who had started chemotherapy for lung cancer (cT3N3M0 stage III B) three days prior to consulting a dermatologist. On clinical examination, a fist-sized mass with a hot sensation was observed in the left temporal region of the face, and treatment with cefazolin was commenced at 6 g/day. After three days, the mass was drained via skin incision and pus culture was performed, which revealed infection with P. gingivalis. The patient was successfully treated with abscess drainage and antibiotics therapy. We suggest that in tandem with immunosuppression, P. gingivalis could be a cause of skin infections."

Identification of the pathogens is crucial in the management of CAP. This study was done to determine the common bacterial pathogens, treatment outcomes and associated factors for microbiological confirmed CAP among adults attending the Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure hospital in the city of Mwanza, Tanzania. Methods: This was a hospital based cross sectional study involving patients with community acquired pneumonia attending Bugando Medical Centre and Sekou Toure regional Hospital. Demographic and other data were collected using standardized data collection tool. Sputum culture was done followed by identification of the isolates and antibiotics susceptibility testing. Results: A total of 353 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 353 sputum samples, 265(75%) were of good quality. Of 353 non-repetitive sputum cultures, 72/353 (20.4, 95% CI: 16.2-24.6) were positive for the bacterial pathogens with five patients having more than one pathogen. Good quality sputa had significantly higher yield of pathogenic bacteria than poor quality sputa (26.1% vs.3.4%, P = 0.001). The majority 64 (83.1%) of the isolates were gram negative bacteria. Common bacteria isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae 23/77(29.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 10/77 (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9/77 (11.7%) and Escherichia coli 7/77 (9.1%). Of 23 K. pneumoniae isolates, 20/23 (87.0%) were resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ceftriaxone was found to be associated with prolongation of CAP symptoms (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Gram negative bacteria resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were most frequently isolated bacteria among adults' patients with CAP attending BMC and Sekou Toure hospital. Routine sputum culture should be performed to guide appropriate treatment of CAP among adults in developing countries."

Streptococcus pyogenes is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pleuropneumonia/empyema in children, but its relative incidence is rising. METHODS: The medical records of all children 0-18 years of age from 2004 to 2019, with discharge diagnoses of pleuropneumonia or empyema, and a positive blood and/or pleural effusion culture for group A streptococcus (GAS) (S. pyogenes), or S. pneumonia (SP) were reviewed. A comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics for the 2 etiologies was performed. RESULTS: Ninety cases of community-acquired pleuropneumonia/empyema caused by these organisms were included: 20 GAS and 70 SP. Compared with children with SP, those with GAS were more likely to have larger pleural effusion requiring drainage and longer hospitalization, and less likely to have a positive blood culture. The relative portion of GAS empyema increased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients with SP empyema, GAS appears to cause more morbidity and a longer hospital stay. This organism is more frequently recovered from pleural fluid without bacteremia, and thus necessitates pleural fluid tap for accurate diagnosis."

Surveillance of resistance and emm type has important implication to provide helpful information on the changing GAS epidemiology and empirical treatment. METHODS: To study the emergence of resistant GAS in children with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), a retrospective study was conducted from 2000 to 2019 in southern Taiwan. Microbiological studies, including antibiotic susceptibility, were performed. GAS emm types and sequences were determined by molecular methods. The population was divided into two separate decades to analyze potential changes over time. The 1st decade was 2000-2009; the 2nd decade was 2010-2019. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors associated with macrolide resistance between these periods. RESULTS: A total of 320 GAS from 339 children were enrolled. Most of the children (75%) were under 9 years of age. The most common diagnosis was scarlet fever (225, 66.4%), and the frequency increased from 54.8% in the 1st to 77.9% in the 2nd decade (p < 0.0001).

This can be complicated by empyema thoracis. We present a rarer case of chronic alcoholic with splenic abscess along with empyema thoracis. PRESENTATION OF A CASE: A 39-year old alcoholic male presented with history of pain at left hypochondrium and difficulty breathing for 7 days. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness at left hypochondrium along with enlarged spleen and liver associated with decreased air entry of left chest. Chest X-ray showed complete white out lung field on left side. Contrast enhanced tomography abdomen and pelvis revealed splenic abscess involving lower pole of spleen along with peri splenic extension. Tube thoracostomy drainage on left chest was done followed by ultrasonography guided repeated aspiration of splenic entity. Pus culture sensitivity showed growth of Streptococcus pyogenes while splenic aspirate remained sterile. Patient got discharged on 8th day of admission with full recovery. DISCUSSION: Splenic abscess is the rare entity which is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals that might get complicated as empyema thoracis and management includes broad spectrum antibiotics along with tube thoracostomy and percutaneous drainage of splenic abscess if possible, in view of spleen being salvageable. Pleural collection revealed growth of Streptococcus pyogenes in our case which itself is the rare finding. CONCLUSION: Splenic abscess can be managed with percutaneous aspiration/drainage if lesion is unilocular in the view of salvaging spleen. Complicated empyema can be managed with tube thoracostomy along with broad spectrum antibiotics."

The study was undertaken to establish whether there was a true increase in severe S. pyogenes pneumonia and to explore its epidemiology and clinical features. Methods: The study was a retrospective descriptive study of S. pyogenes pneumonia set in two tertiary referral hospitals in Newcastle, a large regional city, during the period 2007 to 2018. Subjects were adults identified as having S. pyogenes pneumonia by searching a database of severe CAP (defined as requiring intensive care unit [ICU] admission) for the period 2007-2018. Laboratory records were also searched for sterile site isolates of S. pyogenes to identify patients not requiring ICU admission. Results: There were 13 cases of S. pyogenes CAP identified during the study period, of whom 12 (92%) required ICU admission. S. pyogenes accounted for 12/728 (1.6%) cases of severe CAP during the study period. The severity of S. pyogenes pneumonia was high despite a mean patient age of 48 years and 7/13 (54%) having no significant past medical history. The mortality rate was 2/13 (15%). Viral co-infection was found in 6/12 (50%) of patients tested. Overall 7/12 (58%) of the patients with severe S. pyogenes CAP during the study period presented in the winter or spring of 2017. Conclusions: Streptococcus pyogenes is a rare cause of severe CAP in the Newcastle area, but there was a marked increase in frequency observed during the 2017 influenza season.

In 2018, a voluntary mass antibiotic prophylaxis (MAP) program was implemented to interrupt GAS transmission among recruits. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of three GAS outbreaks and a period of increased pharyngitis infections at the CAF BMT facility in Quebec over a two-year span, and to detail the prevention and control measures implemented to mitigate the risk to recruit health. Methods: Descriptive data were collected on invasive and severe GAS cases along with laboratory data including genotyping of throat swabs from recruits presenting with pharyngitis. A laboratory-based acute respiratory infection surveillance system was used to aid in monitoring and decision-making. Close contacts of recruits were assessed for asymptomatic GAS carriage and MAP adverse events surveillance was conducted. Results: Three distinct GAS outbreaks occurred at the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School totaling eight invasive (iGAS) and 13 severe (sGAS) cases over two years. All iGAS/sGAS cases, apart from one instructor, were among recruits. The predominant strain in all three outbreaks was type emm6.4. A total of 11,293 recruits received MAP (penicillin G benzathine or azithromycin) between March 7, 2018 and November 18, 2019.

Thus, health care specialists primarily focus on therapy of corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a lot of effort has been undertaken to get more manpower on intensive care units. However, the number of patients with life threatening diseases other than COVID-19 like heart attacks or strokes has not changed at all. With a strong focus on COVID-19, there is a marked risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays or misdiagnoses, potentially harming those patients. In this respect, we present two of those cases with the intent to improve the medical management of ""traditional"" diseases in times of corona pandemia. Methods: We present two patients with diseases others than SARS-CoV-2. Both cases were treated in our institution, a tertiary care hospital in the Southwest of Germany. Results: One patient had a prolonged treatment on intensive care unit (ICU) because of heart failure following voluntary isolation because of fearing COVID-19 and subsequent shortage of medication. Another patient with hypothesis of COVID-19 of primary care physician because of fever and a history of skiing in a high risk region for SARS-CoV-2 was sent home for isolation. After disease progression, the patient presented in an external hospital with fever, pain in the right ear and tachypnea. Immediately, antibiotics were started at same day, but nevertheless, he developed a septic shock, leading to multi organ failure. In blood samples, bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes was found, without any signs of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Despite adequate antibiosis, the patient developed fixed pupils, brain edema and died because of massive brain edema. Conclusion: Focusing only on COVID-19 may lead to delayed diagnosis and therapy in patients with ""traditional diseases"". These two cases impressively clarify medical challenges in times of SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.

We report the first case of adult pneumonia with pneumatocele formation that is likely caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and coinfection with influenza A virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Japanese man presented with a one-week history of fever, sore throat, and arthralgia. He was referred to our university hospital for respiratory distress. He required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Bacterial culture detected S. pyogenes in the bronchoscopic aspirates, which was not detected in blood. Although a rapid influenza antigen test was negative, an influenza A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive. Therefore, he was diagnosed with coinfection of influenza A and group A streptococcus (GAS) pneumonia complicated by probable streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. A chest radiograph on admission showed diffuse patchy opacification and consolidation in the bilateral lung fields. Multiple thin-walled cysts appeared in both middle lung fields on computed tomography (CT). On the following day, the bilateral cysts had turned into a mass-like opacity. The patient died despite intensive care. An autopsy was performed. The pathology investigation revealed multiple hematomas formed by bleeding in pneumatoceles. CONCLUSIONS: There have been no previous reports of a pneumatocele complicated by S. pyogenes in an adult patient coinfected with influenza A. Further molecular investigation revealed that the S. pyogenes isolate had the sequence type of emm3."

Of the 420 respiratory tract infection cases that were treated with CEMT-PI according to a same protocol at a total of 42 institutions in Tokyo, Kanagawa-ken, Saitama-ken and Chiba-ken from February to the beginning of April 1994, 359 cases in which clinical evaluations were considered possible were selected as the subjects of the clinical study. Regarding genders of patients, slightly more females (56.3%) than males were included. Diagnoses given to these patients included laryngopharygealitis (60.7%), tonsillitis (14.2%) and acute bronchitis (13.6). Outpatients accounted for 94.4% of the subjects. 2. For the bacteriological study, a written material describing the method of collecting specimens, storage and transport in detail was distributed to the above mentioned institutions. The isolation and identification of suspected causative bacteria, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and investigation of beta-lactamase production were conducted all together. Suspected causative bacteria were detected from 238 (66.3%) out of the 359 cases. They included 85 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 76 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 20 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 17 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis. 3. Clinical efficacy rates (the ratio of those excellent+good) among those who were treated with 1 CEMT-PI tablet (194 mg, titer) twice a day was 76.5% and among those who were given 2 tablets twice a day was 87.4%. The improvement rate of the latter was higher at a significant level of P &lt; 0.05. 4. The clinical efficacies classified by suspected causative bacteria (single bacterium) were 93.3% against M.(B.) catarrhalis, 91.7% against beta-streptococci, 87.1% against H. influenzae and 78.4% against S. pneumoniae, etc. Though 7 (9.2%) of the 76 strains of S. pneumoniae were benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), the bacteriological efficacy was assessed either excellent or good in all of the 7 patients from whom PISP were detected. The clinical efficacy was assessed 100.0% in those from which a plural number of bacteria were detected. The 13 cases from which small numbers of Staphylococcus aureus was detected with other bacterium were also included in these cases."

Thirty-five of 613 patients (5.7%) had herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolated. All but 2 of the HSV isolates were found to be type 1 by immunofluorescent staining. Two HSV-positive patients also grew Group A Streptococcus, one grew M. pneumoniae and three had serum heterophile antibody tests that were positive. On physical examination 25 of the 35 HSV-positive patients had pharyngeal erythema and 14 had pharyngeal exudate. Twelve of these patients had vesicular lesions of the lips, throat or gums associated with their other symptoms. For 29 of the 35 HSV-positive students the primary diagnosis assigned was pharyngitis, for 2 the diagnosis was stomatitis and the remainder were assigned a primary diagnosis of upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, bronchitis or dental infection. Thirty-two of the 35 HSV-positive patients were treated with oral antibiotics and 7 were treated with oral or topical acyclovir. During the same 16-month period 89 (6.9%) of 1297 students presenting with sore throat were culture-positive for influenza A or B, 30 (2.3%) of 1283 were culture-positive for M. pneumoniae and 169 (2.8%) of the 6016 cultured for Group A Streptococcus were positive. Serum was tested for heterophile antibody in 2438 students, and 257 (10.5%) were positive.

The description is based on the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases, and on microbiological data. The nationwide outbreak in 1987-88, caused mainly by M-1 organisms, was followed by several years with remarkably low incidences of invasive disease. However, since late in 1992 there has again been a nationwide outbreak that reached even higher numbers of invasive cases than the one in 1988. While 106 cases of systemic group A streptococcal disease were recorded in 1988, the numbers for 1993 and 1994 were 143 and 188 respectively (population 4.3 million). No change has taken place in the laboratory-based notification system that could explain the observed phenomena. Previously seldom observed clinical manifestations, such as fulminant septicaemia, necrotising fasciitis and pneumonia with empyema, were again recorded; as during the 1988 outbreak."

S. salivarius strains were isolated from Malaysian subjects showing variable antimicrobial activity, metabolic profile, antibiotic susceptibility and lantibiotic production. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we report new S. salivarius strains isolated from Malaysian subjects with potential as probiotics. Safety assessment of these strains included their antibiotic susceptibility and metabolic profiles. Genome sequencing using Illumina's MiSeq system was performed for both strains NU10 and YU10 and demonstrating the absence of any known streptococcal virulence determinants indicating that these strains are safe for subsequent use as probiotics. Strain NU10 was found to harbour genes encoding salivaricins A and 9 while strain YU10 was shown to harbour genes encoding salivaricins A3, G32, streptin and slnA1 lantibiotic-like protein. Strain GT2 was shown to harbour genes encoding a large non-lantibiotic bacteriocin (salivaricin-MPS). A new medium for maximum biomass production buffered with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) was developed and showed better biomass accumulation compared with other commercial media. Furthermore, we extracted and purified salivaricin 9 (by strain NU10) and salivaricin G32 (by strain YU10) from S. salivarius cells grown aerobically in this medium. In addition to bacteriocin production, S. salivarius strains produced levan-sucrase which was detected by a specific ESI-LC-MS/MS method which indicates additional health benefits from the developed strains. CONCLUSION: The current study established the bacteriocin, levan-sucrase production and basic safety features of S. salivarius strains isolated from healthy Malaysian subjects demonstrating their potential for use as probiotics. A new bacteriocin-production medium was developed with potential scale up application for pharmaceuticals and probiotics from S. salivarius generating different lantibiotics.

More than 80% of children under three years of age experience at least one episode, and about one-third of these report significant recurrence of episodes. In recent years, several studies reported that normal nasopharyngeal flora inhibits growth of common otopathogens, suggesting that maintenance of an ""adequate"" nasopharyngeal flora might prevent occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections, including AOM. This study aims to determine whether five-month treatment with Streptococcus salivarius 24SMB and Streptococcus oralis 89a nasal spray prevents recurrence of AOM and prescription of antibiotics in children with diagnosis of recurrent AOM. METHODS: Observational prospective cohort study including children aged 1-6 years with diagnosis of recurrent AOM registered with 31 Italian family pediatricians. 81 children were enrolled in the study from September 2016 to the end of the five therapeutic cycles of the Streptococcus salivarius 24SMB and Streptococcus oralis 89a supplied 7 days each month for 5 consecutive months. For each treated child, one untreated control was randomly selected, 1:1 matched for gender, age, and follow-up. RESULTS: 158 children (79 treated and 70 untreated) were included into the analysis (mean age, 3.9 years; 47% female). Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant 34% (95% CI 1%-56%) reduction in number of AOM episodes in treated children compared with those not treated. Significantly fewer antibiotics were dispensed among treated children (24%, 95% CI 1%-41%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intermittent treatment of children with diagnosis of recurrent AOM with nasal spray containing Streptococcus salivarius 24SMB and Streptococcus oralis 89a for a period of five months might be effective in preventing antibiotic use associated with recurrent episodes of AOM. Additional larger studies to address this important clinical problem are recommended."

They concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. These patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). Seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. During 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. In six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). Most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten Streptococcus mitis, five S. oralis, two S. sanguis, three S. pneumoniae). A single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The enterococci were one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium. Ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L of penicillin G, ten were less susceptible (0.5 &lt; or = MIC &lt; 32 mg/L), and a strain was resistant (MIC = 32 mg/L). Eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. For three strains, the MICs of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/L and 8-32 mg/L, respectively) were higher. Levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. All species were susceptible to glycopeptides. Three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. Their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. This results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients."

These signs and symptoms may occur in any order, and not all are necessary for the diagnosis. Although most common in 4- to 7-year-olds, HSP is well documented in adults and is often preceded by a history of mucosal-based infections, especially of the upper respiratory tract. We report a case of HSP that occurred coincident with the onset of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) in an otherwise healtny 41-year-old white woman. The patient presented with a purpuric rash and arthralgia and was found to have left-sided streptococcal SBE. She subsequently developed abdominal pain and immune complex glomerulonephritis. The bacterial endocarditis was treated with antibiotics and mitral valve replacement, followed by a spontaneous resolution of the associated signs and symptoms of HSP."

The incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by Streptococcus angionosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (A, B, C, and G). Twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. One-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. Forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microL). Only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. Twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. Five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome. The source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. No unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one S. mitis and one E. faecium. No relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the NRL from different regions of the Czech Republic. Generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the Quellung reaction. Since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay has been introduced. The novel assay was tested on 210 S. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species S. pseudopneumoniae, S. sanguinis, and S. oralis. RESULTS: The NRL for Streptococcal Infections has included a novel mPCR assay in the algorithm of S. pneumoniae identification and typing. The mPCR assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the isolates of the related species remaining negative. The mPCR assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. The pCR appeared to be an excellent tool for S. pneumoniae typing. CONCLUSION: Until recently, S. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (Quellung reaction), but the NRL for Streptococcal Infections has switched to a novel mPCR assay. This molecular tool improves S. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate."

Particularly, there are no guidelines for the management of this complication. We describe a rare case of pulmonary embolism and infarction followed by a haemothorax due to infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve caused by Streptococcus sanguinis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old man with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) presented with fever. On physical examination, his body temperature was 38.8  C, and a grade III holosystolic murmur was heard. A chest X-ray did not reveal any specific findings. A transoesophageal echocardiogram showed a perimembranous VSD and echogenic material attached to the tricuspid valve. All blood samples drawn from three different sites yielded growth of pan-susceptible S. sanguinis in culture bottles. On day 12 of hospitalization, the patient complained of pleuritic chest pain without fever. Physical examination revealed reduced breathing sounds and dullness in the lower left thorax. On his chest computed tomography scan, pleural effusion with focal infarction and pulmonary embolism were noted on the left lower lung. Thoracentesis indicated the presence of a haemothorax. INTERVENTION: Our case was successfully treated using antibiotic therapy alone with adjunctive chest tube insertion, rather than with anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism or cardiac surgery. CONCLUSION: When treating infective endocarditis caused by S. sanguinis, clinicians should include haemothorax in the differential diagnosis of patients complaining of sudden chest pain."

They are responsible for 40-60% of the endocarditis cases occurring on the normal valves, especially in male patients and over 45 years of age. A change in the bacterial flora of the oral cavity is taking part after orthodontic fixed appliances are introduced into the oral cavity, change that is associated with an increased concentration of the acidogenic bacteria. Bacteraemia is the consequence of oral cavity infections, the association of infective endocarditis with fixed orthodontic appliance, as it has been described by us for the first time, caused by Abiotrophia defectiva. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female Caucasian patient, aged 22 years, who developed infective endocarditis with Streptococcus viridans associated with fixed orthodontic appliance, located on the mitral valve, without previous cardiac pathology, and the therapeutic difficulties associated with allergic reactions (to vancomycin, and spironolactone). DIAGNOSES: Repetitive haemocultures were positive with Streptococcus viridans, while transthoracic echography revealed a severe mitral failure through anteromedial segment of the anterior mitral valve leaf prolapse with eccentric jet to the posterior wall. INTERVENTIONS: During hospitalization, the decision to undergo surgical intervention was taken after obtaining negative haemocultures. The patient underwent surgically intervention, and a mitral valve plasty with insertion of neochords was performed. OUTCOMES: Intraoperative and subsequently post-discharge transesophageal echography, highlighted normofunctional mitral plasty with a remaining regurgitation grade I-II of IV, with good openness, minor tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. LESSONS: Endocarditis with oral streptococci associated with fixed orthodontic appliance seems to be not so unlikely even in young or without previous cardiac pathology patients, requiring attention in identifying possible pre-existing cardiac conditions like mitral valve prolapse with clinical and echographic monitoring of such cases. Educating and motivating the patient to observe the oral hygiene represent key steps for an optimal oral health during orthodontic treatment. Mechanical tooth cleaning helps maintaining a good oral hygiene during fixed orthodontics and decreasing the oral health risks."

Infections associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody therapy include tuberculosis, viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Likewise, severe infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, lung, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, joint, and bone have also been reported previously. However, infections involving the central nervous system are rare, especially an intracranial infection caused by odontogenic infection. To date, only few cases have been reported of this infection. This is the first case of a patient with psoriatic arthritis receiving adalimumab and developing brain abscess of odontogenic origin. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old male with psoriatic arthritis receiving adalimumab treatment came to the emergency department with initial presentation of sudden onset convulsions. He had been receiving adalimumab treatment for 1 month. Two days after the third injection, the patient had an episode of sudden-onset general convulsion for nearly 5 min with the upgazing and general tonic presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed left frontal lobe brain abscess. Pus culture from the brain abscess detected Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), and Parvimonas micra (P. micra). DIAGNOSIS: Brain abscess with odontogenic infection. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received left frontal craniotomy, abscess drainage and systemic empiric antibiotics treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Due to drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms during the treatment, vancomycin and metronidazole were discontinued, and systemic antibiotics were switched to teicoplanin and ceftriaxone. OUTCOMES: A brain MRI follow-up performed after 1 month of initial treatment revealed the reduced size of the abscess lesion and minimal oedema. The patient was discharged with stable condition. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with psoriatic arthritis receiving adalimumab and developing brain abscess of odontogenic origin. Such a rare diagnosis must be kept in mind when patients treated with adalimumab present with sudden-onset convulsions. Careful dental examination should be performed before administration of adalimumab."

The bacteremia may have contributed to the two deaths among these 13 patients. In 45 cases the viridans streptococci may have contributed to the patient's illness: 15 patients had an infection of the lower respiratory tract and 7 an infection of the upper respiratory tract, 8 were neonates with suspected septicemia, 3 had soft tissue infections, 3 had leukemia and sepsis, and 9 had miscellaneous infections; the bacteremia was unrelated to the two deaths in this group. In another 13 cases the viridans streptococci could not be related to the patient's illness. The species most frequently isolated were Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius. The outcome of the bacteremia was generally good, even among the 11 patients not treated with antibiotics. When viridans streptococci are cultured from a single blood sample, further samples of blood and, if feasible, specimens from the associated focus of infection should be obtained for culture; further blood cultures are especially important in cases of suspected endocarditis."

More recently, however, these bacteria have become a major concern in neutropenic patients undergoing a chemotherapeutic treatment. In this high-risk population, they can be responsible for up to 39% of bacteremia cases and are the most frequent cause of this type of infection. The most frequently isolated species in blood cultures are Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II. Viridans streptococcus bacteremia can be accompanied by serious complications, like adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3% to 33%), shock (7% to 18%) or endocarditis (7% to 8%). Mortality rates range from 6% to 30%. Case-control studies have identified the following risk factors: severe neutropenia (&lt; 100 neutrophils/mm3), prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolone or co-trimoxazole, absence of intravenous antibiotics at the time of bacteremia, high doses of cytosine arabinoside, oropharyngeal mucositis, and heavy colonization by viridans streptococci. The introduction of penicillin in prophylactic antibiotic treatments has reduced the incidence of these infections, but the long-term use of penicillin could be compromised by the emergence of resistant strains."

All infants had had intracardiac central lines inserted to facilitate venous access, either by a percutaneous technique or as a formal surgical procedure. Eight (67%) were successfully treated and made a full recovery. Cardiac murmurs were absent in all of the cases. Echocardiography should be included in the investigation of all neonates with persistently positive blood culture, particularly when intracardiac lines have been sited.

A total of 76 strains of viridans streptococci were isolated, of which the most common isolates were Streptococcus constellatus (21 strains), S. intermedius (17), and S. sanguis (10). Species belonging to the S. milleri group accounted for the majority (68%) of isolates. In 38 (53%) patients these organisms were recognized as the sole pathogens. Of the 72 patients, 53 had empyema, 14 had lung abscesses, and five had both empyema and lung abscess. Forty-six (64%) patients had underlying diseases. Of these, malignancies were the most common (17 patients), followed by diabetes mellitus (12 patients) and central nervous system diseases (10 patients). Of the 48 patients who underwent chest-tube drainage, 27 (56%) received further treatments, including intrapleural streptokinase (18 cases), surgery (9), and both intrapleural streptokinase and surgery (3). Two (14%) of the patients with lung abscess alone underwent surgical treatment. Although all viridans streptococcal isolates were susceptible to penicillin, the patients in the study had a high mortality (21%). Univariate and multivariate analysis of data for patients with empyema alone (n = 53) showed a significantly increased risk of death in those with underlying malignancy (OR = 16.0, p = 0.023) and those with non-S. milleri-group isolates (OR = 3.72, p = 0.030).

However, an accidental case happened in Sichuan province of China in 2005. Some people got ill and died, and all of them were closely contacted with sick pigs. Based on clinical features and epidemiologic data, this case could be caused by SS2 infection. Liver, spleen, kidney, lung and serum samples were collected and used for pathogen isolation and identification in laboratory, three strain bacteria were isolated. The three strains of SS2 showed typical morphology of SS2 on blood agar and under microscope with Gram stain. They were also agglutinated with standard serum of SS2. Biochemical characteristics of the three bacteria were tested using API 20 strep and analyzed by API software (version 3.3), results showed they were SS2. Four pairs of primer were designed, which were exactly matched the extracellular factor gene, muraminidase released protein gene, capsular polysaccharides gene and 16S rRNA gene respectively.

In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds. Even the 'well-known' reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively). Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease. Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control. A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety.

S. suis causes meningitis, sepsis, and endocarditis in both pigs and humans and involves significant mortality. We report the case of a previously healthy 50-year-old dairy farmer who developed S. suis type 2 endocarditis complicated by pulmonary embolism and spondylitis. He experienced a high fever, chills, fatigue, and worsening low back pain in the 6 weeks prior to admission. On physical examination, he had lumbar spine tenderness and weakness of the left leg. Blood culture identified penicillin-sensitive S. suis type 2. Echocardiography showed vegetation on the tricuspid valve, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs of spondylitis. The man reported sudden chest pain several days after admission, which computed tomography (CT) showed what was diagnosed as a septic pulmonary embolism. He was treated with penicillin G for 4 weeks and gentamicin for the first 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of oral amoxicillin, after which his symptoms gradually improved. The infection source was probably his dairy herd, since calves often bit his fingers while feeding and S. suis was found in their oral mucus. Over 400 cases of human S. suis infection have been reported globally, but this is, to our knowledge, the first known case of bovine transmission. All of Japan's 8 other cases involved occupational swine exposure, 5 of whom had injuries to their fingers. This emerging situation should be made known to all possibly involved in unprotected direct contact with swine and cattle, particularly when the skin could be compromised by cuts or abrasions."

In samples collected during the porcine high fever syndrome (PHFS) outbreak in many parts of China, PRRSV and S. suis serotype 7 (SS7) have always been isolated together. To determine whether PRRSV-SS7 coinfection was the cause of the PHFS outbreak, we evaluated the pathogenicity of PRRSV and/or SS7 in a pig model of single and mixed infection. RESULTS: Respiratory disease, diarrhea, and anorexia were observed in all infected pigs. Signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease were observed in the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV)-infected pigs (4/12) and the coinfected pigs (8/10); however, the symptoms of the coinfected pigs were clearly more severe than those of the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the coinfected pigs (8/10) than in the HP-PRRSV- (2/12) and SS7-infected pigs (0/10). The deceased pigs of the coinfected group had symptoms typical of PHFS, such as high fever, anorexia, and red coloration of the ears and the body. The isolation rates of HP-PRRSV and SS7 were higher and the lesion severity was greater in the coinfected pigs than in monoinfected pigs. CONCLUSION: HP-PRRSV infection increased susceptibility to SS7 infection, and coinfection of HP-PRRSV with SS7 significantly increased the pathogenicity of SS7 to pigs."

We set up a laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system to elucidate bacterial etiologic spectrum and detect infection by rare etiologies (or serogroups) for five core syndromes in the given study area. METHODS: Patients presenting with one of five core syndromes at nine sentinel hospitals in Guagnxi, China were evaluated using laboratory-based syndrome surveillance to elucidate bacterial etiologies. We collected respiratory and stool specimens, as well as CSF, blood and other related samples for bacterial cultures and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) assays. RESULTS: From February 2009 to December 2011, 2,964 patients were enrolled in the study. Etiologies were identified in 320 (10.08%) patients. Streptococcus pneumonia (37 strains, 24.18%), Klebsiella pneumonia (34, 22.22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19, 12.42%) and Haemophilus influenza (18, 11.76%) were the most frequent pathogens for fever and respiratory syndrome, while Salmonella (77, 81.05%) was most often seen in diarrhea syndrome cases. Salmonella paratyphi A (38, 86.36%) occurred in fever and rash syndrome, with Cryptococcus neoformans (20, 35.09%), Streptococcus pneumonia (5, 8.77%), Klebsiella pneumonia (5, 8.77%),streptococcus suis (3, 5.26%) and Neisseria meningitides group B (2, 3.51%) being the most frequently detected in encephalitis-meningitis syndrome. To date no pathogen was isolated from the specimens from fever and hemorrhage patients. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to common bacterial pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and fungal infections require more attention. Our study contributes to the strengthening of the existing national surveillance system and provides references for other regions that are similar to the study area."

","SPECIES:Streptococcus suisID:29284248TITLE:Streptococcus suis: a re-emerging pathogen associated with occupational exposure to pigs or pork products. Part I - Epidemiology.ABSTRACT:&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus suis&lt;/i&gt; (ex Elliot 1966, Kilpper-Balz &amp; Schleifer 1987) is a facultatively anaerobic Gram-positive ovoid or coccal bacterium surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule. Based on the antigenic diversity of the capsule, &lt;i&gt;S. suis&lt;/i&gt; strains are classified serologically into 35 serotypes. &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus suis&lt;/i&gt; is a commensal of pigs, commonly colonizing their tonsils and nasal cavities, mostly in weaning piglets between 4-10 weeks of age. This species occurs also in cattle and other mammals, in birds and in humans. Some strains, mostly those belonging to serotype 2, are also pathogenic for pigs, as well as for other animals and humans. Meningitis is the primary disease syndrome caused by &lt;i&gt;S. suis&lt;/i&gt;, both in pigs and in humans. It is estimated that meningitis accounted for 68.0% of all cases of human disease reported until the end of 2012, followed by septicaemia (including life-threatening condition described as 'streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome' - STSLS), arthritis, endocarditis, and endophthalmitis. Hearing loss and/or ves tibular dysfunction are the most common sequelae after recovery from meningitis caused by &lt;i&gt;S. suis&lt;/i&gt;, occurring in more than 50% of patients. In the last two decades, the number of reported human cases due to &lt;i&gt;S. suis&lt;/i&gt; has dramatically increased, mostly due to epidemics recorded in China in 1998 and 2005, and the fulminant increase in morbidity in the countries of south-eastern Asia, mostly Vietnam and Thailand. Out of 1,642 cases of &lt;i&gt;S. suis&lt;/i&gt; infections identified between 2002-2013 worldwide in humans, 90.2% occurred in Asia, 8.5% in Europe and 1.3% in other parts of the globe. The human disease has mostly a zoonotic and occupational origin and occurs in pig breeders, abattoir workers, butchers and workers of meat processing facilities, veterinarians and meat inspectors. Bacteria are transmitted to workers by close contact with pigs or pig products, usually through contamination of minor cuts or abrasions on skin of hands and/or arms, or by pig bite. A different epidemiologic situation occurs in the Southeast Asian countries where most people become infected by habitual consumption of raw or undercooked pork, blood and offal products in the form of traditional dishes. Prevention of &lt;i&gt;S. suis&lt;/i&gt; infections in pigs includes vaccination, improvement in pig-raising conditions, disinfection and/or fumigation of animal houses, and isolation of sick animals at the outbreak of disease. Prevention of human infections comprises: protection of skin from pig bite or injury with sharp tools by people occupationally exposed to pigs and pig products, prompt disinfection and dressing of wounds and abrasions at work, protection of the respiratory tract by wearing appropriate masks or repirators, consulting a doctor in the case of febrile illness after exposure to pigs or pork meat, avoidance of occupations associated with exposure to pigs and pork by immunocompomised people, avoidance of consumption of raw pork or pig blood, adequate cooking of pork, and health education."

Case report].ABSTRACT:The authors describe the case of purulent meningitis of a male patient who has been diagnosed with the role of Streptococcus suis in the background of the infection. The bacterium is a colonizing agent in the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal tract, and genital organs of various animals (pigs, ruminants, cats, dogs, deer and horses). The pathogen is predominantly animal pathogenic, but human cases also occur with zoonotic origin. The disease occurs primarily in sepsis, meningitis, in both animal and human cases. The prevalence of the disease is very diverse in the continents, the highest is in Asia. There is a difference between the Asian and the European and American regions, which is affected by cultural and eating habits. The appearance of bacteria in our country is primarily due to an occupational disease, but also imported cases may occur, due to the emerging tourism. For the precise microbiological diagnosis of the pathogen, the existence of modern identification methods is indispensable. The authors want to draw attention to this bacterium that causes serious infections, so it is important to summarize and disclose the knowledge available in the literature.

In Sweden, S. suis has previously received little attention but has in recent years become increasingly recognized as affecting the pig production. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence, serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. suis in Swedish grower pigs from herds with and without reported S. suis associated disease, as well as possible associations between S. suis associated disease and selected environmental and production factors. Swab samples were taken from the tonsils of clinically healthy 8-13-week-old grower pigs from ten case herds and ten control herds. Isolates were cultured, identified using MALDI-TOF MS, and serotyped using latex agglutination. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 188 isolates was tested using broth microdilution. Production data was gathered and environmental parameters were measured on the farms. RESULTS: Streptococcus suis was isolated from 95% of the sampled pigs in both the case and the control herds. Serotypes 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, and 17-34 were detected, although a majority of the isolates (81.5%) were non-typeable. There was less diversity among the serotypes isolated from the case herds than among those from the control herds; four and nine different serotypes, respectively. Isolates resistant to penicillin (3.8%) were reported for the first time in Sweden. Tetracycline resistance was common (88.4%). No association was noted between the production and the environmental factors investigated, and the carriership of S. suis. CONCLUSIONS: The carriership of S. suis was found to be higher in clinically healthy Swedish pigs than previously estimated, and for the first time, the presence of Swedish isolates resistant to penicillin was reported. Many of the most commonly disease-associated serotypes, e.g. serotypes 2, 9, 3, and 7, were detected in healthy grower pigs although further studies are needed to investigate the virulence of these isolates."

It is mainly known for causing polyserositis and polyarthritis in weaned piglets, even though the mechanisms of systemic spread are not fully understood. Mycoplasma hyorhinis has also been associated with other diseases in pigs such as pneumonia or otitis media, but so far has not been known to cause central nervous disorders. This case series reports the isolation of Mycoplasma hyorhinis from cerebrospinal fluid and/ or meningeal swabs from piglets originating from four different piglet producing farms in Austria. CASE PRESENTATION: On farm 1, coughing, stiff movement and central nervous signs occurred in nursery piglets. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was the only pathogen isolated from meningeal swabs from two piglets showing central nervous signs. Fibrinopurulent leptomeningitis was only observed in one piglet. Only one of two nursery piglets from farm 2 showed mild central nervous signs but no histologic lesions; Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of the piglet with neurologic signs. Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of all three investigated piglets from farm 3, all of which showed central nervous signs and purulent leptomeningitis. Further, Streptococcus suis was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of one piglet. Fibrinopurulent leptomeningitis was detected in two piglets from farm 4 that had died overnight without showing any clinical signs and Mycoplasma hyorhinis was isolated from meningeal swabs from both piglets. CONCLUSION: While causality has yet to be proven by experimental infection and in situ detection of the pathogen in histologic sections, the findings of this study and the absence of other pathogens suggest Mycoplasma hyorhinis as a potential causative agent of meningitis in swine."

The most frequently occurring streptococcus was S. subacidus (bio) type II which was isolated in 31.2% of the cases. S. suis type 2 (Serogroup R) and S. equisimilis (Serogroup C) constituted 16.2% and 13.7% of the isolates respectively.

The biochemical profiles of the various S. suis and S. subacidus (bio) types are presented. The profile of both species is almost identical. It seems justified to use the name S. suis for strains with this characteristic profile and to abandon the name S. subacidus. Haemolysis does not appear to be a suitable characteristic to screen for S. subacidus/S. suis types. In comparing three serological methods for typing S. suis type 2, gel precipitation using Fuller's extract and slide agglutination give an almost 100% correlation.

Infected pigs generally had clinical signs and gross lesions referable to either the respiratory system or to the central nervous system (CNS), but not both. Neurologic signs were inversely related to gross lesions in the respiratory tract (R2 = -0.19, P = 0.003), as were respiratory signs and gross lesions in the CNS (R2 = -0.19, P = 0.003).

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 21 horses. RESULTS: 19 of the 21 horses were Thoroughbred racehorses in training. Eighteen horses had had strenuous exercise immediately prior to onset of illness. Fifteen horses had a serosanguineous nasal discharge during hospitalization. Seventeen horses had radiographic evidence of pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusion. Nine of 14 horses had ultrasonographic evidence of large pulmonary parenchymal defects consistent with consolidation. Pleurocentesis yielded a suppurative, serosanguineous effusion in the 14 horses in which it was performed. Bacteria were isolated from all transtracheal aspirates (14) and from 6 of 12 pleural fluid samples. Actinobacillus suis-like organisms and Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus were most commonly isolated. Nineteen horses were hospitalized and treated. Mean duration of treatment was 5 days, and most horses were euthanatized because of secondary complications, continued costs of medical treatment, or poor prognosis for future performance. Pathologic lesions included well-demarcated regions of hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction with necrosis and a serosanguineous pleural effusion. Thrombosis of pulmonary vessels was found in 11 horses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An acute or peracute onset of severe respiratory distress, with serosanguineous nasal discharge, ultrasonographic and radiographic evidence of severe pulmonary consolidation, and serosanguineous suppurative pleural effusion, is strongly suggestive of pulmonary infarction in horses. Horses with pulmonary infarction responded poorly to conventional treatment for pleuropneumonia and had a poor prognosis for recovery."

We examined the clinical features and significance of pathogenic microbes isolated from sputum in patients with lung cancer complicated by pneumonia. Many investigators have noted that patients with squamous cell lung cancer tend to contract pneumonia more readily than patients with cancers of other histopathological types. Our review, however, disclosed no significant differences among histopathological types. Bacteriological examinations of sputum revealed the frequent involvement of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and various gram-negative organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species) that are known to be causative agents of hospital-acquired infection. Beta-lactam and CLDM were less effective. Carbapenem used alone as the second regimen of treatment for lung cancer patients with pneumonia was found to be as effective as combination therapy with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside. However, more detailed investigations (e.g., randomized prospective studies) will be needed to identify suitable antibiotics against pneumonia in patients with lung cancer.

Despite increasing knowledge about resistance transmission patterns and new antibiotics, these organisms continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the health care setting. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus poses major problems worldwide as a cause of nosocomial infection and has emerged as a cause of community-acquired infections. This change in epidemiology affects choices of empirical antibiotics for skin and skin-structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia in many settings. Throughout the world, the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been complicated by resistance to beta-lactam and macrolide antibacterial drugs. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are a major cause of infection in the hospital setting and remain resistant to treatment with most standard antibiotics. Treatment of diseases caused by resistant gram-positive bacteria requires appropriate use of available antibiotics and stewardship to prolong their effectiveness. In addition, appropriate and aggressive infection control efforts are vital to help prevent the spread of resistant pathogens."

DESIGN: A prospective, cohort, screening study. The period of surveillance was 3 months in the winter of 2006-2007. SETTING: A freestanding academic and community rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 540 consecutive patients admitted to a freestanding rehabilitation hospital. METHODS: All of the patients were screened for MRSA and VRE upon admission to the hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of new patients identified with either MRSA or VRE colonization. RESULTS: A total of 540 patients were screened, of whom 42 (7.8%) had pre-existing MRSA status, 8 (1.5%) had pre-existing VRE status, and 10 (1.9%) had a history of positive results for both MRSA and VRE. Of the 480 patients without pre-existing positive cultures, admission swabs were positive for MRSA in 37 patients (7.7%), swabs were positive for VRE in 33 patients (6.9%), and swabs for both MRSA and VRE were newly positive for 7 patients (1.5%). Therefore 16% of the patients without a history of MRSA or VRE had a new finding of MRSA or VRE. Regression analysis revealed that prior bacteremia was a risk factor for MRSA; diabetes mellitus and a history of pneumonia and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use were risk factors for VRE. CONCLUSION: We found a 16% incidence of a hidden reservoir of multiple drug-resistant organisms in patients admitted to rehabilitation hospitals. We believe that all patients admitted to a rehabilitation facility should be screened for MRSA and VRE."

Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens. SUMMARY: VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity."

Ochroconis gallopavum is a neurotropic dematiaceous mold responsible for life-threatening respiratory and central nervous system infections in domestic poultry and in immunologically compromised humans. The world literature describes only 13 previous O gallopavum infections in solid organ transplant recipients. We report herein an O gallopavum phaeohyphomycosis with involvement of skin in a transplant recipient. A 69-year-old white man with a history of bilateral lung transplantation 6 years ago presented with acute onset of severe respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia. Lung function showed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Excision biopsy was performed because of a suspected pigmented basal cell carcinoma. Histopathology revealed dermal granulomatous dermatitis, focally suppurative, dominated by epitheloid cells with brownish round fungi. Further microbiological work-up of the biopsy specimen subsequently revealed O gallopavum as the causative organism. No brain involvement was observed. Antimycotic therapy with voriconazole 200 mg twice a day was immediately initiated and the patient was treated for 3 months. Additional intravenous therapy with tobramycin and imipenem was started upon detection of Enterobacter clocae and Enterococci in the sputum. The patient recovered during the next few weeks and was discharged on day 26."

","SPECIES:TetragenococcusID:23577494TITLE:Emerging issues in the diagnosis and management of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive cocci.ABSTRACT:BACKGROUND: Rising rates of multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive cocci (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. [VRE]) have created treatment challenges for clinicians in both the hospital and community settings. These organisms have become especially problematic for hospitalized patients with pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs). METHODS: A review of the recent literature (1990 onwards) was undertaken in order to review the epidemiology, diagnostic issues, and clinical trial data of available and forthcoming therapies for the treatment of multi-drug resistant, gram-positive isolates, with an emphasis on selected MRSA infections (i.e., pneumonia, SSSI, diabetic foot infections, blood stream) and infections caused by VRE. RESULTS: The rate of healthcare-associated MRSA in 2004 rose to an incidence of 59.5% in the United States compared with data from 1998-2002, making MRSA the predominant gram-positive etiology of S. aureus infections in hospitalized patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus has also emerged as an important pathogen in both the non-ICU and community settings. Similarly, 28.5% of all enterococcal isolates were identified as vancomycin-resistant in 2003 (a 12% increase). However, these rates may be underestimated, as detection methods for determining susceptibility have proved to be inadequate. Recognition that prior inadequate antibiotic therapy is common in patients with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and is associated with higher mortality rates, emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate empiric therapy. Currently available therapies for resistant gram-positive infections include quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, although each of these agents has limitations (e.g., daptomycin is not indicated for MRSA pneumonia due to inadequate lung tissue penetration and inactivation by surfactant). Three agents with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive organisms that are at an advanced stage of testing include two new glycopeptides (oritavancin and dalbavancin), and a first-in-class glycylcycline (tigecycline). These agents have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of SSSIs, including those caused by MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: New antimicrobial agents are needed to combat the increasing prevalence of multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA. The emergence of resistance to available therapies such as vancomycin underscores this urgency."

However, the colonization characteristics of Enterococcus with LZD resistance in patients remain elusive. Here, we report the case of a patient with recurrent pneumonia due to infection with LZD-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strains. The colonization characteristics of the strains isolated from this patient were analyzed. METHODS: Ten E. faecalis strains were isolated from tracheal secretions obtained from the patient during five recurrences of pneumonia over the course of 10 months. Clonal relationships were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI-macrorestricted genomic DNA. The susceptibility of the isolates to LZD was determined by Etest in Mueller-Hinton agar. RESULTS: The homology of these strains was demonstrated by PFGE, suggesting that occult bacterial colonization by LZD-resistant E. faecalis is possible as late as a year after exposure to LZD. These strains showed variable MICs as determined by the Etest. LZD-resistant isolates contained single or double nucleotide mutations in domain V of 23S rRNA as confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The sensitivity of the strains to vancomycin was demonstrated by broth macrodilution, and vancomycin was an effective clinical treatment on each occasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LZD-resistant E. faecalis strains may colonize persistently in vivo, leading to recurrent infection."

METHODS: A total of 3849 Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus strains were isolated from Southern China during 2001-2015. Bacteria identification was performed by colony morphology, Gram staining, the API commercial kit and the Vitek 2 automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by disk diffusion method and MIC method. RESULTS: As sampling site was concerned, 51.4% of Staphylococcus strains were isolated from sputum, whereas urinary tract remained the dominant infection site among Enterococcus and Streptococcus. According to the antimicrobial susceptibility, three genus of important Gram-positive pathogens showed high resistance against erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. Resistance rates to penicillins (penicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin) were high as well, with the exception of E. faecalis and Streptococcus. Overall, resistance rates against methicillin (oxacillin) were 63.2% in S. aureus and 76.2% in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), along with continuous increases during the study. VRSA and vancomycin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus only appeared in 2011-2015. Sight decline was obtained for the vancomycin resistance of E. faecalis, while vancomycin-resistant E. faecium only appeared in 2011-2015, with its intermediate rate decreasing. Significant decrease in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (PRSP) was observed during studied period. Glycopeptide antibiotic remained highly effective to Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus (resistance rates &lt;5%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite decline obtained for some antibiotic agents resistance during 2001-2015, antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens still remained high in Southern China.

Only a few studies are available from India addressing the microbiological aspects of VAP, which have been done with small study populations. This study was carried out in the intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital to assess the profile of pathogens and to determine the pattern of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of clinically suspected cases of VAP. Over a three year period, a total of 247 cases in 2011, 297 in 2012 and 303 in 2013 admitted in ICUs on mechanical ventilation with clinical evidence of VAP were included in our study. The endotracheal aspirate samples from these suspected cases were subjected to quantitative culture technique, and colony count of &gt;=10[5] colony forming units/ml was considered significant. Antimicrobial susceptibility test for the isolates was done. RESULTS: VAP rates of 44.1, 43.8 and 26.3 were seen in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In all the three years, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were the predominant organisms, followed by Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella spp. Staphylococcus aureus exhibited a downwards trend in prevalence from 50.0 per cent in 2011 to 34.9 per cent in 2013. An increase in vancomycin-resistant enterococci was seen from 4.3 per cent in 2012 to 8.3 per cent in 2013, while methicillin resistance amongst the S. aureus crossed the 50 per cent mark in 2013. An increasing trend in resistance was shown by Pseudomonas spp. for piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ), amikacin and imipenem (IPM). For the non-fermenters, resistance frequency remained very high except for IPM (33.1%) and polymyxin-B (2.4%). INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show VAP as an important problem in the ICU setting. The incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens was on the rise. The resistance pattern of these pathogens can help an institution to formulate effective antimicrobial policy. To have a comprehensive pan-India picture, multicentric studies are needed."

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and etiological agents of HAI in a Surgical ICU in Kazakhstan, and to assess the impact of these infections on ICU stay and mortality. Objective: To assess the rate of device-associated infections and causative HAI etiological agents in an ICU at the National Research Center for Oncology and Transplantation (NRCOT) in Astana, Kazakhstan. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a 12-bed ICU at the NRCOT, Astana, Kazakhstan. We enrolled all patients who were admitted to the ICU from January, 2014 through November 2015, aged 18 to 90 years of age who developed an HAI. Results: The most common type of HAI was surgical site infection (SSI), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related blood stream infection (BSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI). The most common HAI was SSI with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most common etiological agent. The second most common HAI was VAP also with P. aeruginosa followed by BSI which was also associated with P. aeruginosa (in 2014) and Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (in 2015) as the most common etiological agents causing these infections. Conclusion: We found that HAI among our study population were predominantly caused by gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the only study that describes ICU-related HAI situation from a country within the Central Asian region. Many developing countries such as Kazakhstan lack surveillance systems which could effectively decrease incidence of HAIs and healthcare costs for their treatment. The epidemiological data on HAI in Kazakhstan currently is underrepresented and poorly reported in the literature. Based on this and previous studies, we propose that the most important interventions to prevent HAI at the NRCOT and similar Healthcare Institutions in Kazakhstan are active surveillance, regular infection control audits, rational and effective antibacterial therapy, and general hygiene measures."

We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism.

It has been postulated that a substantial portion of the disease burden seems to be mediated by the host immune activation to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, we present a simultaneous heart-kidney transplant (SHKT) recipient who was hospitalized for the management of respiratory failure from volume overload complicated by failure to thrive, multiple opportunistic infections, and open non-healing wounds in the setting of worsening renal dysfunction weeks prior to the first case of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in the state of Connecticut. After his third endotracheal intubation, routine nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2, in anticipation of a planned tracheostomy, was positive. His hemodynamics, respiratory status, and ventilator requirements remained stable without any worsening for 4 weeks until he had a negative NAT test. It is possible that the immunocompromised status of our patient may have prevented significant immune activation leading up to clinically significant cytokine storm that could have resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure."
